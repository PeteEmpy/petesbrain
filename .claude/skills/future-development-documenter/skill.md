# Future Development Documentation Skill

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze incomplete work and identify what's done vs. what's needed
- Format entries according to future-enhancements.md structure
- Determine appropriate priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Extract relevant files, scripts, and documentation
- Create comprehensive future development entries
- Link to existing documentation and code
- Identify blockers and dependencies

**Progressive Context Loading**:
1. **Metadata**: Skill purpose and trigger patterns
2. **Instructions**: How to document incomplete work properly
3. **Resources**: Future enhancements format, priority guidelines, existing entries

**Integration Points**:
- `docs/future-enhancements.md` - Main future developments document
- `docs/FUTURE-DEVELOPMENT/` - Detailed future development docs
- Code files with partial implementations
- Documentation files referencing incomplete features

**Example Usage**:
- "Document the WhatsApp processing as future development"
- "Add this incomplete feature to future enhancements"
- "This agent is half-finished, document it for later"
- "Create a future development entry for this blocked work"

**Output**:
- Properly formatted future development entry
- Links to relevant code and documentation
- Clear status (Partial Implementation, Blocked, etc.)
- Future development tasks organized by phase
- Decision points and dependencies identified
