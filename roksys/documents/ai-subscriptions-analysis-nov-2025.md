## Decision Matrix

### KEEP Claude Max (£90/month) IF:
- ✅ You use Claude Code daily (5+ hours/week)
- ✅ Automated workflows are business-critical (6 workflows running)
- ✅ You never hit usage limits
- ✅ Priority access/speed is essential for client work
- ✅ £90/month ROI is justified by time saved (think in billable hours)
- ✅ API balance unchanged (MAX models covered by subscription)

### DOWNGRADE to Claude Pro (£20/month) IF:
- ❌ You use Claude Code occasionally (< 5 hours/week)
- ❌ Automated workflows could run less frequently or be paused
- ❌ You never hit limits even on Pro tier
- ❌ £70/month savings (£840/year) would be significant
- ❌ Cursor handles most of your AI needs now (coding is primary use)

### DROP ChatGPT Plus (£16/month) IF:
- ❌ You rarely use it (< 2 times per week)
- ❌ Claude does everything ChatGPT does for your work
- ❌ Can't think of specific use cases where ChatGPT is superior
- ✅ £192/year savings would be useful

## Notes from Previous Analysis (Oct 30, 2025)

**Context when this was created:**
- You were testing "MAX Only" models in Cursor (Sonnet 4 1M, Opus 4.1)
- API balance baseline was $21.13
- Needed to verify if MAX models consume API credits or included in Claude Max subscription
- You hit a 30-min Cursor cooldown on Nov 3, prompting the Pro Plus upgrade

**Key insight from that conversation:**
> "The 30-minute wait you just experienced is a rate limit enforcement. This is the exact problem Pro Plus is designed to solve."

**Upgrade decision made:**
- Upgrade Cursor to Pro Plus immediately (solves blocking issue)
- Reassess Claude Max separately after 2 weeks of data (this document)
