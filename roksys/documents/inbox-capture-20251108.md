# Wispr Flow Note

Rock Systems note: The daily summary alerts are not working properly. They're too cluttered due to the fact that when it's being checked Google Ads doesn't have the figures for yesterday. It takes up to 24 hours for it to come through, so just question the validity of it. Maybe do the email at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon? That could work better.
