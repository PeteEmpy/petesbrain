## SECTION 1: Opening Paragraph (UPDATE EXISTING)

Look no further. With me and Rok Systems, that's exactly what you get. Someone who's lived and breathed paid search and digital marketing for over twenty-five years. Someone who knows exactly how to grow your revenue through effective pay-per-click marketing. And someone who genuinely wants to help you succeed. But you don't just get someone like me. **You get me.**

And here's what makes that different in 2025: I've built AI-powered tools that make me more effective than ever before. More on that below.

## SECTION 2: NEW SECTION TO ADD

**Add a new Elementor section after the "personal difference" section**

### Heading:
Personal service, amplified by AI

### Body text:

Here's where things get interesting. While other agencies are just starting to talk about AI, I've spent the last year building something that makes me more effective: AI-powered tools that act as an extension of my expertise.

What does that actually mean for you?

- **Automated monitoring** that helps me spot performance anomalies before they cost you money - not days later when you're reviewing a report, but in real-time
- **Institutional memory** that tracks every experiment, every change, and every outcome - so when something works, I know why, and I can apply those learnings to your account
- **AI-powered analysis** that helps me cross-reference your performance against platform updates, seasonal patterns, competitor activity, and product-level changes to explain exactly what's driving results
- **Evidence-based recommendations** backed by data from hundreds of successful tests I've run - not guesswork or gut feel

The result? You still get me, my expertise, and my personal attention. But now I've built tools that help me spot opportunities and catch issues faster than I ever could before.

And because I've built these tools myself, I understand exactly how they work and what they're telling me. I'm not outsourcing to some AI service I don't understand - I've engineered every piece of it.

## SECTION 3: Expertise Bullet Points (UPDATE EXISTING)

**Replace the existing bullet points with these:**

- I know how to build a best practice account structure that's highly effective
- I know first-hand how PPC has evolved over the last twenty-five years, which new features should be implemented, and I've built AI tools that help me stay ahead of every platform update
- I know what your business is going through, and what it takes to succeed
- I've built automated tools that help me catch problems before they become expensive, and spot opportunities before your competitors do

**And update the closing sentence to:**

And I'm going to use that knowledge - and those tools - to help your business grow.

---

## SECTION 4: Expert Services Intro (UPDATE EXISTING)

**Replace the intro paragraph with:**

Whether you want to maximise your ROI with Google's automated bidding strategies or reduce your overall ad spend through AI-powered optimization and detailed campaign analysis, I can help you and your business.

---

## SECTION 5: What You Get (ADD TO EXISTING LIST)

**Keep your existing three bullets, then add these three:**

- **AI-powered monitoring and analysis that I've built to run 24/7**
- **Real-time anomaly detection and performance alerts that come straight to me**
- **Evidence-based insights from my knowledge base of 150+ best practice articles**

---

## SECTION 6: What You Don't Get (ADD TO EXISTING LIST)

**Keep your existing three bullets, then add these two:**

- Generic AI tools that no one really understands
- Recommendations based on guesswork instead of data

---

## SECTION 7: PPC Consultancy Section (UPDATE ONE SENTENCE)

**Find this sentence:**
> I get into your business to fully understand it. I find out what sells and why. And I use that knowledge to drive adverts and campaigns that work.

**Replace with:**
> I get into your business to fully understand it. I find out what sells and why. And I use that knowledge - combined with AI-powered analysis tools I've built that most agencies can only dream of - to drive adverts and campaigns that work.

**Keep everything else the same, including:**
> Plain and simple. I help you grow your business.
