# 30 Min Meeting between Mike Rhodes and Peter Empson


### Claude Code vs Skills in Customer Projects

- Claude Code recommended over Skills for customer work
  - Better control and understanding of whatâs happening
  - Skills meant for agent-invoked tasks, Commands for user-invoked
  - Custom commands provide more direct control than vague Skills prompts
- Project structure critical for effectiveness
  - Customers, explainers, meeting notes, emails all need organized folders
  - Use.claudefolder with subfolders for agents, commands, skills
  - Createclaude.mdfiles at each level for context hierarchy

### Cursor Setup and Pricing Strategy

- Pay $20/month for Cursor + $80/month Claude Max plan (not API)
  - Avoids expensive API costs ($20-40/day typical usage)
  - Max plan rarely hits limits, provides predictable costs
  - Use/loginin Claude Code terminal, select Max plan over API key
- Cursor terminal workflow
  - Create aliasccdfor âclaude code dangerously skip permissionsâ
  - Use Command+J to open terminal, drag to top half of screen
  - Can run multiple Claude Code instances side-by-side

### Mikeâs âBrainâ System Architecture

- All business operations running through Claude Code on local machine
  - Gmail integration via Google Cloud project and MCP connectors
  - Automated email processing with Z-label system (Z-ethanmolic, Z-avanash)
  - GitHub actions run inbox checks 3x daily
- File structure in separate  folder (not Documents to avoid Mac sync issues)
  - Brain folder contains thousands of markdown files
  - Context folder with business details, customer info, personal data
  - YouTube transcripts, email newsletters automatically categorized
- One-shot automation examples
  - 47 personalized email drafts from CSV export
  - Slide deck generation from meeting context
  - Cross-repo file manipulation and zip creation

### Google Ads Integration Options

- GoMarble vs custom MCP decision
  - GoMarble provides good reproducible reports
  - Includes Shopify and Analytics integration (valuable for complex setups)
  - Custom MCP possible but requires additional Shopify/GA4 work
- Account audit workflow in development
  - Building composable skills that call multiple code snippets
  - Lego block approach - combine small skills into larger ones
  - Self-improving agents that learn from errors and update themselves

### Next Steps

- Reorganize current Claude Code structure using proper  folder hierarchy
- Read Claude Code documentation and YouTube resources (specifically mentioned Indie Dev Dance channel)
- Start simple with one command/skill, then build complexity gradually
- Implement alias for easier Claude Code access

## Manual Notes

Claude Code or Skills? Using them within customer projects

Project Structure in Claude - Customers explainers, meeting notes, emails 

Project structure in Cursor

 Do I need to pay for the Cursor console if I'm using my own Anthropic key? 

Best way to use an app, desktop or browser? Hanging all the apps together

Saving where I'm up to. 

Taking notes on the go

Gsheet issue

Gomarble or own MCP? If own then how to do Shopify and GA4

## Full Transcript

Very much.

Same if you're learning Italian.

Yes.

You just learn the meaning of 30 words, and all of a sudden everything gets much clearer.

I stand more chance of learning cloud code than do Italian. I just didn't. That's brilliant, Mike. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. I'll speak to you.

It's more useful too.

Welcome, peter.

Mate.

All right? Yeah.

Wait.
