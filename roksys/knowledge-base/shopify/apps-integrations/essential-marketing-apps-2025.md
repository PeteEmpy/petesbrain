## Installation Best Practices

**Before Installing**:
1. **Check reviews**: Read 20-30 recent reviews (not just overall rating)
2. **Free trial**: Always test before committing to paid plan
3. **Performance impact**: Check app doesn't slow site (use PageSpeed Insights)
4. **Support quality**: Test support response before relying on app
5. **Pricing transparency**: Understand what triggers higher tiers

**After Installing**:
1. **Test thoroughly**: Check app works on desktop and mobile
2. **Monitor speed**: Verify no significant page load impact
3. **Track ROI**: Measure app's impact on conversions and revenue
4. **Review quarterly**: Uninstall apps that aren't delivering value

**Red Flags**:
- Overwhelmingly negative recent reviews
- No response from developer to reviews
- Unclear pricing or hidden fees
- Requires custom code installation (risks during theme updates)
- Conflicts with other apps

## Avoiding App Bloat

**Common mistakes**:
- Installing apps for every feature (slows site)
- Overlapping functionality (3 apps doing same thing)
- Keeping unused apps installed
- Not measuring app ROI

**Solutions**:
1. **Quarterly audit**: Review all apps, uninstall unused
2. **Consolidate**: Use all-in-one apps where possible (e.g., Vitals)
3. **Measure impact**: Track each app's contribution to revenue
4. **Speed test**: Monitor site speed after each app installation

**Rule of thumb**: If app doesn't directly increase conversions/revenue or save significant time, consider removing

## ROI Measurement

### Email Marketing Apps
**Track**: Email revenue (attributed in Shopify Analytics)
**Target**: 10-20x ROI minimum (£10-20 revenue per £1 spent on app)
**Example**: £50/month Klavivo should drive £500-1,000 email revenue

### Upsell Apps
**Track**: Incremental revenue from upsells
**Target**: 20x ROI minimum (app pays for itself 20x over)
**Example**: £8/month ReConvert should generate £160+ additional revenue

### Review Apps
**Track**: Conversion rate improvement, organic traffic from reviews
**Target**: 5-10x ROI (harder to measure directly)
**Example**: £15/month review app should increase conversions enough to generate £75-150 additional revenue

### Analytics Apps
**Track**: Time saved, insights leading to optimization wins
**Target**: ROI through optimization (not directly measurable)
**Value**: Worth paying if it leads to better decision-making

## Key Insights

1. **Start minimal**: Use free apps and Shopify native features first
2. **Add strategically**: Install apps to solve specific problems, not speculatively
3. **Measure everything**: Track each app's ROI quarterly
4. **Speed matters**: Every app potentially slows your site (affects conversions)
5. **Consolidate when possible**: One app doing 3 things beats 3 separate apps
6. **Official integrations first**: Use Shopify-built apps when available
7. **Read recent reviews**: App quality changes over time
