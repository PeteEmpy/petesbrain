## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>We manage creatives for several DTC Health &amp; Wellness brands ($50k+ spend) and we are noticing a significant drop in performance for standard static ads in the last quarter.</p> <p>You all know the type of ad I'm talking about: The product bottle floating in a white void, maybe with a big &quot;50% OFF&quot; star-badge or some flat vector icons listing benefits.</p> <p><strong>The Problem: The &quot;Commodity Signal&quot;</strong> My hypothesis is that these standard visuals are hitting a wall of <strong>&quot;Banner Blindness&quot;</strong>. They look like the same dropshipping ads we've ignored for 10 years.</p> <p>Worse: For a premium supplement ($60+ AOV), a &quot;flat&quot; graphic subconsciously signals a &quot;cheap&quot; product. If the ad looks like it was made in Canva in 5 minutes, customers assume the ingredients are low quality too.</p> <p><strong>The Experiment: Visual Elevation</strong> We started testing a new workflow to fight Creative Fatigue, specifically for Retargeting. We are moving away from &quot;Graphic Design&quot; logic and moving towards &quot;Editorial/Cinematography&quot; logic.</p> <p><strong>What this looks like in practice (3 Examples):</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>From Diagram to Ritual:</strong> Instead of a flat 2D infographic showing a cycle, we created a scene with a physical wooden tray, real seeds, and hard lighting. It transforms a &quot;clinical diagram&quot; into something that looks like a premium daily wellness ritual.</li> <li><strong>From Packaging to Appetite:</strong> Instead of just the protein bag on a solid color background, we placed it on a marble counter surrounded by raw vanilla beans and texture. It triggers &quot;Appetite Appeal&quot; (taste) which a flat vector image simply can't do.</li> <li><strong>From Pharmacy to Lifestyle:</strong> Instead of a sterile white studio shot, we placed the bottle in a &quot;Golden Hour&quot; setting with plant shadows casting over the label. It reframes the product from &quot;medicine&quot; to &quot;morning self-care&quot;.</li> </ol> <p><strong>The Early Data:</strong> We are seeing that these &quot;Polished&quot; assets build significantly more trust in the Middle of Funnel (MOF) than the old standard graphics. The CTR is slightly lower than clickbaity UGC, but the <strong>Conversion Rate is higher</strong>.</p> <p><strong>My Question to the Media Buyers here:</strong> For a long time, the meta was &quot;Ugly sells&quot;. Are you seeing a shift back to highly polished, magazine-quality visuals to stand out in the feed? Or is the &quot;Raw/Ugly&quot; look still the undisputed king for you, even for premium brands?</p> <p>Curious to hear if &quot;Aesthetics&quot; are making a comeback in your data.</p> <p>Cheers, Ely</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Elybuely"> /u/Elybuely </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn7to5/is_banner_blindness_killing_standard_product/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn7to5/is_banner_blindness_killing_standard_product/">[comments]</a></span>
