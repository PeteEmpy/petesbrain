## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, what’s up?</p> <p>I’m trying to understand the best way to test creatives. From what I’ve read over the past few days, most people recommend starting with ABO campaigns, but I’m not fully clear on the exact process.</p> <p>Do you test audiences or interests first (for example, 4–5 different targetings using the same video), or do you test hooks first by running broad ad sets with multiple videos that only differ in the hook? How do you personally structure video testing?</p> <p>Once you find a winning hook or a winning audience, what’s the next step? Do you then test the body copy or the angle? In that case, which ads do you keep running, and which do you turn off?</p> <p>At what point do you consider an ad “good enough” to move into a CBO campaign for scaling? How long should it perform well in ABO, and what performance benchmarks do you look for before scaling?</p> <p>I know that’s a lot of questions, but I’d really appreciate any insight.<br /> Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gogy1919"> /u/Gogy1919 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnh0rb/abo_testing_strategy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnh0rb/abo_testing_strategy/">[comments]</a></span>
