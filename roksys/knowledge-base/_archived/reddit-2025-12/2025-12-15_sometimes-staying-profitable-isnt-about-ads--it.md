## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The past months were not easy. Higher costs, tighter margins, constant pressure to make every dollar count.</p> <p>I kept optimizing campaigns, but at some point you realize there’s a limit to how much you can squeeze from ads alone.</p> <p>What actually helped me stay in the game came from an unexpected place — the payment side.</p> <p>I ended up using a third-party payment system that returns part of the spend when you pay FB billings over a certain amount. I didn’t trust it at first, so I tested it slowly and kept expectations low.</p> <p>Over time, it turned out to be consistently reliable.</p> <p>Getting 20% back on larger billing payments didn’t make bad campaigns good — but it did reduce pressure and gave me more room to scale what was already working.</p> <p>I’m not sharing this as a recommendation or a shortcut. Just a reminder that sometimes the difference between surviving and quitting isn’t creatives or targeting — it’s the infrastructure around your spend.</p> <p>Curious if anyone else here found similar “non-obvious” leverage points outside of ads themselves.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlmaMeyer-_-"> /u/AlmaMeyer-_- </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnfsfd/sometimes_staying_profitable_isnt_about_ads_its/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnfsfd/sometimes_staying_profitable_isnt_about_ads_its/">[comments]</a></span>

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Payment optimization strategies for Facebook Ads spend
**Reason**: The article provides an interesting but peripheral insight into managing advertising costs through third-party payment systems, which is tangentially relevant to Facebook Ads strategy but not a core advertising technique
