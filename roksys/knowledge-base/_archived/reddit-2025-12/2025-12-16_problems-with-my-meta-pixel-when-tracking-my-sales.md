## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I'm having a problem with Meta tracking my ebook sales, which I sell through the Hotmart platform. Meta is only tracking sales made with credit or debit cards, but sales with other payment methods (PayPal, or payment slips like OXXO, Yape, or Sencillito) aren't being tracked, even though these represent 70% of my sales. I have very few card sales. Meta shows my last sale as being 3 weeks ago (which is my last card sale), when in reality, my last sale was yesterday, and it was made with PayPal. After reviewing tutorials, I watched several videos explaining how to correctly configure the pixel, and upon checking, I was following all the steps correctly, such as setting it to track immediate payments (card) and non-immediate payments (other payment methods), and differentiating between the two so that only completed sales are tracked. I've been dealing with this problem for a month and a half now, and despite this, I've had several sales of my ebook. However, because of this issue, I haven't been able to scale my campaign yet. I'm currently at -$45 between what I've invested and earned, and without this problem, I'd already be in the black, and my product would possibly be scaled and established. What can I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PuzzleheadedTart9890"> /u/PuzzleheadedTart9890 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnjtln/problems_with_my_meta_pixel_when_tracking_my_sales/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnjtln/problems_with_my_meta_pixel_when_tracking_my_sales/">[comments]</a></span>
