## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, hoping someone here has experience with a similar issue or can offer advice.</p> <p>We are currently facing a critical problem with a failed payment on our Meta Ad Account that has resulted in ₹50,000 being stuck for <strong>20 days</strong> now.</p> <p><strong>The Details:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Date of Failed Transaction:</strong> November 21st.</li> <li><strong>Amount Stuck:</strong> INR 50,000.</li> <li><strong>Status:</strong> The amount was debited from our bank account immediately, but has <strong>not been credited</strong> to our ad account and has <strong>not been refunded</strong> to the bank.</li> <li><strong>Transaction ID:</strong> 25491458713875437-25429520703402571</li> </ul> <p><strong>Our Follow-up:</strong></p> <ul> <li>We immediately contacted Meta Support.</li> <li>Five days ago, we received confirmation that the issue was escalated under <strong>Case ID 2258529791294859</strong> with a promise of an urgent resolution/update.</li> <li><strong>Crucially, there has been absolutely NO UPDATE since then.</strong> No email, no credit, no refund.</li> </ul> <p>We are effectively out ₹50,000 and have no timeline or communication from Meta on how or when this will be resolved. We rely on this account for our business.</p> <p><strong>Has anyone else dealt with a payment being stuck for this long after an escalation? What were your next steps?</strong></p> <p>Any advice on how to get this resolution fast-short of filing a formal bank dispute-would be highly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OldTower8429"> /u/OldTower8429 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1po235u/20_days_50000_missing_meta_ad_payment_debited_but/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1po235u/20_days_50000_missing_meta_ad_payment_debited_but/">[comments]</a></span>
