It’s getting <em>selective</em>.</p> <p>Lead campaigns are hurting (CPL +21%, conversions down), especially in hyper-competitive verticals like Dental and Finance.

It’s punishing lazy lead forms and generic offers.</p> <p>If you’re still running leads cold → form → hope for the best… yeah, that’s not 2025 anymore.</p> <p>Full breakdown, data, and strategy implications here:<br /> 👉 <a href="https://giovanniperilli.com/en/blog/facebook-ad-costs-2025-why-lead-campaigns-struggle-while-traffic-ads-continue-to-outperform/">https://giovanniperilli.com/en/blog/facebook-ad-costs-2025-why-lead-campaigns-struggle-while-traffic-ads-continue-to-outperform/</a></p> <p>Curious to hear: are you seeing the same split between traffic and leads in your accounts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Loud_Firefighter5848"> /u/Loud_Firefighter5848 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnvaw7/facebook_ad_costs_2025_why_lead_campaigns/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnvaw7/facebook_ad_costs_2025_why_lead_campaigns/">[comments]</a></span>
