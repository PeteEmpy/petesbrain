## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really want this to be true.</p> <p>I want to be able to stop worrying about audience targeting and just focus on creatives.</p> <p>If “creative is the new targeting” actually worked reliably, it would simplify everything.</p> <p>But I’m not seeing it in my own account.</p> <p>Every week I run a broad “no detailed targeting” adset alongside others.</p> <p>And every week I hope this is the week it finally carries performance on its own.</p> <p>So far, it hasn’t.</p> <p>What I keep running into is that relying on a single broad adset just isn’t stable enough to stay above ROAS target week to week - especially lately with how volatile the auction’s been.</p> <p>So I’m genuinely curious:</p> <p>Is anyone here <em>personally</em> seeing consistent success relying mainly on one broad adset? Or are you still having to lean on audience-level targeting to smooth things out?</p> <p>Not asking what Meta recommends - asking what’s actually working for you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HopefulReality2"> /u/HopefulReality2 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnxsle/is_anyone_actually_scaling_consistently_with_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnxsle/is_anyone_actually_scaling_consistently_with_a/">[comments]</a></span>
