## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I audit accounts constantly where the founder complains that performance is a rollercoaster.</p> <p>90% of the time, the issue isn't the creative. It’s the structure.</p> <p>They are dumping new, unproven creatives directly into their main Scaling CBO.</p> <p>This destroys your stability.</p> <p>When you introduce a new variable (a fresh video/image) into a stable CBO, you force the algorithm to redistribute the budget. Often, the algorithm sees high initial engagement on the new ad (clickbait), dumps your budget into it, and starves your actual proven winner.</p> <p>When the new ad inevitably fails to convert at scale, your blended ROAS tanks, and you’ve successfully killed your best performer in the process.</p> <ol> <li><p>Create a completely separate campaign for testing. 1 Ad Set = 1 Creative Concept.</p></li> <li><p>An ad stays here until it proves it can spend at your target CPA for 3-5 days.</p></li> <li><p>Only after it wins in the Sandbox do you take the Post ID and move it to the Scaling CBO.</p></li> <li><p>Your CBO is for scaling proven assets, not for finding them.</p></li> </ol> <p>Stop gambling with your main revenue source. Isolate your tests, prove the math, and only scale what is already working.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Upbeat-Ad5487"> /u/Upbeat-Ad5487 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1po0wzd/stop_testing_new_creatives_in_your_scaling_cbo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1po0wzd/stop_testing_new_creatives_in_your_scaling_cbo/">[comments]</a></span>
