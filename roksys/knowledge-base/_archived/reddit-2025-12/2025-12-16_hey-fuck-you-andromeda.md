## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don’t usually swear in post titles, but honestly… Andromeda has made it way easier to spot which ad accounts were already broken.</p> <p>If your Meta performance feels random lately, it’s probably not because Andromeda “ruined” your account. It’s because it’s exposing what the system was trained on in the first place.</p> <p>I was on a call recently where a founder asked:<br /> “I’ve tested dozens of audiences. Nothing works. What targeting should I try next?”</p> <p>We didn’t talk about audiences at all.</p> <p>They’d been running traffic campaigns for weeks to “build data” before switching to conversions.</p> <p>So the pixel had data, sure.<br /> Just data from people who click everything and buy nothing.</p> <p>Andromeda didn’t cause that problem. It just accelerated it.</p> <p>Meta clusters creatives more aggressively now. It decides what’s “similar enough” faster. When your account is trained on low-quality signals, Andromeda basically says: “Cool, I know exactly who this is for,” and keeps doubling down.</p> <p>That’s why people are seeing:</p> <ul> <li>new creatives not behaving like new creatives</li> <li>ads collapsing into the same learning bucket</li> <li>performance that feels sticky in a bad way</li> </ul> <p>If your pixel is polluted, Andromeda locks you into it quicker.</p> <p>I’ve seen this a lot with accounts that spent months optimizing for:</p> <ul> <li>traffic</li> <li>engagement</li> <li>add to carts</li> </ul> <p>Not because those advertisers were dumb - but because it <em>used to</em> feel safer.</p> <p>Now those decisions come back to bite you.</p> <p>Same products. Same offers. Same creatives.<br /> Different outcome once the account is rebuilt around purchase signals.</p> <p>When the data is clean, Andromeda actually helps.<br /> When it’s not, it just makes the mess more obvious.</p> <p>Most advice floating around assumes you’re already getting consistent purchase volume. A lot of accounts aren’t. They’re trying to run “advanced” setups on top of bad training data and wondering why Meta feels unpredictable.</p> <p>Before changing anything else, I usually just look at:</p> <ul> <li>what events the pixel has actually learned from</li> <li>what the account has been optimized for historically</li> <li>how much real purchase volume exists</li> </ul> <p>If you’re under ~50 purchases a month, Meta behaves very differently — Andromeda or not.</p> <p>Anyway. Curious if others are seeing the same thing:</p> <ul> <li>Did Andromeda help you?</li> <li>Or did it expose problems you didn’t realize were there?</li> </ul> <p>Not selling anything. Just venting and comparing notes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Silly_Weight_9272"> /u/Silly_Weight_9272 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnj0dq/hey_fuck_you_andromeda/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnj0dq/hey_fuck_you_andromeda/">[comments]</a></span>
