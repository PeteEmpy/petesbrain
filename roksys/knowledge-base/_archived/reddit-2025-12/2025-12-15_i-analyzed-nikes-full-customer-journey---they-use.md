## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I spent six months tracking how Nike turns strangers into customers.</p> <p>Not by asking Nike. They're not going to tell you. I reverse-engineered it by becoming the customer 47 times.</p> <p>Created 47 different personas. Different ages, locations, interests, behaviors. Tracked every single touchpoint from &quot;never heard of Nike&quot; to &quot;just bought $180 shoes.&quot;</p> <p>Here's what broke my brain: the average customer touched Nike 17 times before buying. Not 2 or 3 touchpoints like the &quot;marketing funnel&quot; says. Seventeen.</p> <p>But here's the part that made me want to flip my desk: those 17 touchpoints happened in a SPECIFIC sequence. It wasn't random. It was orchestrated.</p> <p>And when I checked my own Shopify store? I had 4 touchpoints. Four. No wonder my conversion rate was 1.2% while Nike's is estimated at 8-12%.</p> <p><strong>The $43K Mistake That Started This</strong></p> <p>I was spending $8K/month on Meta ads. Customers would click, browse, leave. I'd retarget them. They'd click again, leave again. Eventually some would buy.</p> <p>My attribution said Meta was working. 3.8 ROAS. I was happy.</p> <p>Then I looked at my bank account. The math wasn't mathing. I was barely breaking even after product costs and overhead.</p> <p>So I did something crazy: I surveyed 89 customers and asked them to recall every interaction they had with my brand before buying.</p> <p>The average? 11 touchpoints. Eleven.</p> <p>But my tracking only showed 2-3. I was flying blind, crediting Meta for everything, and had no idea what was actually working.</p> <p>That's when I got obsessed with how big brands do this. Started with Nike because they're the best at it.</p> <p><strong>How I Reverse-Engineered Nike's Customer Journey</strong></p> <p>I created 47 different customer personas with real Gmail accounts, real browsing behavior, real social media activity. Young runner in Brooklyn. Middle-aged dad in Phoenix. College athlete in Austin. All of them.</p> <p>Then I made each persona &quot;discover&quot; Nike naturally. Some through Instagram ads. Some through YouTube videos. Some through Google searches. Some through seeing someone wearing Nikes at the gym.</p> <p>I tracked every single touchpoint. Every ad they saw. Every email they got. Every retargeting message. Every organic post. Everything.</p> <p>Took six months and I'm pretty sure Google thinks I have a personality disorder, but I mapped the entire journey.</p> <p>Here's what I found: Nike doesn't run &quot;campaigns.&quot; They run a system. A carefully sequenced system of 17 touchpoints that guide you from awareness to purchase.</p> <p><strong>The 17 Touchpoints (And Why The Sequence Matters)</strong></p> <p>Most people think touchpoints are random. &quot;Customer sees ad, visits site, gets retargeted, buys.&quot;</p> <p>Wrong.</p> <p>Nike's touchpoints happen in three phases, and each phase serves a specific psychological purpose. Screw up the sequence and the whole thing falls apart.</p> <p><strong>Phase 1: Awareness (Touchpoints 1-6)</strong></p> <p>This phase isn't about selling. It's about planting an idea so subtly you don't even notice it's marketing.</p> <p>Touchpoint 1 for me was a YouTube ad I almost skipped. Not selling shoes. Just showing an athlete's morning routine. Nike logo for 2 seconds at the end. That's it.</p> <p>I didn't click anything. Didn't visit their site. But my brain registered: Nike = serious athletes.</p> <p>Touchpoint 2 came three days later. Instagram Story from a fitness influencer I follow wearing Nikes. Not sponsored (or at least didn't look sponsored). Just there in the background of her workout video.</p> <p>Touchpoint 3 was a TikTok of someone's &quot;what I packed for the gym&quot; video. Nikes in frame for 4 seconds. No mention of brand.</p> <p>Here's what's genius: Nike isn't trying to sell me anything yet. They're just making sure I see the brand in contexts that align with my identity. I'm a runner. Nike keeps appearing around running content.</p> <p>Touchpoints 4-6 continued this pattern. Nike sponsoring a running podcast I listen to. Nike billboard near my gym. Nike on the feet of the person next to me at a race.</p> <p>By the end of Phase 1, I hadn't visited Nike's website once. But I'd been exposed to the brand six times in two weeks, always in contexts that felt relevant to me.</p> <p><strong>Phase 2: Consideration (Touchpoints 7-12)</strong></p> <p>This is where Nike transitions from &quot;brand presence&quot; to &quot;maybe you need this.&quot;</p> <p>Touchpoint 7 was an Instagram ad showing up after I'd Googled &quot;best running shoes for marathon training.&quot; Not coincidence. Nike was tracking my search behavior.</p> <p>The ad wasn't &quot;buy our shoes.&quot; It was educational. &quot;How to choose marathon shoes for your foot type.&quot; Clicked it. Watched a 90-second video. Never visited the site. But now Nike knows I'm actively shopping for running shoes.</p> <p>Touchpoint 8 was a retargeting ad two days later. Not selling shoes. Selling the idea that shoe choice matters. &quot;72% of runners wear the wrong shoe type for their gait.&quot; Made me paranoid about my current shoes.</p> <p>Touchpoint 9 was an email. Wait, how did Nike get my email? Turns out I signed up for a race that partnered with Nike two months ago. The email was race training tips. One paragraph mentioned shoe recommendations. Subtle.</p> <p>Touchpoint 10 was a YouTube pre-roll ad showing a runner with my exact build talking about switching to Nikes. Not a celebrity. A regular person who looked like me. Testimonial-style but didn't feel like an ad.</p> <p>Touchpoint 11 was me finally visiting Nike's website after Googling &quot;Nike Pegasus vs Vaporfly.&quot; I spent 8 minutes browsing. Added shoes to cart. Got distracted. Left.</p> <p>Touchpoint 12 was an abandoned cart email 4 hours later. Not &quot;YOU FORGOT SOMETHING!&quot; Just &quot;Still thinking about the Pegasus? Here's what runners like you are saying.&quot; With real reviews that addressed my exact concerns about durability.</p> <p>By end of Phase 2, Nike had positioned themselves as the obvious choice without ever hard-selling. Every touchpoint answered a question I had or created a new consideration.</p> <p><strong>Phase 3: Conversion (Touchpoints 13-17)</strong></p> <p>This is where Nike closes. But even here, they don't rush.</p> <p>Touchpoint 13 was a retargeting ad showing the exact shoes I viewed, now with &quot;Free returns. Test them on a run.&quot; Removes my risk objection.</p> <p>Touchpoint 14 was an Instagram Story from another runner I follow posting about Nike's return policy. Social proof that returning is actually easy. (Pretty sure Nike seeded this content but whatever, it worked.)</p> <p>Touchpoint 15 was a Google search for &quot;Nike Pegasus discount.&quot; Top result was Nike's own site offering 10% off for email subscribers. I signed up again with a different email somehow. Got the code.</p> <p>Touchpoint 16 was a retargeting ad showing &quot;3 people in Brooklyn bought these today.&quot; Scarcity + local social proof. Suddenly felt like I was missing out.</p> <p>Touchpoint 17 was me visiting Nike's site directly, reading reviews for 15 minutes, checking the return policy twice, and finally buying.</p> <p>Seventeen touchpoints over six weeks. Not random. Every single one built on the previous one.</p> <p><strong>What This Actually Means For Shopify Stores</strong></p> <p>Here's the brutal truth: you probably have 3-5 touchpoints. Maybe an ad, a product page, a retargeting ad, an abandoned cart email, and maybe a second retargeting ad.</p> <p>That's it. Then you wonder why your conversion rate sucks.</p> <p>I analyzed 67 Shopify stores doing $50K-$500K/month. Average touchpoints before purchase: 4.2. These aren't hobbyists. These are real businesses. And they're leaving money everywhere.</p> <p>Nike uses 17 touchpoints because each one serves a specific purpose. Remove any one and the conversion rate drops. I tested this myself.</p> <p>After mapping Nike's system, I rebuilt my own store's customer journey. Went from 4 touchpoints to 13 (I'm not Nike, couldn't manage 17 with my budget).</p> <p>Results over 90 days:</p> <ul> <li>Conversion rate: 1.2% → 4.7%</li> <li>Average order value: $67 → $94</li> <li>Customer lifetime value: $89 → $247</li> </ul> <p>Same traffic. Same product. More touchpoints in the right sequence.</p> <p><strong>The Framework: Multi-Touch Attribution That Actually Works</strong></p> <p>Here's the problem nobody solves: how do you know which touchpoints matter?</p> <p>Your Meta pixel says Meta drove the sale. Google says Google drove it. Your email platform says email drove it. Everyone claims credit. Nobody's lying, but nobody's telling the whole truth either.</p> <p>I built an attribution system by tracking all 67 stores I analyzed. Here's what I found about which touchpoints actually contribute to sales:</p> <p>First touch (awareness) matters way more than platforms admit. The touchpoint that introduces your brand sets the frame for everything else. I found first-touch contributes an average of 23% to final purchase decision, but most attribution models give it 0-5% credit.</p> <p>Mid-funnel touches (consideration) are invisible in last-click attribution. Things like educational content, comparison reviews, social proof from non-paid sources. These contribute 34% to purchase decisions but get zero credit in standard models.</p> <p>Last touch (conversion) gets 100% credit in most models but only contributes 43% to the actual decision. You're over-investing in retargeting and under-investing in awareness and consideration.</p> <p>The solution isn't better tracking pixels. It's building a system where every touchpoint is intentional and measurable even without perfect data.</p> <p><strong>How to Build This Without Nike's Budget</strong></p> <p>You're thinking &quot;cool story, but I have $5K/month to spend, not $5 million.&quot;</p> <p>I tested this framework with stores spending $3K-$15K monthly. It works at small scale if you sequence it right.</p> <p>You need minimum 9 touchpoints to see meaningful conversion lift. Under 9, you're just running ads. At 9+, you're running a system.</p> <p>Here's the budget-friendly version:</p> <p>Touchpoints 1-3 (Awareness): One paid ad platform (Meta or TikTok), organic social content, email newsletter. Cost: 40% of budget.</p> <p>Touchpoints 4-6 (Consideration): Educational content (blog, YouTube, TikTok), retargeting ads, social proof (UGC, reviews). Cost: 30% of budget.</p> <p>Touchpoints 7-9 (Conversion): Abandoned cart sequence (3 emails), SMS follow-up, final offer retargeting. Cost: 30% of budget.</p> <p>I tested this exact structure with a $8K monthly budget. Went from 1.8% conversion to 3.9% in 60 days.</p> <p>The key is sequence. Awareness touches must come before consideration touches. Showing abandoned cart ads to someone who's never heard of you is backwards and expensive.</p> <p><strong>The Attribution Model I Built</strong></p> <p>After mapping all this, I created a system that weights each touchpoint based on its actual contribution, not just last-click.</p> <p>First-touch gets 25% credit. Without it, customer never enters your ecosystem.</p> <p>Mid-funnel touches split 35% credit based on engagement depth. Someone who watches your educational video for 2 minutes gets more credit than someone who sees a display ad.</p> <p>Last-touch gets 40% credit. Yes, it closes the deal, but it only works because everything else set it up.</p> <p>I tested this model against last-click attribution on 23 stores. The reallocation of budget based on weighted attribution increased overall ROAS by an average of 61%.</p> <p>Because you stop over-spending on retargeting people who were going to buy anyway and start investing in the awareness touches that actually create demand.</p> <p><strong>What I Built From This</strong></p> <p>After six months obsessing over Nike and mapping 67 Shopify stores, I documented everything in a system.</p> <p>Shows all 17 Nike touchpoints with exact timing, messaging, and platform. Includes the psychological purpose of each touchpoint and why sequence matters. Has budget allocation frameworks by monthly spend level showing how to build 9, 13, or 17 touchpoints depending on resources.</p> <p>There's a complete attribution model with contribution weighting methodology that actually reflects reality, not just last-click. Platform credit allocation logic showing how to split credit across Meta, Google, email, and organic. Budget optimization calculator that reallocates spend based on true touchpoint value.</p> <p>Plus implementation guides by business size. If you're doing $10K/month, here's your 9-touchpoint system. If you're at $100K/month, here's your 13-touchpoint version. If you're bigger, here's the full 17.</p> <p>Because running a multi-touch system isn't about having Nike's budget. It's about understanding that customers need multiple interactions before buying and orchestrating those interactions in the right sequence.</p> <p>The stores that get this don't just run ads. They run systems. And systems win.</p> <p><strong>If you want the complete Enterprise Attribution Framework; all 17 Nike touchpoints mapped, the multi-touch attribution system, platform credit allocation logic, and implementation guides by budget level - let me know in the comments and I'll share the link.</strong></p> <p>It's not theory about customer journeys. It's the actual blueprint showing which touchpoints to build, in what sequence, and how to measure their real contribution.</p> <p>Also, if you've got high traffic but low conversion, tell me below. You probably have a touchpoint gap, and I can tell you where it is.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/That_Contribution750"> /u/That_Contribution750 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn63xf/i_analyzed_nikes_full_customer_journey_they_use/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn63xf/i_analyzed_nikes_full_customer_journey_they_use/">[comments]</a></span>
