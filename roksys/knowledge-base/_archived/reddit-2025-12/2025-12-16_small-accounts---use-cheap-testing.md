## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those with smaller accounts….</p> <p>I ran ads all 2024 and none this year. I'm relaunching the same thing as before, scaled regionally right now. </p> <p>I just wanted to say I've noticed no significant changes since this Andromeda thing. </p> <p>I still followed the same path and it works. Allocated 500.00 for three weeks of small scale traffic testing. Running conversion campaigns broad in a single ad per ad set. </p> <p>Conversions this week. 250.00 offer. Nothing poisoned my pixel. Don’t be afraid to use the cheap optimizations for testing. Facebook isn't dumb and I actually think if your offer and product is good it can perform better at small budgets. That's why people duplicate so many low budget ads to horizontally scale. </p> <p>Anyway the algorithm isn't stupid. It didn't confuse my traffic, engagement and awareness tests for who to send my sales campaign to. </p> <p>And if youve read this far there's my tip.</p> <p>RUN A 5.00 A DAY AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. </p> <p>the algorithm wants confidence in your audience. it wants to see you building a funnel. If you don’t, it will do it for you and charge you incredibly high CPM’s.</p> <p>if you do, it will reward you with lower CPM’s across all of your campaigns.</p> <p>your awareness campaign should have absolutely no targeting on it whatsoever unless you’re doing something local or regional </p> <p>Otherwise, you’re awareness campaign should be completely open and broad. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlowerFarmerTX"> /u/FlowerFarmerTX </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnn2or/small_accounts_use_cheap_testing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnn2or/small_accounts_use_cheap_testing/">[comments]</a></span>
