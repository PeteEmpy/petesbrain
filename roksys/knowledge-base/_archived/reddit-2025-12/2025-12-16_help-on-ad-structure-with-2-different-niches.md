## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We sell products across two men’s categories: men’s skincare and sexual performance. They target the same general customer base (men of all ages, with sexual performance skewing slightly older). We’ve been operating for a while, and current customer overlap between the two categories is ~5%.</p> <p>We spend almost $200k/month on Google Ads and are looking to scale Meta to a similar level.</p> <p>My main questions are around campaign structure:</p> <p>• ⁠For prospecting, should men’s skincare and sexual performance be in separate campaigns, or combined? • ⁠Does the same logic apply to scale, retargeting, and retention campaigns, or should those be category-specific?</p> <p>Margins are the same across products, but LTV differs slightly between the two categories.</p> <p>Appreciate any insight!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Purple_Building5002"> /u/Purple_Building5002 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnvjn9/help_on_ad_structure_with_2_different_niches/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnvjn9/help_on_ad_structure_with_2_different_niches/">[comments]</a></span>
