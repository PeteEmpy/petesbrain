## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My last post about top performance marketing brands got some attention, so I thought I'd make a follow-up.</p> <p>This time I'm focusing on brands actually spending hundreds of thousands on the EU/UK market specifically. These are the brands with massive active ad counts in Europe. Most of them have way more ads running outside the EU, which means they're operating at an even higher scale worldwide.</p> <p>After receiving feedback that some of the brands were &quot;branding&quot; plays, I decided to focus 100% on performance brands. These are performance-focused DTC and app brands optimizing for ROAS, testing creative strategies weekly, and scaling what works.</p> <p>Here are 9 brands crushing it in EU/UK (and also WW) right now:</p> <h1>1. Loop (14,022 active ads)</h1> <p>Premium earplugs that turned a commodity product into a fashion accessory.</p> <p>They're running ads in 11 different languages with 182M+ total EU reach. Their localization game is unmatched — same winning concepts adapted for every major market. They let winners run for 200+ days while constantly testing new angles.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1225102349320243"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 222 days ago, live. 8.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 ~€107K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1275477364246325"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 126 days ago, live. 4.4M EU reach, 3x creative (💰💰 ~€53K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/2015663765868742"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 88 days ago, live. 4.1M EU reach, 3x creative (💰💰 ~€49K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 114 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>This discount won't wait forever. </code></pre> <p>Simple urgency. They also crush it with ADHD-focused messaging (&quot;People with ADHD are not just lazy and unmotivated&quot;) and gifting angles.</p> <h1>2. The Ridge (1,276 active ads)</h1> <p>Wallet and accessories brand that made wallets cool again with premium materials and smart features.</p> <p>They focus on English-only content for US/UK markets but dominate with product-led storytelling. Their Kintsugi collection ran for 258 days with 4.3M reach — they find winners and let them run.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/960331649418900"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 258 days ago. 4.3M EU reach (💰💰 ~€52K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/734512885752065"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 158 days ago. 1.5M EU reach (💰 ~€18K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1531497301214409"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 39 days ago, live. 1.4M EU reach (💰 ~€17K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 10 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>Your wallet sucks. That's why we invented the Ridge Wallet. </code></pre> <p>Direct, provocative, and positions them as the solution. They also dominate wedding ring content with hooks like &quot;Men's wedding rings suck, so we created something better.&quot;</p> <h1>3. HexClad (843 active ads)</h1> <p>Gordon Ramsay-backed cookware brand that's mastered the &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; angle.</p> <p>They run a mix of celebrity endorsement (Gordon), UGC testimonials, and recipe content. The &quot;why it costs €1000&quot; justification ads perform incredibly well — they're not hiding the price, they're explaining the value.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/674675868548161"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 84 days ago, live. 4.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 ~€59K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/2998387620362711"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 68 days ago, live. 2.7M EU reach (💰💰 ~€32K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1539745014031292"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 68 days ago, live. 1.6M EU reach (💰 ~€19K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 17 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>This is the best gift on the planet. </code></pre> <p>They lean heavily into gifting and holiday angles. Also crushing it with &quot;Why I'll NEVER buy Gordon Ramsay's non-toxic pan&quot; reverse psychology hooks. I found this hook across A LOT of brands and it's been working well for us too.</p> <h1>4. Leaf Co (318 active ads)</h1> <p>French skincare brand dominating the collagen mask niche with before/after testimonials.</p> <p>They're 100% focused on the French market with UGC from real women (especially mature skin). The transformation format is simple but incredibly effective — they show the mask going on, time passing, and the visible results.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1714420702547346"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 100 days ago, live. 6.4M EU reach, 5x creative (💰💰💰 ~€77K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/4174387169469219"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 47 days ago. 1.8M EU reach, 5x creative (💰 ~€21K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/2801957659995635"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 100 days ago, live. 1.3M EU reach, 5x creative (💰 ~€16K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 6 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>Ce masque collagène partout mais jamais testé sur une peau mature. Alors je vais l'essayer pour vous. (This collagen mask is everywhere but never tested on mature skin. So I'm going to try it for you.) </code></pre> <p>The &quot;testing for mature skin&quot; angle is genius — they're speaking directly to their 40+ female audience who feel ignored by skincare marketing.</p> <h1>5. The Essence Vault (229 active ads)</h1> <p>UK fragrance brand selling &quot;designer-inspired&quot; perfumes at a fraction of the price.</p> <p>They use urgency like nobody else — &quot;SCENT PRICES HIKE INCOMING&quot; warnings that create FOMO. Their visual style is clean and premium, making £15 perfumes look like £200 bottles.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1300154065212432"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 6 days ago, live. 2.6M EU reach, 4x creative (💰💰 ~€31K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/691801213801959"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 6 days ago, live. 1.3M EU reach, 4x creative (💰 ~€16K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1850804995551461"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 73 days ago, live. 838K EU reach (💰 ~€10K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 4 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>What are the top three best sellers on the Essence Vault? </code></pre> <p>Curiosity-driven listicle format. They also use comparison hooks like &quot;Take Baccarat Rouge for example, sells for £245. Meanwhile, the Essence Vault's version sells for £15.&quot;</p> <h1>6. Endel (8 active ads but 11M+ reach)</h1> <p>The ultimate example of quality over quantity. This ADHD/focus app runs just 8 active ads but achieves massive scale.</p> <p>They found the perfect hook — 852 Hz sounds for ADHD brains — and let it run. Their meme-style content (&quot;me listening to this sound 24/7 ever since I found out it blocks your brain from overthinking&quot;) drives insane engagement.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1860830991492795"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 47 days ago, live. 6.3M EU reach, 2x creative (💰💰💰 ~€76K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/4041880446064249"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 168 days ago. 5.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 ~€71K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1454773869009255"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 146 days ago. 5.0M EU reach (💰💰 ~€60K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook:</strong></p> <pre><code>This sound is 852 Hz. If you have ADHD, listen for 10 seconds and see how your brain reacts. </code></pre> <p>Interactive hooks that make you stop and actually engage. The meme format also works incredibly well — a dog on a train with text about blocking overthinking went viral.</p> <h1>7. AG1 by Athletic Greens (362 active ads)</h1> <p>The supplement giant with aggressive German/Dutch localization.</p> <p>They run problem/solution format ads targeting morning fatigue, brain fog, and digestion issues. The Black Friday bundle offers with &quot;€88 GRATIS&quot; value stacking perform exceptionally well in German markets.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/792807713518393"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 40 days ago. 1.4M EU reach (💰 ~€17K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/803131242567221"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 40 days ago. 916K EU reach (💰 ~€11K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1293336925733645"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 150 days ago. 565K EU reach (💰 ~€7K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 9 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>Time to lock in on your health. </code></pre> <p>They also use creative formats like a woman holding signs listing problems (brain fog, tired, digestion) that flip to solutions.</p> <h1>8. WHOOP (45 active ads)</h1> <p>Wearable fitness tracker with aggressive EU localization push.</p> <p>They're running Portuguese, German, and English variants of discount offers. The &quot;10% off annual memberships&quot; angle is consistent across all markets — they've found what works and are scaling it geographically.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1233610935250731"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 4 days ago, live. 1.7M EU reach (💰 ~€21K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1123060939907347"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 4 days ago, live. 428K EU reach (💰 ~€5K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/25697937783134440"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 4 days ago, live. 217K EU reach (💰 ~€3K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 5 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>There's still time to save 10% on Whoop memberships. </code></pre> <p>Urgency + discount. Simple but effective for a premium product.</p> <h1>9. Reverse Health (33 active ads)</h1> <p>Intermittent fasting app crushing it in Italian and Spanish markets.</p> <p>They use localized testimonials and &quot;lose X kg without exercise&quot; messaging. The before/after transformation format dominates their creative strategy.</p> <p><a href="https://skaler.app/ad/1083185000441117"><strong>Example 1</strong></a> – Launched 149 days ago. 2.7M EU reach (💰💰 ~€33K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/790433980002960"><strong>Example 2</strong></a> – Launched 146 days ago. 1.7M EU reach, 2x creative (💰 ~€21K spend)<br /> <a href="https://skaler.app/ad/776307845085981"><strong>Example 3</strong></a> – Launched 149 days ago. 1.5M EU reach (💰 ~€18K spend)</p> <p><strong>Their top hook (used in 3 ads):</strong></p> <pre><code>Il tuo caffè nero senza zucchero. Vuoi un dessert? (Your black coffee without sugar. Want a dessert?) </code></pre> <p>Conversational Italian that feels native, not translated.</p> <h1>Key Patterns I Noticed</h1> <p><strong>1. Localization separates the winners:</strong> Loop runs 11 languages, AG1 dominates German markets, Leaf Co owns French skincare. The brands winning in EU aren't just translating — they're actually creating native content (and possibly have in-house deps for it).</p> <p><strong>2. Before/after still works:</strong> Leaf Co, Reverse Health, and even HexClad (for cookware results) all use transformation content. It's an evergreen format.</p> <p><strong>3. Let winners run:</strong> Endel runs 8 ads with 11M+ reach. The Ridge ran one ad for 258 days. Loop keeps winners live for 200+ days. Don't retire what's working.</p> <p><strong>4. Duplicated creatives within different audiences:</strong> Multiple brands run the same creative across 3-5x ad sets with different targeting. Leaf Co runs their best UGC across 5 different ads. This only shows they're either scaling or testing different audiences.</p> <p><strong>5. Urgency works (when done right):</strong> The Essence Vault's &quot;price hike incoming&quot; angle, Loop's &quot;discount won't wait forever,&quot; WHOOP's &quot;still time to save&quot; — urgency drives action.</p> <p>What EU/UK brands have you seen crushing it lately? Which ones did I miss?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gaistras"> /u/gaistras </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn4fb2/my_last_post_on_top_meta_advertisers_got_a_lot_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn4fb2/my_last_post_on_top_meta_advertisers_got_a_lot_of/">[comments]</a></span>
