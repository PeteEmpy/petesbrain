## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those managing Meta ad accounts how do you handle changes when something isn’t working?</p> <p>I’m relatively new to managing Meta ads for a low-budget local business, and I’m trying to find the right balance between letting things settle and making changes when performance clearly isn’t there.</p> <p>I keep seeing different advice around CBO vs ABO, number of ad sets, testing structures, etc., so I’m curious how experienced people actually handle this in practice.</p> <p>When a structure isn’t working, do you usually: Duplicate the existing campaign and adjust ad sets, budgets, or creatives? Or start a brand-new campaign from scratch?</p> <p>How long do you typically wait before deciding a structure isn’t working? And once you make a change, do you let it run properly, or are you comfortable making multiple adjustments over a short period if delivery or spend is clearly off?</p> <p>Basically trying to understand how others balance letting Meta’s algorithm settle vs moving fast when something isn’t working, especially on small daily budgets. I don't want to just keep things that are not working.</p> <p>Any insight would be really appreciated thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fearless_Schedule_83"> /u/Fearless_Schedule_83 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn5q5y/making_changes_when_something_is_not_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn5q5y/making_changes_when_something_is_not_working/">[comments]</a></span>
