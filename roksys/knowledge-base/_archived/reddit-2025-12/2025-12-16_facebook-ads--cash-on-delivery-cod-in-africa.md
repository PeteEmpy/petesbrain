# Facebook Ads + Cash on Delivery (COD) in Africa — Optimization Is Broken After Andromeda?

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’m running e-commerce campaigns in several African countries where Cash on Delivery (COD) is the only viable option due to low trust in online payments.</p> <p>Here’s how my setup works: • Facebook ads → simple order form (name, phone number, city) • Form submission is tracked as a Purchase / Order event via the Facebook pixel • Orders are then manually called for confirmation before delivery</p> <p>On paper, things look “okay”: • CPA is relatively low compared to Western markets</p> <p>But in reality: • Only 5–7% of submitted orders are actually delivered • The majority of people, when called, say: • “I was just looking for information” • “I clicked by mistake” • “I don’t remember ordering”</p> <p>Since the Andromeda update, this behavior has become much worse</p> <p>The core problem: Facebook keeps optimizing my ads based on garbage signals.</p> <p>Because: • Every form submission fires as a “Purchase” • Facebook thinks these are quality buyers • The algorithm then finds more of the same low-intent traffic • Result: lots of fake/accidental orders, high cancellation rate, and real money lost</p> <p>At this point, the pixel is being trained on people who do NOT intend to buy, and it’s killing performance. I’ve paused campaigns for now because I’m burning cash.</p> <p>My questions to the community: • Does anyone here run COD businesses (Africa, Asia, LATAM)? • How do you structure your events and optimization? • Do you optimize for leads instead of purchases? • Do you use delayed conversion signals (confirmed orders only)? • Any workaround post-Andromeda to avoid junk traffic?</p> <p>I’d really appreciate hearing real-world experiences. This model can work, but right now Facebook optimization feels completely disconnected from reality.</p> <p>Thanks in advance 🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bamougou"> /u/bamougou </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pntyj7/facebook_ads_cash_on_delivery_cod_in_africa/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pntyj7/facebook_ads_cash_on_delivery_cod_in_africa/">[comments]</a></span>
