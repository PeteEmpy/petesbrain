Actual execution.</p> <p>What you’ll find inside:</p> <ul> <li>How to define objectives that the algorithm can actually optimize for</li> <li>Modern targeting: broad + signals + Advantage+, not old-school interest stacking</li> <li>Funnel design (TOFU, MOFU, BOFU) that works with Meta’s AI instead of against it</li> <li>Creative strategy for 2026 (vertical video, testing frameworks, fatigue control)</li> <li>Pixel + CAPI setup that survives privacy changes</li> <li>Launch, monitoring, scaling, and post-launch optimization</li> <li>How to read data without lying to yourself</li> </ul> <p>The key shift?<br /> Meta Ads are no longer about “good creatives” or “clever targeting.”<br /> They’re about <strong>method, consistency, and orchestration</strong>.</p> <p>If you treat ads like experiments, you’ll get experiments.<br /> If you treat them like a system, you build assets.</p> <p>Full breakdown here 👉<br /> <a href="https://giovanniperilli.com/en/blog/meta-ads-2026-how-to-launch-effective-campaigns-step-by-step/">https://giovanniperilli.com/en/blog/meta-ads-2026-how-to-launch-effective-campaigns-step-by-step/</a></p> <p>Curious how others are adapting their Meta strategy for 2026.
