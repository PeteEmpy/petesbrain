# Problem with achieving ad spend on facebook market

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been attempting to run facebook ads every day for the last week and every campaign I attempt has only managed to spend up to a $1 on ad spend despite high budgets and CPAs. My most recent campaign I've decided instead of one ad with a high budget to create a campaign with 5 ad sets with a $10 budget each and each targeting a different audience interest only to result in $0.18 spent over 5 impressions thoughout the day. This is very frustrating as my store hasn't been able to achieve a single sale yet due to this and I'm looking for a solution to help allow my ads to be pushed. Similarly I've tried tiktok ads to only get the same result and I'd strongly appreciate if somebody could help me determine the cause of this issue. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SpecialistAttitude21"> /u/SpecialistAttitude21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnor14/problem_with_achieving_ad_spend_on_facebook_market/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnor14/problem_with_achieving_ad_spend_on_facebook_market/">[comments]</a></span>
