## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I started ecommerce, I thought I had to do super professional ads, and in the end, the more « dumb » and « ugly » I made my ads; the better it works.</p> <p>I open social media, I see brands like Brita, Dr Squatch, Ryain Air, crushing on socials and I know big brand with high end creatives sometimes are less profitable. Yes their ad manager looks great with high end photos, but in reality they aren’t really profitable </p> <p>I see a lot of brands in the beauty industry doing hooks like peeling a carrot half screen and then the other half is the founder being interviewed like are we advertising to monkeys or adults?</p> <p>Anyway I feel completely lost now. I look at my winner ads, they are dumb as f**** not proud to say « this is my brand » but also this is exactly what works. This is what gets attention, and at the end of the day I have a high quality product so it’s ok to have a dumb advertisement </p> <p>But I’m exhausted to be stuck between « a business should be professional » and then knowing that the more stupid and clickbait i make an ad, the better it works </p> <p>Have you ever felt like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucky_Candidate_7123"> /u/Lucky_Candidate_7123 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnda65/tired_of_doing_stupid_ads/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnda65/tired_of_doing_stupid_ads/">[comments]</a></span>
