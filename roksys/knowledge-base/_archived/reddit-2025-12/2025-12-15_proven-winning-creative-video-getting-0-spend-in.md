## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I recently ran a testing phase where I tested several different assets individually. The clear winner was a Video (best CTR, CPC, and CPA). I moved my 3 best assets (1 Video, 2 Images) from the testing campaign into a new scaling setup (Purchase objective).</p> <p>It’s been 2 days, and Meta has decided not to show the winning video at all. The spend started very low and has now dropped to zero. instead, the budget is being dumped into the other two assets (static images), which performed worse in the testing phase.</p> <p>My question:</p> <p>Is there a way to force the Ad Set to re-evaluate the creatives without completely killing the campaign's current momentum? Should I separate the video into its own Ad Set, or just turn off the other ads temporarily?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Firm_Accountant_578"> /u/Firm_Accountant_578 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn4ibw/proven_winning_creative_video_getting_0_spend_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn4ibw/proven_winning_creative_video_getting_0_spend_in/">[comments]</a></span>
