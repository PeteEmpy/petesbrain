## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, everyone!</p> <p>We have launched a new app with premium video content available by subscription. So far, we have almost no installs or purchases. We are uncertain about which strategy to use at the start. Essentially, there are two options. </p> <ol> <li><p>Many recommend first launching a campaign with the goal of getting installs. And when a few higher-level events appear (checkouts, for example), switch to them. And then — following the same pattern — to Purchases. The reason: if Meta doesn't see enough “signals,” it defaults to optimizing for cheap clicks, which is pointless. </p></li> <li><p>Launch a campaign for purchases right away. This will allow the algorithm to learn faster and search for a “high-quality audience.”</p></li> </ol> <p>To be honest, we are confused. How would you recommend starting?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pohyurt"> /u/Pohyurt </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnacwe/meta_ads_for_app_promo_installs_vs_purchases/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnacwe/meta_ads_for_app_promo_installs_vs_purchases/">[comments]</a></span>
