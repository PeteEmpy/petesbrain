## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Should be a fairly straightforward question. We have a campaign with one ad set with 2 ads in it. We were advised to put a reel in there so that the alg would have options, but ALL of the money is going to that ad, so we're going to delete it so meta will use our carousel. </p> <p>The question is: Will doing this have any negative effects on the other ad in the campaign. Like, will the budget reallocate smoothly? The other option is deleting the whole campaign and starting over, which is possible but time consuming. These ads are for events in 4-5 days.</p> <p>Thanks for any insight and I'm happy to answer questions for clarity</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SadQsSadAs"> /u/SadQsSadAs </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnp225/will_deleting_an_ad_have_negative_impacts_on_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pnp225/will_deleting_an_ad_have_negative_impacts_on_my/">[comments]</a></span>
