## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I run DTC creative testing and I kept getting “winners” that looked great for a few hours… then died the next day.</p> <p>The fix wasn’t a new audience or another ASC hack.<br /> It was switching from “ROAS vibes” to a <strong>spend-gated decision rule</strong>:</p> <p><strong>0–20% of daily spend → only judge attention</strong></p> <ul> <li>CTR / CPC tell you if the hook + concept is worth more spend</li> <li>If CTR is weak early, I don’t wait for ROAS to “save it”</li> </ul> <p><strong>20–50% → judge intent signals</strong></p> <ul> <li>ATC rate / ATC cost tells you if the message is creating buying intent</li> <li>If intent is weak, I iterate the concept or restructure the creative (not just change the CTA)</li> </ul> <p><strong>50%+ → only then ROAS is worth listening to</strong></p> <ul> <li>If ROAS is below BE, I don’t auto-kill — I check <strong>trend consistency (24–48h)</strong></li> <li>A spike is not a winner. Consistency is.</li> </ul> <p>This simple structure reduced wasted spend a lot because it stopped me from scaling noise.</p> <p>If anyone wants the free decision tree + checklist, comment <strong>“tree”</strong> and I’ll share it in the way that’s allowed by this sub’s rules.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate-Big-388"> /u/Affectionate-Big-388 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn0wki/how_i_stopped_scaling_fake_winners_on_meta_dtc_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1pn0wki/how_i_stopped_scaling_fake_winners_on_meta_dtc_a/">[comments]</a></span>
