## 💰 Meta signs $3B AI cloud agreement with Nebius

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

AI cloud provider **Nebius has signed a $3B**,** five-year agreement with Meta to supply AI infrastructure**. The company reported a 355% surge in quarterly revenue to $146.1M but posted a $100M loss as capital spending climbed to nearly $1B.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* Nebius’ **market value has quadrupled** **this year to $27.6B**, driven by demand for high-performance computing to train and deploy AI models.

* The Meta agreement follows Nebius’ **$17.4B contract with Microsoft in September**, marking its second major hyperscaler partnership within two months.

* Nebius said demand was so strong that the contract size had to be **capped by its available GPU capacity**, underscoring global shortages in AI compute supply.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

The agreement positions Nebius as a growing supplier to hyperscalers, intensifying competition for GPU usage and accelerating the rise of **specialized “neocloud” providers that can scale AI workloads faster** than traditional cloud giants.

## Unknown number calling? It’s not random…

The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking. One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. 

The disturbing truth? 

Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. They buy your data from brokers. Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. It’s phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. 

That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and continue to erase data as new risks appear.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI boosted productivity across Repsol’s workforce

* Repsol, a global energy company, **wanted to reduce the time spent on administrative tasks **like summarizing content and managing emails, because productivity was suffering.

* These **repetitive tasks consumed hours weekly and suspended creativity**, making it difficult for teams to maintain efficiency across departments.

* Partnering with Microsoft, Repsol deployed Microsoft 365 Copilot to **automate summaries, presentations, and data analysis across a 550-employee pilot program.**

* The pilot delivered a **16.2% improvement in output quality** **and saved 121 minutes weekly per employee**, prompting expansion to 25,000 staff.
