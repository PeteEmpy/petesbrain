## Anthropic commits $50B to US AI infrastructure

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

**Anthropic announced a $50B buildout of American computing infrastructure**, partnering with Fluidstack to build custom data centers in Texas and NY, with more sites planned. The facilities are designed specifically for Anthropic's AI workloads and will support continued research at the frontier of AI development.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The project will create approximately **800 permanent jobs and 2,400 construction jobs**, with sites coming online throughout 2026, directly supporting the Trump administration's AI Plan for domestic AI leadership.

* **Anthropic serves more than 300,000 business customers**, with some (over $100K annual revenue each) growing nearly sevenfold in the past year, driving demand for expanded infrastructure capacity.

* **The partnership with Fluidstack was chosen for rapid delivery of gigawatts of power**, enabling Anthropic to scale its Claude AI system while maintaining effective, capital-efficient operations.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This massive infrastructure commitment signals **intense competition for compute resources** as AI companies race to scale their operations. For enterprise leaders, Anthropic's capacity expansion suggests the company is **positioning Claude as a major rival to OpenAI's dominance**, with implications for enterprise AI procurement strategies and supplier diversification plans.

**AI News Story **

## German court rules ChatGPT breached copyright law

* A Munich regional court has ruled that **OpenAI’s ChatGPT violated German copyright law by training on protected song lyrics**, siding with the music rights group GEMA in a case seen as Europe’s first major AI copyright judgment.

* The court ordered OpenAI to pay** damages for using lyrics from nine popular German songs without permission**, rejecting the company’s argument that users, not the model operator, should bear responsibility for outputs.

* GEMA called the decision a **landmark for creators that could reshape how AI firms handle creative data across Europe**, while OpenAI said it disagrees with the verdict and is considering an appeal.

**AI News Story **

———————————————————————————

## Google sued over Gemini privacy violations

* Google faces a proposed class-action lawsuit claiming its AI assistant **Gemini was secretly activated** across Gmail, Google Chat, and Meet without user consent. The suit alleges Google turned on Gemini by default in October, giving the AI abilities to users' entire communication history.

* The California filing argues this violates the state's 1967 Invasion of Privacy Law, which requires consent for recording confidential conversations. Plaintiffs claim **users must navigate buried privacy settings** to opt out.

* This adds to Google's privacy controversies: the $400M settlement over location tracking and the Google+ data exposure affecting 500,000 users. **The case may define how decades-old privacy laws apply to AI systems** accessing enterprise communications.
