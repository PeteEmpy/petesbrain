## Summary

- Salesforce emphasizes that AI agents must achieve near-perfect accuracy because 5% failure rates lead to customer disappointment and eroded trust
- Customer-centric product development requires starting with customer needs rather than technology capabilities, with customer success stories as the most credible marketing
- Enterprise AI effectiveness depends on grounding models in quality data - both structured customer/product data and unstructured policy/brand information
- Trust encompasses security, performance, availability, and standing behind promises - it's Salesforce's #1 value and critical for AI agent deployment
- The evolution from sales engineering to marketing leadership demonstrates the importance of bridging technical implementation with customer communication

## Key Insights

- The '95% accuracy problem': In customer service AI, 95% accuracy means 5% of customers have negative experiences, which is unacceptable for maintaining trust and brand reputation
- Enterprise AI differentiation: Unlike consumer AI where models can be trained once, enterprise AI requires grounding in company-specific structured and unstructured data to be useful
- Customer success as marketing foundation: In B2B tech where 'large portions of the industry have lied to customers for 50 years,' third-party validation through customer stories is more credible than company claims
- Working backwards methodology: Both Amazon and Salesforce share a culture of starting with customer needs and working backwards to solutions, rather than starting with technology and seeking applications
- The trust equation in AI: Trust must cover multiple dimensions - will the AI do what it's asked, follow brand guidelines, avoid unwanted actions, and maintain security/performance standards

### Transcript

Large portions of the industry have lied to customers about what their products do for like 50 years. We wanted to bridge the divide between sales and marketing. >> How do you have that come out in your everyday life? How do you have that come out in your conversations? >> Amazon and Salesforce in terms of being very customer obsessed and taking that approach of not starting with here's a cool technology. How can we go and sell it? It's starting with the customer and their needs and working backwards and saying how can we make something that will truly delight them. It's not us talking about a hypothetical or making up a demo. It's the customers explaining our marketing message for us. >> What exactly is trust? What does that mean? >> Trust is our number one value here at Salesforce. >> Where does that come into the conversation of agents? If you make a customer service agent that's 95% accurate, it's not good enough because those 5% when they're wrong, those customers, you're going to disappoint them. Will it do the things it's being asked? Will it follow your brand and your personality? Will it not do the things that you never wanted to do? >> Ariel, a pleasure. Thank you for joining me. >> Thanks for having me here and thank you for coming to Dreamforce. >> I appreciate it. Um, I want to start off with your backgrounds. >> Sure. >> So, from what I can see from your LinkedIn profile, you started off as a data warehouse implementation consultant, a micro strategy, now the largest Bitcoin treasury company. Same sales and implementation, right? Yep. >> technical backgrounds and then you immediately move into your next venture, Ventaso as a CMO. Talk to me about that transition. Was that out of necessity or was that out of interest? >> Um well, it's a little bit of a journey there where um I was a sales engineer at Micro Strategy and a lot of that was we were building lots of demos and helping our sales people sell. This will kind of come into AI agents a little bit later, but >> um >> you know, someone would have a sales call and they're like, I need a a custom presentation, a white paper, respond to this proposal, and we'd help them out a lot. So me and my friend then decided to >> quit and start a company that would automate what we were doing manually often a lot of the the >> and so for so I was mostly doing product management. They were kind of designing the initial product and I shifted into marketing at some point. But yeah, we wanted to bridge the divide between sales and marketing. You know, it's something everyone's still working on. But it turned out there was no generative AI then. Would have been very useful for what we were trying to do. We did a lot of crazy stuff like turning um Microsoft Office into a server application to build uh datadriven documents. That was fun. >> Interesting. I mean, I'd love looking at your background of all the kind of jobs you've worked with. And one that really stuck out to me when we're talking about marketing as I'd love for you to explain this for me. Talk to me about how Andy Jassine asking, "Have you talked to any of the customers helped inform how you approach marketing?" >> Well, yeah. I mean, in my time uh at uh Amazon, uh it was really um it's just funny. They're very culturally line Amazon and Salesforce in terms of being very customer obsessed and taking that approach of not starting with here's a cool technology how can we go and sell it. It's starting with the customer and their needs and working backwards and saying how can we make something that will truly delight them and will be different from uh other alternatives out there. And it sounds it sounds simple but it sounds obvious but you'd be surprised at how it doesn't really always work like that. in many companies >> has that always been the case cuz I think about marketing now compared to marketing 10 years ago compared to what well be in the future the thing that stays the same is that just always being customercentric and then the technology of how you provide that changes >> uh I think in some ways when you think about like for let's say B2B technology marketing there's lots of technology it's super complicated at the end of the day like what you need to do is to explain to customers what it is how it works why it's different and then to inspire them uh uh with use cases and then most importantly as the foundation below everything is customer success as a proof point and it's like there you know you got to have in the back of your mind in tech marketing that large portions of the industry have lied to customers about what their products do for like 50 years right so everyone's skeptical and there's no better marketing you can do than to have the customer explain why your product's great and why it's making an impact for them. So that's why I've always tried to focus on customer success. And if you look, I don't know if you had a chance to go to our expo, this agent force city, AI agents are new. People are like, what am I going to do with them? What's the impact? We're like, okay, let's take 17 of our customers that have been successful with Agent Force. Let's build a little mini city. They can see like FedEx, Pandora, the jewelry company, Lululemon, Equinox, on and on and on. And they can see how they're using Agent Force. So, it's not us talking about a hypothetical or making up a demo. It's the customers explaining our marketing message for us. Now, it only works if you have good products that work and if you treat your customers well and help them become successful. >> Yeah, I want to double tap into that. So, into the delivery of that customer success, what goes into it? When I was looking at your LinkedIn profile, it says, "As president and CMO at Salesforce, I'm building and leading a team of global marketers focused on educating customers about how to leverage the power of CRM, AI, data, and trust. Talk to me about the synergy between those four and why that works for success." Well, um I we talked a little bit about trust with, you know, it's that it's a really great word because it it just embodies so many of the things that are important when you're running uh a software company, a SAS company, any kind of a cloud company where you have to trust the security, you have to trust the performance, the availability, you have to trust the people in that company. They're going to stand behind their promises and they're going to help you be successful. So, that's really at the heart of everything that we do. We always say trust is our number one value here at Salesforce. Um, and CRM is kind of the space that we're playing in of we're in the world of helping our customers with their customer experience, sales, marketing, support, commerce, uh, and how people are delivering CRM now is completely evolving and changing and and morphing with AI and AI agents. >> And one of the things that we've learned and I think a lot of other people learn too is your AI is only as good as your data. I mean that's the biggest difference between consumer AI and enterprise AI. You can have a model trained once for consumers and it can do a lot of useful things. Um none of these LLMs can do very useful things in the enterprise without being able to ground it in the data. both the structured data um about who your customers are, what products they've bought, what problems they have, where they're located, and also the unstructured data, which is how you want to talk to them, and all the rules and all the information about your products um and your policies. So, you got to be able to have that together. And that's we just spent a lot of time trying to make it easier for our customers to ground their AI and trusted data which which is really the most important thing for being successful with AI. I want to tap into you as an individual. You're mentioning a lot about trust. How do you operate uh from a place of trust? You're obviously in a very important position, president, CMO. Like how do you have that come out in your everyday life? How do you have that come out in your conversations? I I mean the first thing that comes to my mind um is transparency and I think both with teams and being really clear about why we're doing things um but you know I sort of have a rule in my team that you if someone asks you why you can't say it's well Ariel said do it. >> It sounds simple but but uh you know I got to stamp that out. But more importantly I think transparency really comes to play in resource allocation. You know, it doesn't matter how big your company is, there's going to be a lot of demands on marketing because here's the problem for marketers. More is always better, right? Yeah. Everyone wants more. And if you're in a company with multiple products, multiple geographies, there's going to be resource contention. And you can't have logical conversations with people about what are the right allocations resources. Unless you invest in having systems to provide transparency to what you're actually doing. So, if you're a product leader, I want to be able to go to you and say, "Uh, here's the budget that we're spending directly 100% on only your products, and here's the stuff that covers all of our products, maybe the brand." And then you have the baseline to have a fact-based conversation. >> Yeah. Where does that come into the conversation of agents? We work directly with agents ourselves and we have a lot of customers that work with agents and I think there's still some cognitive dissonance there with people actually trusting agents. How are you finding the process of that of introducing agents to customers and trying to build up? >> Yes. Well, you know, look, it's still relatively early. It was only a year ago we launched agent force and you know, just a little bit over a year and people really were talking about agents. So, um, we have to build that trust. You know, if you're a company who's going to deploy an agent on your website, you're putting a lot of trust in that to have these conversations. And and this is some of the things we've learned as an industry that if you make, let's say, a customer service agent that's going to be 95% accurate. >> Yeah. >> Well, it's not good enough because those 5% when they're wrong, um those customers, you're going to disappoint them. You're not going to solve their problems. You may in some cases in regulated industries um break the law. M >> so this is where like there's lots of startups they'll have really cool demos but the difference between a cool demo and something that a a large enterprise can roll out in production and trust to interact directly with their customers I mean that's the work that our engineers um have been doing and collaborating with our customers to iterate on how to make AI enterprise ready um for all these customerf facing use cases. I just want to finish off this segment to kind of understand more from your perspective if we're using first principles thinking. What exactly is trust? What does that mean? Well, it it depends on the context, but I think we talk about AI agents. It's that you're going to trust that it's going to uh have utilitarian effectiveness. Like, will it do the things that um that are it's being asked? Um, will it follow your brand and your personality and you know the things people like about your brand? Will it not do the things that you find abhorrent about brand that you never wanted to do? How do you you know there's two sides of it, right? You want to do the things that we love. You want to not do the things that we say we don't do. Um, and then of course it has to be secure. And this is one of these areas where at Salesforce people have been trusting us with their most important data, their customer data for over 26 years. So that's just hardwired into the DNA of everyone in the company to make sure that that aspect you never get wrong. Um, and I think also there's the people side of the trust too. Like you know this is new technology. We got to help our customers. We got to pick up the phone. We got to make sure they're successful. I want to talk about training and culture. And I think something to frame it, something I like to understand is the two titles, president and CMO. How do they work together? Why why both of them? >> I wouldn't pay too much attention to that. I mean, I just think myself is I'm the guy that runs marketing. >> Yeah. >> And there's a set of things that uh the company needs out of the marketing team and it's my job to help make sure we do that well. Yeah. >> You think about >> um >> building our brand and generating demand for our sales teams and then educating customers through our mass channels like our website. at the end of the day with the technology like first thing you got to do is make sure you're clearly explaining what your products do, how they work, and why it matters. >> Yeah. I just the way I was looking at it, I thought that there was because of those two roles you're occupying, it's making that translation easier because you're undertaking kind of two roles as that. >> That's one role on the marketing too. When we're thinking about how you train your staff to use AI and get comfortable with it, I'm kind of curious to your personal contributions to this. Yeah, you've obviously worked in the startup world. You've worked across multiple organizations. >> What have you kind of brought to the team in terms of how to get people comfortable with the interesting because I would say maybe it's not training, it's more inspiration. Okay. because I find that um a lot of the really exciting use cases for AI on my team are not because we trained someone. It's because someone was intellectually curious and had a strong sense of ownership about wanting to deliver a better result. So, we have some people in our creative team that are building videos that are, let's say, 50% live shot, 50% uh AI content, and they're experimenting with all of these tools and they're going out doing the research. There's new tools every day, right? It would be easy for some people to go, I'm just going to do the same thing I did for the last video. Rinse and repeat. There's other people who are just constantly excited and motivated by new things. It's sort of this like eagerness for change. This is what I think is funny. It's almost like cultivating the right personality of intellectual curiosity. It's more important than technical skills because these tools actually like they want to talk to you in English, right? Yeah. >> And so that's part of it. And um you know but of course uh we are also you know using AI in more sort of scientific rigorous ways like you know we think about predictive AI for things like measurement attribution models lead scoring. >> Yeah. >> So it it sort of runs the whole gamut >> with that intellectual curiosity. You're obviously looking for like a a certain personality type. I'm wondering if I can kind of put you on the spot. >> Yeah. If you were interviewing me for a position at Salesforce to work directly under you, what would you ask me to try or uncover that? >> I would say a well uh intellectual so just some of the characteristics I care the most about intellectual curiosity, attention to detail, um uh lack of narcissistic uh personality disorders. Uh like that one's the easiest. Usually ask people, well, tell me about uh a really big mistake that you made uh and what you learned from it. And it can't be that they didn't give you enough budget or didn't listen to you. Yeah. >> And you'd be surprised. A lot of people they can't um uh they can't answer that. Or for intellectual curiosity, I'd say like, you know, tell me um what's the newest um you know, personal or business technology that you've discovered that you're most excited about? And you could see how some people like they're they light up when they talk about it. Other people, you know, don't. And it sort of it it it shows uh their eagerness for change. And and you like it or not, we're in a world where things change. We're not in a world anymore where as marketers, we can do the same thing over and over again and say, "Well, 2 or 3% incremental efficiency every year is good enough cuz you're going to be left behind. There's just so much new technology." And a lot of people, they're really excited by that. There are some people that aren't so excited by that. Maybe it's not the right, you know, profession anymore. >> Yeah. It's interesting. I had a conversation with Ryan Gavin yesterday. He's more Slack. Um and he had a sort of similar answer when I was kind of talking about this with him that lack of ego that you're mentioning. >> Yeah. >> He mentioned something in a similar parallel where what he looks for when he's hiring someone is not like the roles that they occupied but it's the changes that they made in the companies. >> He's looking for the actual cause and effect rather than the ego tied to what title they have. >> Yeah. Yeah. Totally change. But also like it's interrelated a little bit because you are going to be it's easy to say I want this group to change but we want people that are constantly evaluating what their own teams are doing and saying you know what this isn't working anymore I want to change it and if you believe that a business process your team does is somehow attached to you and your self-worth. And if we say we're not going to do this anymore, that it means I'm not as worthy or I I'm less of a person cuz I was wrong. Like, forget it. Like, we want people that love looking inward, finding ways to go better, and that that failure at something is a gift because you can learn from it. Um, just one of these quotes from uh uh Jeff Bezos that sort of sticks with me. He said that failure is the inseparable twin sister of innovation. >> Wow. And you know that you know of course you want to experiment a lot and you know fail quickly and then take those learnings and iterate on them and but but you have to have that different mindset of looking at your mistakes and not saying why did you do this I can't believe it go okay well what were our assumptions that we took into this that turned out not to be true >> or were all of our assumptions right but we're missing a tool or all of our assumptions right the tools right but maybe we don't have the right people. So, it's those are the the conversations we have on the team that are most exciting and fun for me. >> Yeah. >> But if you make everyone too afraid to fail, then you're just going to play it safe. >> Let me talk about you as a leader. So, out of my conversations with Nancy Hugh, with Ryan Gavin, and other people on the team, the I'll describe this kind of like top down leadership as well. Like you guys are kind of using AI in a daily basis. You're practic yourself. Talk to me about your AI use. Like, what does your day-to-day look like? Um there's a couple ways. Um one of the things I've been doing a lot is um you know there's a lot of data to keep up with. You can think about all the different campaigns and programs we run. >> Yeah. >> Uh and um all the different cuts of geography and um product that someone may have a question about. So I tend to have the latest um set of reports all in Notebook LM that I can go ask questions uh with Gemini. that ends up being grading. I use uh chat GPT all the time um to basically test often test messaging some if I'm going to prepare for you know some like we did this uh uh uh we had a a CMO event here we had 40 CMOs and we had topics to talk about and I said well um here's my answer to this question what are four other takes I could have taken and you know some of them were pretty silly some of them were like oh I had thought about that way so it's Um um you know that's th those are two aspects. Trying to think what else. Um I am not good with all the graphic creative design stuff. Um but there's people on my team there's a living that all the time and they love it. >> Yeah. >> And then of course you know I I'm interacting with Agent Force all the time. I love going on our website and uh pretending to be a customer and asking questions and making sure that it's going to give the right answers. Doesn't give the right answers. is I go back to the product marketing teams and um you know we we evolve the content. >> Yeah. I mean it's incredibly obvious how engaged all of your leadership team actually is with the product, how much you use it yourself. It's been something that's consistent across all the conversations I've had. >> I want to finish off with two questions. Firstly, you hypothetically you're 21 again, just graduated college. You're coming into your first job at Salesforce. What role would you want? What department would you want it to be in and why? >> That's a really good question. Uh, I mean, I could think of a lot of different um, >> well, I guess a lot of different well, the objective here is to achieve as much success as possible. >> Listen, I I mean, I've had the most fun. It's fun. I had the most fun in my life doing product marketing. >> Okay. >> Um, and actually, that was the first job I did at Salesforce. I was a product marketer for our our developer functionality. And so nothing I love more than sitting with an engineer just built something and say let tell me about what your product does. Show me a demo. Let's, you know, dig in and really understand deeply what it does and then have that conversation about use cases, benefits. Um, and calling up customers, hey, you use this. What did you think? Oh, I hadn't thought of that. Why do you like it? Why is it different than what? And then just taking all that, synthesizing that into into product marketing messaging. I love that. you know, it's I think it's fun to do, but also the more you can get experience with different parts of technology, you know, that gives you ideas for new things that you can do. >> Yeah. I have one last question. I pose this to all of my guests. Um, and you can take it however you want it. Um, people take it in different ways. Some people go more personal, some people make it job related. So, just take it however you want it. And I'd encourage you to take 5 10 seconds before answering. Why do you do what you do? false. >> Yeah. You know, sometimes the best questions are the simple ones. Um, so I love working in technology and um, the reason I like marketing in technology is because you have so much complexity that is inextricably tied to the most exciting technology. The more exciting is, the more complexity there is. And if you can't explain it to people in the right way, you can't get people to understand it, the technology will not be successful. And so in you know, it's that combination of it's something I think is useful and it's something I find enjoyable as a part of business to think through and figure out what's the right way and iterate until you get something that's good. >> Beautiful. Thank you so much, R. Hey, man. I appreciate it. >> Thank you. Appreciate it.
