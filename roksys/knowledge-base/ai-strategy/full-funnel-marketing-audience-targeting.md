## Transcript

As the world shifts and as people go more to AI mode, go more to chat GPT, you really have to build that connection to your brand much higher up in the funnel. You can't just wait until that last minute. So demand genen plays in that, right? Because somebody's not necessarily searching for your thing, but we're exposing them to what your business offers, your value proposition. So how how do you like dimension? Do you have some tips and tricks on that one? Yeah, I mean I think getting really specific about the audiences like what might someone have searched for um where it would have made sense for you to show up and maybe it was cost prohibitive, you know, what might they be in market for? Thinking, you know, putting together a lot of those those segments and then being able to come up with ads that speak specifically to them, I think can be a really rich way to reach people earlier in the funnel. it's not going to convert at the exact same rate, but it also is a nice way to kind of like, you know, for years I said that Google Ads was the the best way to put your best offer in front of your ideal audience at the time they're most ready to take action. And I think for years that was true. I think that's less of Google's main service offering now is like that premium moment like right before they're ready. And like it's it's a lot more fullfunnel and we can take advantage of that by u using you know Google's knowledge of its audience which is hugely expansive to to try to reach people not necessarily in the right moments but the right people with the right message and kind of start to reach people earlier in the customer journey. Okay.
