## Summary

- Microsoft launched App Builder and Workflows features for Copilot, enabling 100M+ Microsoft 365 users to build applications and automate workflows using natural language prompts without coding
- All three new capabilities (App Builder, Workflows, and simplified Copilot Studio) are included in the existing $30/month Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription at no additional cost
- Tools leverage Microsoft's 9-year Power Platform investment (56M monthly active users) and integrate directly into Copilot's conversational interface with built-in security and governance
- Apps are full-stack applications with databases (Microsoft Lists), security controls, and automatic integration with Microsoft 365 ecosystem (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, Planner)
- Represents Microsoft's aggressive push to democratize software development and merge AI with business productivity tools, positioning every office worker as a potential app/workflow creator

## Key Insights

- Democratization of development: Microsoft is betting that AI-assisted no-code tools will fundamentally change job roles, making app/workflow creation a standard part of knowledge work rather than a specialized IT function
- Context advantage: Copilot's integration with Microsoft 365 data provides significant competitive advantage over standalone low-code platforms, as it can understand organizational context and suggest relevant features based on existing communications
- Pricing strategy: Including these capabilities in existing subscription pricing ($30/month) rather than charging additional fees signals Microsoft's commitment to widespread adoption and potentially disrupting the low-code platform market
- Enterprise-ready by design: Built-in governance, security, and data loss prevention policies address typical enterprise concerns about citizen development and shadow IT
- Professional developer role evolution: While democratizing development, Microsoft acknowledges professional developers still needed for complex applications, governance, and optimization - suggesting a shift toward developer-citizen collaboration models

## Summary

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"><u>Microsoft</u></a> is launching a significant expansion of its <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/"><u>Copilot AI assistant</u></a> on Tuesday, introducing tools that let employees build applications, automate workflows, and create specialized AI agents using only conversational prompts — no coding required.</p><p>The new capabilities, called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/10/28/microsoft-365-copilot-now-enables-you-to-build-apps-and-workflows/"><u>App Builder</u></a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/10/28/microsoft-365-copilot-now-enables-you-to-build-apps-and-workflows/"><u>Workflows</u></a>, mark Microsoft&#x27;s most aggressive attempt yet to merge artificial intelligence with software development, enabling the estimated <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html"><u>100 million Microsoft 365 users</u></a> to create business tools as easily as they currently draft emails or build spreadsheets.</p><p>&quot;We really believe that a main part of an AI-forward employee, not just developers, will be to create agents, workflows and apps,&quot; Charles Lamanna, Microsoft&#x27;s president of business and industry Copilot, said in an interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Part of the job will be to build and create these things.&quot;</p><p>The announcement comes as Microsoft deepens its commitment to AI-powered productivity tools while navigating a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/"><u>complex partnership with OpenAI</u></a>, the creator of the underlying technology that powers Copilot. On the same day, OpenAI completed its restructuring into a for-profit entity, with Microsoft receiving a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/microsoft-to-get-27-of-openai-access-to-ai-models-until-2032"><u>27% ownership stake</u></a> valued at approximately $135 billion.</p><h2><b>How natural language prompts now create fully functional business applications</b></h2><p>The new features transform <a href="http://copilot.microsoft.com/"><u>Copilot</u></a> from a conversational assistant into what Microsoft envisions as a comprehensive development environment accessible to non-technical workers. Users can now describe an application they need — such as a project tracker with dashboards and task assignments — and Copilot will generate a working app complete with a database backend, user interface, and security controls.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re right inside of Copilot, you can now have a conversation to build an application complete with a backing database and a security model,&quot; Lamanna explained. &quot;You can make edit requests and update requests and change requests so you can tune the app to get exactly the experience you want before you share it with other users.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps"><u>App Builder</u></a> stores data in Microsoft Lists, the company&#x27;s lightweight database system, and allows users to share finished applications via a simple link—similar to sharing a document. The Workflows agent, meanwhile, automates routine tasks across Microsoft&#x27;s ecosystem of products, including Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, and Planner, by converting natural language descriptions into automated processes.</p><p>A third component, a simplified version of <a href="http://microsoft.com/en/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio"><u>Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot Studio</u></a> agent-building platform, lets users create specialized AI assistants tailored to specific tasks or knowledge domains, drawing from SharePoint documents, meeting transcripts, emails, and external systems.</p><p>All three capabilities are included in the existing $30-per-month <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/pricing"><u>Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription</u></a> at no additional cost — a pricing decision Lamanna characterized as consistent with Microsoft&#x27;s historical approach of bundling significant value into its productivity suite.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s what Microsoft always does. We try to do a huge amount of value at a low price,&quot; he said. &quot;If you go look at Office, you think about Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Exchange, all that for like eight bucks a month. That&#x27;s a pretty good deal.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why Microsoft&#x27;s nine-year bet on low-code development is finally paying off</b></h2><p>The new tools represent the culmination of a nine-year effort by Microsoft to democratize software development through its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform"><u>Power Platform</u></a> — a collection of low-code and no-code development tools that has grown to 56 million monthly active users, according to figures the company disclosed in recent earnings reports.</p><p>Lamanna, who has led the Power Platform initiative since its inception, said the integration into Copilot marks a fundamental shift in how these capabilities reach users. Rather than requiring workers to visit a separate website or learn a specialized interface, the development tools now exist within the same conversational window they already use for AI-assisted tasks.</p><p>&quot;One of the big things that we&#x27;re excited about is Copilot — that&#x27;s a tool for literally every office worker,&quot; Lamanna said. &quot;Every office worker, just like they research data, they analyze data, they reason over topics, they also will be creating apps, agents and workflows.&quot;</p><p>The integration offers significant technical advantages, he argued. Because Copilot already indexes a user&#x27;s Microsoft 365 content — emails, documents, meetings, and organizational data — it can incorporate that context into the applications and workflows it builds. If a user asks for &quot;an app for <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2015/03/30/introducing-project-spartan-the-new-browser-built-for-windows-10/"><u>Project Spartan</u></a>,&quot; Copilot can draw from existing communications to understand what that project entails and suggest relevant features.</p><p>&quot;If you go to those other tools, they have no idea what the heck Project Spartan is,&quot; Lamanna said, referencing competing low-code platforms from companies like Google, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. &quot;But if you do it inside of Copilot and inside of the App Builder, it&#x27;s able to draw from all that information and context.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"><u>Microsoft</u></a> claims the apps created through these tools are &quot;full-stack applications&quot; with proper databases secured through the same identity systems used across its enterprise products — distinguishing them from simpler front-end tools offered by competitors. The company also emphasized that its existing governance, security, and data loss prevention policies automatically apply to apps and workflows created through Copilot.</p><h2><b>Where professional developers still matter in an AI-powered workplace</b></h2><p>While <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"><u>Microsoft</u></a> positions the new capabilities as accessible to all office workers, Lamanna was careful to delineate where professional developers remain essential. His dividing line centers on whether a system interacts with parties outside the organization.</p><p>&quot;Anything that leaves the boundaries of your company warrants developer involvement,&quot; he said. &quot;If you want to build an agent and put it on your website, you should have developers involved. Or if you want to build an automation which interfaces directly with your customers, or an app or a website which interfaces directly with your customers, you want professionals involved.&quot;</p><p>The reasoning is risk-based: external-facing systems carry greater potential for data breaches, security vulnerabilities, or business errors. &quot;You don&#x27;t want people getting refunds they shouldn&#x27;t,&quot; Lamanna noted.</p><p>For internal use cases — approval workflows, project tracking, team dashboards — Microsoft believes the new tools can handle the majority of needs without IT department involvement. But the company has built &quot;no cliffs,&quot; in Lamanna&#x27;s terminology, allowing users to migrate simple apps to more sophisticated platforms as needs grow.</p><p>Apps created in the conversational <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps"><u>App Builder</u></a> can be opened in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps"><u>Power Apps</u></a>, Microsoft&#x27;s full development environment, where they can be connected to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/dataverse"><u>Dataverse</u></a>, the company&#x27;s enterprise database, or extended with custom code. Similarly, simple workflows can graduate to the full <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/power-platform/products/power-automate?market=af"><u>Power Automate platform</u></a>, and basic agents can be enhanced in the complete Copilot Studio.</p><p>&quot;We have this mantra called no cliffs,&quot; Lamanna said. &quot;If your app gets too complicated for the App Builder, you can always edit and open it in Power Apps. You can jump over to the richer experience, and if you&#x27;re really sophisticated, you can even go from those experiences into Azure.&quot;</p><p>This architecture addresses a problem that has plagued previous generations of easy-to-use development tools: users who outgrow the simplified environment often must rebuild from scratch on professional platforms. &quot;People really do not like easy-to-use development tools if I have to throw everything away and start over,&quot; Lamanna said.</p><h2><b>What happens when every employee can build apps without IT approval</b></h2><p>The democratization of software development raises questions about governance, maintenance, and organizational complexity — issues Microsoft has worked to address through administrative controls.</p><p>IT administrators can view all applications, workflows, and agents created within their organization through a centralized inventory in the <a href="https://www.office.com/"><u>Microsoft 365</u></a> admin center. They can reassign ownership, disable access at the group level, or &quot;promote&quot; particularly useful employee-created apps to officially supported status.</p><p>&quot;We have a bunch of customers who have this approach where it&#x27;s like, let 1,000 apps bloom, and then the best ones, I go upgrade and make them IT-governed or central,&quot; Lamanna said.</p><p>The system also includes provisions for when employees leave. Apps and workflows remain accessible for 60 days, during which managers can claim ownership — similar to how OneDrive files are handled when someone departs.</p><p>Lamanna argued that most employee-created apps don&#x27;t warrant significant IT oversight. &quot;It&#x27;s just not worth inspecting an app that John, Susie, and Bob use to do their job,&quot; he said. &quot;It should concern itself with the app that ends up being used by 2,000 people, and that will pop up in that dashboard.&quot;</p><p>Still, the proliferation of employee-created applications could create challenges. Users have expressed frustration with Microsoft&#x27;s increasing emphasis on AI features across its products, with some giving the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2954732/users-arent-happy-with-copilot-ai-taking-over-the-microsoft-365-app.html"><u>Microsoft 365 mobile app one-star ratings</u></a> after a recent update prioritized Copilot over traditional file access.</p><p>The tools also arrive as enterprises grapple with &quot;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"><u>shadow IT</u></a>&quot; — unsanctioned software and systems that employees adopt without official approval. While Microsoft&#x27;s governance controls aim to provide visibility, the ease of creating new applications could accelerate the pace at which these systems multiply.</p><h2><b>The ambitious plan to turn 500 million workers into software builders</b></h2><p>Microsoft&#x27;s ambitions for the technology extend far beyond incremental productivity gains. Lamanna envisions a fundamental transformation of what it means to be an office worker — one where building software becomes as routine as creating spreadsheets.</p><p>&quot;Just like how 20 years ago you put on your resume that you could use pivot tables in Excel, people are going to start saying that they can use App Builder and workflow agents, even if they&#x27;re just in the finance department or the sales department,&quot; he said.</p><p>The numbers he&#x27;s targeting are staggering. With <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q3"><u>56 million people already using Power Platform</u></a>, Lamanna believes the integration into Copilot could eventually reach 500 million builders. &quot;Early days still, but I think it&#x27;s certainly encouraging,&quot; he said.</p><p>The features are currently available only to customers in Microsoft&#x27;s <a href="https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/frontier-program/"><u>Frontier Program</u></a> — an early access initiative for Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers. The company has not disclosed how many organizations participate in the program or when the tools will reach general availability.</p><p>The announcement fits within Microsoft&#x27;s larger strategy of embedding AI capabilities throughout its product portfolio, driven by its partnership with OpenAI. Under the restructured agreement announced Tuesday, Microsoft will have access to OpenAI&#x27;s technology through 2032, including models that achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) — though such systems do not yet exist. Microsoft has also begun integrating Copilot into its new companion apps for Windows 11, which provide quick access to contacts, files, and calendar information.</p><p>The aggressive integration of AI features across Microsoft&#x27;s ecosystem has drawn mixed reactions. While enterprise customers have shown interest in productivity gains, the rapid pace of change and ubiquity of AI prompts have frustrated some users who prefer traditional workflows.</p><p>For Microsoft, however, the calculation is clear: if even a fraction of its user base begins creating applications and automations, it would represent a massive expansion of the effective software development workforce — and further entrench customers in Microsoft&#x27;s ecosystem. The company is betting that the same natural language interface that made ChatGPT accessible to millions can finally unlock the decades-old promise of empowering everyday workers to build their own tools.</p><p>The App Builder and Workflows agents are available starting today through the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/agents"><u>Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store</u></a> for Frontier Program participants.</p><p>Whether that future arrives depends not just on the technology&#x27;s capabilities, but on a more fundamental question: Do millions of office workers actually want to become part-time software developers? Microsoft is about to find out if the answer is yes — or if some jobs are better left to the professionals.</p><p>
