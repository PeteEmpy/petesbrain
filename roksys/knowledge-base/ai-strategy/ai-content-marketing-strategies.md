Let's talk a little bit about AI in your agency. So, what kind of tools, what kind of technologies, use cases have you found particularly appealing to make the business more efficient? >> Well, SEO, a lot of it is content. AI is pretty good at writing content. Unfortunately, all my writers use AI. Had to let them all go except for a couple that pride themselves on not using AI. But almost all the writers I use, they just use AI and charge me full price for content when I'm like, I could just do this myself and much better because I have prompts that are like two pages long for anything that I'm putting out there because the more detailed the prompts are, the more unique that result is going to be versus somebody just might be selling dog food and says, "Hey, write me 10 blog posts about dog food." Very boring, generic, not going to move the needle. Versus saying, "Hey, here's my keyword dog food and give me 10 topics related to dog food." Then you get 10 topics. Then you pick and choose the topics that make sense. Have AI help you create outlines. Then you restructure the outlines. Make sure it all flows properly. Then if you wanted to write it for you, then at least now you have a lot more unique kind of in your own voice, in your own structure, what you want to be in that content. But then just making sure that you have big long prompts that really detail what needs to be done, how to write the content, how to structure it, the wording, the phrasing. making sure you put like natural language processing and semantic web and making sure that you put all the stuff that Google's looking for or whatever or LLMs or whatever platform that we're trying to rank for. Making sure you put all those best practices in there. And by doing that, I'm able to create content for my clients and this content I've had it rank within a week. Some of these pages get to like the first position on Google. Google doesn't care who writes the content. They said like two years ago, we don't care who writes it if it's human or AI. It just has to be accurate. AI is not accurate. It's a good starting point. So, if you just copy and paste it verbatim, it's not going to work. But editing it, tweaking it, that's why I have all these steps and have really long prompts is to make it unique and not just do what a lot of people are doing, which is saying, "Write me a hundred blogs about dog food." And they're just posting them up there. And might give you a quick boost, but in the long run, it's full of inaccuracies. It doesn't look good and Google doesn't like
