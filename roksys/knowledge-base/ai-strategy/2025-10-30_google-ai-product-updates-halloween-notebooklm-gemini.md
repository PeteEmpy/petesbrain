AI tips (and treats) for the spooky season

Halloween is almost here, and Google AI can help you properly celebrate the  
spooky season. Handle your ghastly
image needs with Nano Banana, from creating a pumpkin-themed party reminder  
and turning your selfies into
ghostly portraits, to seeing your pups in different costumes. And if you  
need last-minute costume or crafting
inspiration, Mixboard is ready to brainstorm unique costume ideas, and  
Gemini's Canvas can turn any image into
a custom pumpkin carving template. Our best AI tools are knocking at your  
door.

Happy haunting!

Beyond the news

The legendary Route 66, the iconic road that slices through the American  
heartland on its long journey from
Chicago to Santa Monica, is turning 100. To celebrate, Google has partnered  
with the National Trust for
Historic Preservation and 22 cultural organizations to create a massive new  
digital road trip: A Cultural Trip
Down Route 66. You can discover over 130 stories and 4,000 images  
highlighting the diverse communities and
iconic landmarks along "The Mother Highway" -- and even test your road  
warrior knowledge with our quiz.
