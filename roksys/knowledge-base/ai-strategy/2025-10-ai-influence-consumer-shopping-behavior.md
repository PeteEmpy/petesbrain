## Summary

- AI is increasingly influencing consumer purchase decisions, with predictive capabilities that anticipate needs before consumers articulate them
- Despite AI's growing influence, traditional search engines still maintain the dominant position in the consumer shopping journey
- AI's influence now exceeds that of social recommendations from friends, marking a significant shift in trust and decision-making factors
- The predictive nature of AI (anticipating needs) is a key differentiator driving its adoption and influence among shoppers

## Key Insights

- AI's predictive capabilities create a proactive shopping experience that traditional channels cannot match, positioning it as a trusted advisor in the purchase process
- Marketers should balance investments between AI-powered predictive tools and traditional search optimization, as both channels play complementary roles in the customer journey
- The shift from peer recommendations to AI recommendations suggests consumers value convenience and personalization over social proof in certain shopping contexts
- Brands need to optimize for AI discovery and recommendations while maintaining strong search presence to capture demand across both emerging and established channels
