## Summary

- Enterprise AI assistants and LLMs create expanded cybersecurity attack surfaces through features like live web browsing, user context memory, and business app integrations
- Tenable researchers identified critical vulnerabilities grouped under 'HackedGPT', demonstrating how AI productivity tools can be exploited
- Organizations face pressure from boards to implement AI for productivity gains while simultaneously managing new security risks
- The same capabilities that make AI assistants useful for business operations also create vulnerabilities that threat actors can exploit

## Key Insights

- AI adoption requires balancing productivity benefits against security risks - organizations must implement security frameworks before widespread deployment
- Features like web browsing, memory persistence, and API integrations in AI assistants significantly expand the traditional attack surface beyond conventional security perimeters
- The HackedGPT research demonstrates that AI tools can be exploited by attackers, requiring new security protocols and governance structures
- Marketing and operational teams implementing AI tools must coordinate with IT security to establish proper guardrails and monitoring systems
- Risk assessment frameworks should be updated to include AI-specific vulnerabilities when evaluating new tool adoption
