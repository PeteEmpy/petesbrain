## Summary

- Data readiness is a critical prerequisite for effective AI-powered marketing, yet often overlooked in favor of jumping directly to AI tools
- Building a curated data pipeline (rather than a data firehose) is essential for strengthening trust in AI systems and improving output quality
- Proper data infrastructure directly impacts prompt engineering effectiveness and the quality of AI-driven marketing decisions
- Organizations must prioritize data preparation, cleaning, and governance before expecting meaningful results from AI marketing initiatives

## Key Insights

- The quality of AI marketing outputs is fundamentally limited by the quality and readiness of underlying data - garbage in, garbage out principle applies at scale
- A curated, well-structured data pipeline enables better prompt engineering and more reliable AI decisions compared to overwhelming AI systems with raw, unfiltered data
- Building data readiness infrastructure should precede AI implementation to avoid wasted resources and failed AI initiatives
- Trust in AI-powered marketing systems depends heavily on having clean, validated, and properly structured data sources
