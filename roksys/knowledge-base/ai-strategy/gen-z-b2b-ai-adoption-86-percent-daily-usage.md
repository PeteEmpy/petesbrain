## Summary

- 86% of Gen Z professionals use AI tools daily in B2B buying processes, leading all demographic groups
- AI tools have become central to B2B purchasing decisions, marking a fundamental shift in buyer behavior
- TrustRadius report confirms the B2B market has entered the 'generative era' of AI-enabled purchasing
- Marketers must urgently adapt strategies to reach and engage AI-enabled buyers
- Generational gap in AI adoption suggests different approaches needed for different buyer personas

## Key Insights

- Gen Z's 86% daily AI usage rate represents the highest adoption among all professional demographics, signaling a permanent shift in how younger buyers research and evaluate B2B solutions
- B2B marketers must redesign content strategy to be AI-discoverable and AI-consumable, as traditional buyer journey models no longer reflect how AI-enabled buyers make decisions
- The generational divide in AI adoption requires segmented marketing approaches - what works for Gen Z buyers won't necessarily resonate with older decision-makers who use AI less frequently
- Companies that fail to optimize their digital presence for AI-assisted research risk becoming invisible to the fastest-growing segment of B2B buyers
- Marketing teams should prioritize creating structured, authoritative content that AI tools can easily parse and recommend during buyer research phases
