## Summary

- Part 2 of a series on evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline performance using order-aware metrics
- Focuses on Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Average Precision (AP) as binary, order-aware evaluation measures
- These metrics assess how well RAG systems retrieve relevant documents and rank them appropriately
- Critical for optimizing AI-powered marketing tools like chatbots, content generators, and customer service automation
- Provides technical framework for measuring retrieval quality beyond basic accuracy metrics

## Key Insights

- Order-aware metrics like MRR and AP are essential for evaluating RAG systems where document ranking matters, not just retrieval accuracy
- Understanding retrieval quality metrics enables better optimization of AI marketing tools that depend on accurate information retrieval
- Binary evaluation measures help identify when RAG systems are surfacing relevant content in the right priority order
- These evaluation frameworks are foundational for building reliable AI-powered customer interactions and content generation systems
