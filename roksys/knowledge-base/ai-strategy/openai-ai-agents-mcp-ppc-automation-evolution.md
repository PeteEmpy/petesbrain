## Summary

- OpenAI introduces AI agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) that bridge AI reasoning with real-world actions, moving beyond traditional scripts
- AI agents can autonomously execute complex PPC workflows by connecting to multiple systems and making decisions based on context
- MCPs enable standardized connections between AI models and external tools/data sources, creating more robust automation frameworks
- This represents a shift from rule-based automation to reasoning-based automation that can adapt to changing conditions
- PPC practitioners can leverage these tools to automate complex, multi-step workflows that previously required manual intervention

## Key Insights

- The transition from scripts to agents represents a fundamental shift in automation capabilities - from following predefined rules to making contextual decisions across complex workflows
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardization could solve the integration challenges that have limited AI automation adoption in PPC management
- Early adopters who understand how to orchestrate AI agents with existing PPC platforms will gain significant efficiency advantages in campaign management
- This technology enables automation of strategic tasks (analysis, optimization recommendations, cross-platform coordination) rather than just tactical execution
