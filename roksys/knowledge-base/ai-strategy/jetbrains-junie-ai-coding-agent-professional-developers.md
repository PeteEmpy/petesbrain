AI agents are everywhere now. But most of them still feel like black boxes. Unpredictable, hard to guide, and unreliable when the stakes are high.

That’s why JetBrains built [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/?utm_source=the_deep_view&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=junie_2025_primary), the coding agent for professionals. Junie is designed to help teams ship features faster _and_ with more confidence. It’s not just another AI tool or agent to add to your list; it’s built for real-world development inside the same trusted JetBrains ecosystem.

* Stay focused with deep integration in JetBrains IDEs and smooth hand-off to your existing Git workflows
