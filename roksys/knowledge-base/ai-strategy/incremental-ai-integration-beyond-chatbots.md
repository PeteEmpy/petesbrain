## Summary

- Advocates for an organic, incremental approach to integrating AI into existing products rather than defaulting to chatbot implementations
- Challenges the trend of forcing AI features into chatbot interfaces when other integration methods may be more effective
- Emphasizes strategic thinking about where and how AI adds value to products without disrupting user experience
- Suggests evaluating AI integration opportunities based on actual user needs rather than following technological trends

## Key Insights

- Not every AI implementation needs to be a conversational interface - consider embedded, context-aware AI features that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows
- Incremental AI adoption allows for testing, learning, and optimization without committing to a full chatbot overhaul that may not meet user needs
- Strategic AI integration should focus on solving specific user problems rather than implementing AI for the sake of appearing innovative
- Organizations should evaluate where AI can enhance existing features rather than defaulting to adding new chatbot interfaces as a catch-all solution
