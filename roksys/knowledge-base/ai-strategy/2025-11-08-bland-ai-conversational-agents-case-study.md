_We found an AI company that’s giving executives what they’ve always asked for._

Today, businesses all around the world are using** conversational AI** to handle things like lead qualification, appointment scheduling, and follow-up calls.

Until now.

Meet **[Bland](https://bland.ai?utm_source=deepdivenov8&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=nov8&utm_id=deepview+deep+dive)** – the AI company** **that believes **executives shouldn’t have to commit before they try**.

And since **97% of people who try** a pilot agent** **convert** **into long-term contracts, they reached out to us to try something different.
