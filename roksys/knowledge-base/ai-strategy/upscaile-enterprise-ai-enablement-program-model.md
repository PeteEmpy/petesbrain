## Summary

- Upscaile offers a Company-Wide AI Enablement Program designed to transform scattered AI experiments into organization-wide capability
- Program includes multi-session training with function-specific cohorts (Ops, CS, Finance, Sales) and embedded HR, Legal, and IT stakeholders
- Delivers practical prompting frameworks, clear guardrails, and a common organizational language around AI capabilities and risks
- Curriculum developed by team that built SHRM's AI credential, ensuring enterprise-grade quality and rollout discipline
- Custom-scoped delivery model with discovery phase, bespoke curriculum, cohort delivery, and reinforcement sessions

## Key Insights

- Scattered AI pilots fail without shared baselines and guardrails - structured enablement programs are essential for scaling adoption
- Cross-functional involvement (HR, Legal, IT) from day one prevents compliance and security issues that typically derail AI initiatives
- Function-specific cohorts with relevant use cases drive faster adoption than generic one-size-fits-all training
- Organizations need both practical skills (prompting frameworks) and organizational infrastructure (policies, common language) to succeed with AI
- Credible partners with enterprise training backgrounds (like SHRM credential development) can accelerate time-to-value versus building internal programs from scratch

 Hi  

## AI experiments pop up everywhere—but without a shared baseline and guardrails, adoption stalls. Our **Company-Wide AI Enablement Program** turns scattered pilots into an organization-wide capability, led by HR with Legal and IT embedded from day one.

**Program outcomes**

* **A common language** on capabilities, limits, and risks

* **Function-specific cohorts **(Ops, CS, Finance, Sales) with relevant use cases

* **Practical prompting frameworks** and productivity plays that managers can use immediately

* **Clear guardrails** aligned to your policies (privacy, accuracy, security)

**How it runs**

* **Multi-session program**, virtual or hybrid (on-site days optional)

* **Discovery → bespoke curriculum** & comms kit → cohort delivery → reinforcement sessions

* **Investment & timeline**: scoped to your size and functions (proposal provided after a 30-minute call)

**Why us?**
We deliver this model for enterprise teams and leadership groups; **our team has also built SHRM’s AI credential, ensuring that curriculum quality and rollout discipline are built in.**
