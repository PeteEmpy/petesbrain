## OpenAI spreads bets with $38B AWS partnership

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

OpenAI has signed a $38B, **seven-year partnership with Amazon Web Services** that grants use to "hundreds" of Nvidia GPUs for AI model training. 

🔓 Key Points 

* OpenAI will use AWS compute infrastructure to train its models, with **all capacity deployed before the end of 2026** and potential expansion through 2027 and beyond.

* The partnership comes as Microsoft is no longer OpenAI's exclusive provider, while OpenAI maintains **$250B in Azure commitments** that far exceed Amazon's agreement.

* OpenAI has major cloud contracts with three providers: $38B with Amazon, $250B with Microsoft, and **a reported $300B with Oracle**, spreading its infrastructure risk across multiple vendors.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This diversification strategy **reduces OpenAI's dependency on any single cloud provider** while securing the massive compute resources needed for next-generation AI development.
