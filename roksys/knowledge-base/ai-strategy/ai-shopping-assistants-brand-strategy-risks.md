## Summary

- AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity are actively integrating shopping capabilities, creating a new AI-powered commerce channel
- Brands and retailers are hesitant to participate due to concerns about data transparency and lack of performance metrics
- The passive approach risks brand invisibility as AI assistants become intermediaries in the consumer purchase journey
- This represents a fundamental shift in e-commerce similar to the early days of Amazon and Google Shopping
- Early adopters may gain competitive advantages in AI-powered discovery and recommendation algorithms

## Key Insights

- AI assistants are creating a new gatekeeper layer between brands and consumers, potentially disrupting traditional e-commerce funnels and reducing direct brand-to-consumer relationships
- Brands' hesitation to engage with AI shopping platforms due to data concerns mirrors early resistance to Amazon and Google - but waiting may result in being excluded from AI-driven product recommendations
- The lack of transparent performance data and attribution from AI shopping platforms creates a catch-22: brands need data to justify participation, but can only get data by participating
- This evolution signals a potential shift from search-based shopping to conversational commerce, requiring brands to rethink content strategy, product data optimization, and partnership approaches with AI platforms
