## Summary

- New CALM (Keep CALM) architecture design addresses the high computational costs of deploying generative AI models in enterprise environments
- Current AI models face prohibitive expenses in both training and inference due to immense computational demands
- The innovation targets the core inefficiency in model architecture that drives up operational costs and environmental impact
- Solution particularly relevant for enterprise leaders managing AI deployment budgets and seeking cost-effective implementation strategies

## Key Insights

- Enterprise AI adoption is heavily constrained by computational costs in both training and inference phases, making cost-efficient architectures critical for broader implementation
- The CALM architecture represents a paradigm shift in model design that could democratize enterprise AI access by reducing infrastructure requirements
- For marketing departments considering AI automation, understanding architectural efficiency can significantly impact long-term operational budgets and ROI calculations
- Environmental concerns around AI deployment are becoming a factor in enterprise decision-making, making efficient architectures both a cost and sustainability advantage
