## Summary

- PayPal launches Agentic Commerce Services with two features: Agent Ready (for accepting payments on AI platforms) and Shop Sync (for product discoverability across AI chat interfaces like Perplexity)
- The solution addresses merchant fragmentation challenges by providing one-to-many integration across multiple AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) without requiring separate integrations for each
- Multiple competing agent payment protocols exist (Google's AP2, OpenAI/Stripe's ACP, Visa's Trusted Agent Protocol), creating uncertainty for merchants on where to invest integration efforts
- PayPal's approach prioritizes flexibility by creating a central repository where AI models can ingest product data, enabling merchants to prepare for AI-powered commerce without committing to a single standard
- Agentic commerce is in early stages with Shop Sync available now and Agent Ready coming in 2026; merchants need to begin laying groundwork despite uncertainty about adoption speed

## Key Insights

- The fragmentation of AI chat platforms and payment protocols creates a strategic dilemma for merchants who must decide where to invest integration resources without clear market winners
- PayPal's positioning as a flexible intermediary leverages existing merchant relationships and infrastructure to reduce integration burden while maintaining merchant control over customer data and relationships
- Early adoption advantage exists for merchants who prepare product catalogs and payment systems for AI-powered discovery, even as the market standards remain unsettled
- The shift from traditional search-browse-cart experiences to conversational AI commerce will require merchants to rethink product discoverability and transaction flows
- Partnership strategy (Wix, Cymbio, Shopware) demonstrates ecosystem approach necessary for AI commerce adoption at scale

## Summary

<p>E<!-- -->nterprises looking to sell goods and services online are waiting for the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-vs-openai-vs-visa-competing-agent-protocols-threaten-the-future-of-ai"><u>backbone of agentic commerce</u></a> to be hashed out; but <a href="https://www.paypal.com/"><u>PayPal</u></a> is hoping its new features will bridge the gap.</p><p>The payments company is launching a discoverability solution that allows enterprises to make its product available on any chat platform, regardless of the model or agent payment protocol. </p><p>PayPal, which is a participant in <a href="https://www.google.com/"><u>Google</u></a>’s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-new-agent-payments-protocol-ap2-allows-ai-agents-to-complete"><u>Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)</u></a>, found that it can leverage its relationship with merchants and enterprises to help pave the way for an easier transition into agentic commerce and offer flexibility that will benefit the ecosystem. </p><p>Michelle Gill, PayPal&#x27;s GM for small business and financial services, told VentureBeat that AI-powered shopping will continue to grow, so enterprises and brands must begin laying the groundwork early. </p><p>“We think that merchants who&#x27;ve historically sold through web stores, particularly in the e-commerce space, are really going to need a way to get active on all of these large language models (LLMs),” Gill said. “The challenge is that no one really knows how fast all of this is going to move. We’re trying to help merchants think through how to do all of this as low-touch as possible while using the infrastructure they already have without doing a bazillion integrations.”</p><p>She added that AI shopping would also bring about “a resurgence from consumers trying to ensure their investment is protected.”</p><p>PayPal partnered with website builder <a href="https://www.wix.com/"><u>Wix</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cym.bio/"><u>Cymbio</u></a>, Commerce and <a href="https://shopware.com/"><u>Shopware</u></a> to bring products to chat platforms like <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/"><u>Perplexity</u></a>. 
</p><h2>Agent-powered shopping </h2><p>PayPal’s Agentic Commerce Services include two features. The first is Agent Ready, which would allow existing PayPal merchants to accept payments on AI platforms. The second is Shop Sync, which will enable companies’ product data to be discoverable through different AI chat interfaces. It takes a company’s catalog information and plug its inventory and fulfillment data to chat platforms. </p><p>Gill said the data goes into a central repository where AI models can ingest the information. </p><p>Right now, companies can access Shop Sync; Agent Ready is coming in 2026. </p><p>Gill said Agentic Commerce Services is a one-to-many solution that would be helpful right now, as different LLMs scrape different data sources to surface information. </p><p>Other benefits include:</p><ul><li><p>Fast integration with current and future partners;</p></li><li><p>More product discovery over the traditional search, browse and cart experiences;</p></li><li><p>Preserved customer insights and relationships where the brand continues to have control over their records and communications with customers. </p></li></ul><p>Right now, the service is only available through Perplexity, but Gill said more platforms will be added soon. </p><h2>Fragmented AI platforms </h2><p>
Agentic commerce is still very much in the early stages. AI agents are just beginning to get better at reading a browser. while platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity can now surface products and services based on user queries, people cannot technically buy things from chat (yet).</p><p>There’s a race right now to create a standard to enable agents to transact on behalf of users. Other than Google’s AP2, <a href="https://openai.com/"><u>OpenAI</u></a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/"><u>Stripe</u></a> have the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-debuts-new-chatgpt-buy-button-and-open-source-agentic-commerce"><u>Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)</u></a>, and <a href="https://usa.visa.com/"><u>Visa</u></a> recently launched its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/visa-just-launched-a-protocol-to-secure-the-ai-shopping-boom-heres-what-it"><u>Trusted Agent Protocol</u></a>. </p><p>Beyond enabling a trust layer for agents to transact, enterprises struggle with fragmentation in agentic commerce. Different chat platforms use different models, which also interpret information in slightly different ways. Gill said PayPal learned that when it comes to working with merchants, flexibility is critical. </p><p>“How do you decide if you&#x27;re going to spend your time integrating with Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT or Perplexity?&quot; Gill noted. &quot;And each one of them right now has a different protocol, a different catalog, config, a different everything. That is a lot of time to make a bet as to where you should spend your time.&quot; </p>
