## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: OpenAI's autonomous AI researcher tool and economic implications
**Reason**: While the article discusses a significant OpenAI product update, the limited content preview focuses on economic impact rather than specific marketing/advertising applications. The autonomous researcher capability could have business automation relevance, but without seeing concrete marketing use cases or actionable insights in the preview, it rates as medium relevance.
