## Summary

- Upscaile offers a Company-Wide AI Enablement Program designed to transform scattered AI experiments into organization-wide capability through HR-led implementation with Legal and IT integration
- Program delivers multi-session training with function-specific cohorts (Ops, CS, Finance, Sales), practical prompting frameworks, and clear policy-aligned guardrails
- Uses Discovery → curriculum design → cohort delivery → reinforcement model, with virtual or hybrid delivery options tailored to organization size
- Team credentials include building SHRM's AI credential, providing enterprise-grade curriculum quality and rollout expertise

## Key Insights

- Successful AI adoption requires moving from individual experiments to structured, company-wide programs with embedded governance from Legal and IT
- Function-specific cohorts with relevant use cases are more effective than one-size-fits-all AI training approaches
- Establishing a common language around AI capabilities, limitations, and risks is foundational to scaling adoption
- HR-led AI enablement programs can bridge the gap between technical capability and organizational readiness
- Practical frameworks and guardrails aligned to existing policies (privacy, accuracy, security) reduce adoption friction

 Hi  

## AI experiments pop up everywhere—but without a shared baseline and guardrails, adoption stalls. Our **Company-Wide AI Enablement Program** turns scattered pilots into an organization-wide capability, led by HR with Legal and IT embedded from day one.

**Program outcomes**

* **A common language** on capabilities, limits, and risks

* **Function-specific cohorts **(Ops, CS, Finance, Sales) with relevant use cases

* **Practical prompting frameworks** and productivity plays that managers can use immediately

* **Clear guardrails** aligned to your policies (privacy, accuracy, security)

**How it runs**

* **Multi-session program**, virtual or hybrid (on-site days optional)

* **Discovery → bespoke curriculum** & comms kit → cohort delivery → reinforcement sessions

* **Investment & timeline**: scoped to your size and functions (proposal provided after a 30-minute call)

**Why us?**
We deliver this model for enterprise teams and leadership groups; **our team has also built SHRM’s AI credential, ensuring that curriculum quality and rollout discipline are built in.**
