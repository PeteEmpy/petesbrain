## Summary

- Center for AI Safety and Scale AI introduced the Remote Labor Index (RLI), the first benchmark measuring AI agent performance on actual paid, remote jobs
- Benchmark results indicate AI agents currently perform poorly when attempting to automate real-world business tasks
- Provides critical baseline data for businesses evaluating AI agent deployment for workflow automation
- Highlights gap between AI agent marketing claims and actual capabilities in business automation contexts
- Relevant for setting realistic expectations when considering AI agents for marketing operations and business processes

## Key Insights

- Current AI agents significantly underperform on real-world job tasks compared to marketing promises, suggesting businesses should approach automation claims with skepticism
- The RLI benchmark provides an objective framework for evaluating AI agent capabilities before investment in automation infrastructure
- Marketing teams considering AI agents for workflow automation should pilot test on non-critical tasks first, given documented performance limitations
- This research suggests a phased approach to AI agent adoption is more prudent than wholesale replacement of human workers in marketing operations
