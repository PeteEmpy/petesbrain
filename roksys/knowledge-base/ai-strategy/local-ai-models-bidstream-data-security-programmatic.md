## Summary

- Third-party AI services accessing proprietary bidstream data create security vulnerabilities that internal audits increasingly flag as unacceptable risks
- Local AI model deployment allows organizations to leverage AI for programmatic advertising optimization while maintaining full data control within their infrastructure
- Performance and data security are the two critical factors when implementing AI in programmatic advertising environments
- Running AI models on-premises eliminates external data exposure while enabling real-time bidstream optimization
- Organizations are shifting away from cloud-based AI agents toward self-hosted solutions to protect competitive bidding intelligence

## Key Insights

- Security audits are driving the shift from third-party AI services to local deployment models, making data sovereignty a competitive advantage in programmatic advertising
- Organizations can achieve both AI-driven performance optimization and data security by deploying models within their own infrastructure rather than relying on external AI agents
- The bidstream contains highly sensitive competitive intelligence that requires protection - exposing it to third parties creates strategic vulnerabilities beyond compliance concerns
- Local AI implementation for programmatic requires balancing computational resources, latency requirements, and security protocols while maintaining real-time bidding capabilities

## Summary

<p>Author: Olga Zharuk, CPO, Teqblaze When it comes to applying AI in programmatic, two things matter most: performance and data security. I&#8217;ve seen too many internal security audits flag third-party AI services as exposure points. Granting third-party AI agents access to proprietary bidstream data introduces unnecessary exposure that many organisations are no longer willing to [&#8230;]</p>
