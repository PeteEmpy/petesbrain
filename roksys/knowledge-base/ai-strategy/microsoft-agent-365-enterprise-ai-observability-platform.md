## Summary

- Microsoft launched Agent 365 as a unified control plane for managing and monitoring AI agents across enterprises, addressing the critical challenge of 'agentic sprawl' and governance at scale
- The platform provides five core capabilities: centralized registry (Entra), access control with unique agent IDs, visual dashboards for performance monitoring, interoperability across platforms, and security controls
- Agent 365 supports both Microsoft-built and third-party agents (Adobe, Databricks, Cognition, ServiceNow), treating agents as infrastructure components requiring the same governance as human employees
- Unlike competitors (DataDog, Dynatrace, Splunk, Chronosphere) offering separate observability tools, Microsoft bundles capabilities into a single governed platform to reduce complexity
- The solution allows enterprises to discover agents through Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams, set adherence policies, and block misbehaving agents through centralized administration

## Key Insights

- Marketing teams deploying multiple AI agents for content creation, customer engagement, and campaign management will need enterprise-grade observability to prevent agent sprawl and maintain governance
- The shift from isolated AI experiments to unified agent ecosystems requires treating AI agents like employees—with proper access controls, performance monitoring, and security protocols
- Organizations should evaluate their current AI agent inventory and establish a centralized registry before agent proliferation creates governance and security vulnerabilities
- Marketing operations should assess whether their observability needs are better served by integrated platforms like Agent 365 versus point solutions from DataDog, Dynatrace, or specialized AI observability startups

# Microsoft’s Agent 365 shifts AI agents from sandbox tools to enterprise-grade infrastructure

## Summary

<p>Managing and maintaining AI systems <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/transform-2025-why-observability-is-critical-for-ai-agent-ecosystems"><u>remains a challenge</u></a> for many enterprises, particularly with the potential for agentic sprawl to expose businesses to risky entry points. </p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/"><u>Microsoft</u></a> entered the observability fray with the launch of Agent 365 during its annual Ignite conference Tuesday. It described Agent 365 as the control plane for AI agents, serving as an observability layer for enterprises running any agent. The company said the platform “delivers unified observability” through telemetry, dashboards, and alerts to track every agent in use.</p><p>Agent 365 supports any agents, whether built on Microsoft’s platforms or from third parties, including Adobe, Databricks, Cognition, and ServiceNow. </p><p>“Agent 365 marks a new chapter in how organizations build, secure, and scale their agents. This is a shift from isolated experiments to enterprise readiness, where agents operate as part of a unified, governed, and productive system,” said Microsoft&#x27;s president of business apps and agents, Charles Lamanna, in a blog post. </p><h2>What enterprises get</h2><p>Microsoft 365 has five capabilities: registry, access control, visualization, interoperability, and security.  </p><p>The first step in beginning observability tasks in Microsoft 365 is to log the agents that may be present, which will serve as a single source of truth. The company calls this registry Entra.</p><p>“This single registry tracks the agents for every relevant role within your organization — IT, developers, security, and business leaders. And with the Agent Store, users can easily discover the right agents for their role and workflows directly within Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams,” Microsoft said. </p><p>Access Control would require agents to have a unique agent ID, allowing enterprise admins to limit access as needed. Organizations can set policies that agents must adhere to, and the tool can respond by blocking misbehaving agents. </p><p>Agent 365 also offers a visual dashboard, allowing companies to see how their agents are connected, performance measurements, and task adherence. </p><p>For enterprises already dealing with agent sprawl, Microsoft’s approach stands out because it bundles what’s usually a patchwork of add-on tools into a single, governed control plane. Most observability options today are either siloed features or separate platforms that add more complexity. Agent 365 treats agents as parts of the stack, giving IT and security teams unified oversight at a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-sleepwalking-into-agentic-ai-sprawl">moment when that’s becoming essential</a>.</p><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"><u>DataDog</u></a>, Dynatrace and Splunk offer observability services for AI systems. The startup <a href="https://chronosphere.io/"><u>Chronosphere</u></a> released capabilities similar to observability, focusing on debugging issues, and <a href="https://raindrop.io/"><u>Raindrop</u></a> also <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-your-ai-app-pissing-off-users-or-going-off-script-raindrop-emerges-with-ai-native-observability-platform-to-monitor-performance"><u>introduced its own observability</u></a> tools for performance. </p><p>Google also began offering an observability dashboard on its AI Agent Builder.  </p><p>“As agents multiply in numbers and sophistication, companies face a new kind of challenge: how to manage and govern agents responsibly and at scale, without rebuilding the trusted systems they rely on,” Lamanna said. “The clearest path forward is to manage agents the way you manage people, using the same infrastructure, apps, and protections that power your business today.”</p>

## Scoring Analysis
