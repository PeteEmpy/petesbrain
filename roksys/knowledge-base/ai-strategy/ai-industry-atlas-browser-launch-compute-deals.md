**Welcome back. **In a move that likely comes as no surprise, tech giants are once again eyeing billion-dollar deals to increase their compute capacity. First up, Meta has [struck a $27 billion financing deal](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-forms-joint-venture-with-blue-owl-capital-louisiana-data-center-2025-10-21/) with Blue Owl Capital to fund a massive data center project in Louisiana, marking the social media giant’s largest private capital deal to date. Anthropic, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks with Google to provide the AI firm with more compute capacity, a deal valued at tens of billions of dollars, [according to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/anthropic-google-in-talks-on-cloud-deal-worth-tens-of-billions). These add to the rapidly [piling number of compute deals ](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/amd-oracle-partnership-highlights-nvidia-rivalry)as tech firms scrabble to secure the resources they need to eke out ahead of AI competition.

# The AI search battle heats up

The AI search wars have a new competitor – one that just might have a leg up. 

On Tuesday, OpenAI unveiled Atlas, a new web browser built [“with ChatGPT at its core.”](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/) The browser is now available on macOS for all OpenAI Free, Plus, Pro, and Go users, as well as in beta for Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans. Android, iOS, and Windows experiences are on the way. 

The company noted in its press release that Atlas builds off of the success it saw with adding search to its flagship chatbot, ChatGPT, and brings it closer to creating a “true super-assistant.” 

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1980685602384441368)

Users have the option to allow Atlas to remember context from the sites they visit to answer queries, and it offers an “agent mode” that enables automation to work with a user’s browsing context. 

CEO Sam Altman said in a livestream on Tuesday that “AI represents a rare once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about.” 

The release of Atlas puts OpenAI in direct competition with two major AI rivals: Perplexity and Google. 

* Perplexity has been [particularly active lately](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/how-sf-compute-corners-to-offtake-market), launching the free version of its Comet browser at the beginning of October, launching “background assistants” that work with users’ context, and forging media partnerships for an AI-powered news feed. 

* Google, which holds market dominance in the search space, has long been working on implementing AI into its popular browser with things like AI overviews. (Shares of its parent company, [Alphabet, fell on the news](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/openai-browser-alphabet-stock.html) of Atlas’ release.)

Despite competition, OpenAI might have an upper hand. AI is changing the way people surface information: According to Similarweb, nearly 14% of users who visited Google in September [also visited ChatGPT](https://x.com/similarweb/status/1980562663202779269?s=46&t=-0uT4XoIJ-cjXoQMtjEyVg). AI is also changing the makeup of who is using the internet broadly, as bots account for a rapidly [growing percentage of all internet traffic](https://cyberpress.org/ai-driven-bad-bots-now-make-up/).

OpenAI making a play for the search market is a no-brainer. Despite holding the title of the most valuable private company, its [revenue sits far, far below its valuation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-big-chip-orders-dwarf-011450794.html), and it still hasn’t managed to make a profit. A browser could give OpenAI the opportunity to eventually sell ads, opening the door to an incredibly lucrative market that has allowed tech giants like Google and Meta to make their fortunes. Breaking into this business could help it finally see some return on the billions it has poured into its models.

# Anthropic weighs in on regulation

Anthropic is at the center of an AI regulation catfight. 

On Tuesday, [Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-dario-amodei-american-ai-leadership) put out a statement addressing "inaccurate claims” circulating about the company’s policy stances. The statement follows venture capitalist David Sacks, the Trump Administration’s appointed AI and crypto czar, criticizing Anthropic for running a [“regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,”](https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1978145266269077891) or pushing for state regulation that benefits small players while hurting startups.  

Other tech leaders have since chimed in on Sack’s criticism, with investor Reid Hoffman rebutting on Monday that Anthropic is “one of the good guys” [in a post on X](https://x.com/reidhoffman/status/1980275172033589339). 

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/1980275172033589339)

Despite Sacks’ claims, Amodei said in the statement that the company aligns with the Trump administration on key areas of AI policy, including praising the administration’s AI Action Plan and hiring policy experts from both sides of the aisle. 

And while Amodei argued in favor of a “national AI standard” over a “patchwork set of state laws,” the rapid development of the tech has made it difficult for Congress to regulate, he said. It’s why Anthropic supported [California’s SB 53](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/legal-ai-frenzy-grows-as-eve-hits-1b), which forces large developers to implement safety protocols, with companies below $500 million in revenue being exempt. 

“Some have suggested that we are somehow interested in harming the startup ecosystem,” Amodei said. “Startups are among our most important customers.” 

The argument highlights the thorny regulatory environment that AI development in the US faces. The crux of the push and pull between state and federal regulation and AI developers lies in the argument over whether regulation itself is a hindrance to innovation. But as that fight continues and regulation stalls, AI is only getting more powerful, growing the gap between the tech and the ability to control it.

# Amazon leans into robotic warehouse automation

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f17b7e51-c0bb-41d5-a247-bd2fef9bddf4/ART3__0-00-00-00___37_.jpg?t=1761126142)

Amazon might be preparing its AI for the future of the holiday rush. 

On Tuesday, [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html) reported that the e-commerce giant plans to use robotic automation to avoid hiring more than 600,000 US workers by 2033. Amazon’s robotics team is working towards automating 75% of the company’s operations, with 160,000 roles on the chopping block by 2027, according to documents viewed by the Times. 

The automation would save 30 cents per item sold, totalling $12.6 billion between 2025 and 2027. 

Amazon told The Deep View that its investment in automation and efficiency gains will enable it to expand into new business areas, as well as upskill its workforce for evolving roles. 

Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the documents don’t reflect the company’s overall hiring strategy, just that of one team, and that “leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that’s the case here.” Nantel noted that the company plans to fill 250,000 positions ahead of the holiday rush. 

Amazon’s push for automation is far from singular. Companies across industries are seeking to automate tedious tasks and roles with AI, resulting in plans for major workforce restructuring: 

* [Airline Lufthansa](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/are-ai-models-the-future-of-fashion) cut 4,000 roles in late September as it leans into AI, focusing on administrative roles. 

* [Klarna](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/klarna-ceo-says-ai-helped-company-shrink-workforce-by-40percent.html?) and  [Salesforce](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/salesforce-layoffs-artificial-intelligence/3941975/) both cut thousands of staff this year, with their CEOs confirming that AI allowed them to do so. 

* [Accenture](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/2025/accenture-ceo-tells-staff-to-use-ai-or-leave?) announced plans to “exit” staff who were unable to be reskilled on AI, with 11,000 already receiving the boot. 

Workforce automation is the primary way that many AI firms expect to notch returns. Given Amazon's commitment to and investment in developing AI, as well as its longstanding research in robotics, a move like this is hardly surprising.
