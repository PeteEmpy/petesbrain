- Instructions provided for removing the data provider connection if approval was granted in error

## Key Insights

Hello,

Your request to Shopify to provide point-of-sales sales and inventory data  
has been approved. No action is needed on your side until you receive  
the 'Approved: You have successfully completed the onboarding process to  
show local products on Google' message for next steps.

If you think that this is a mistake and Shopify should not be sending your  
data to Google to show your local products on Google, please go to your  
Merchant Center account  
<https://c.gle/APy2Ad1zcwHNcBh3F3rTmweqyWbJIh-GQXD69t2FZZP544ngJQDaQwOKwQt_FmlxjriIk3UxxFXRc2wNfTrZpdSyWfXjgjT8TEa0ilvSIQXeY-cxTeTywZr7ZRVKhZBlSqToqRNiX9pzv-aNOHvcqCI>,  
Positive Bakes 395496688 and remove the point-of-sales or inventory data  
provider.
