## Summary

- Lucy Loughlin (Google Account Strategist) proposes consolidating two separate account review meetings into one joint call
- Meeting scheduled for November 6, 2025 at 11:00 AM to discuss both Accessories for the Home and Uno Lights accounts

## Key Insights

- Google is proactively suggesting efficiency improvements in account management communication during peak periods
- Two separate client accounts (Accessories for the Home and Uno Lights) are being managed by Roksys with oversight from different Google representatives

## Message

Hi Peter,

I hope all is well!

I was chatting with Luiza (cc'd) and we thought given the busy period we
are in at the moment, it might help save you time if we all connect
together.

I know we are both due to touch base with you tomorrow on Accessories for
the Home & Uno Lights, so do let us know if you'd prefer to cover both
accounts during our call at 11?

All the best,
Lucy
