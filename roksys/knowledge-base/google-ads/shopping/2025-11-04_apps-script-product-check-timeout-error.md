## Summary

- Automated script 'dailyProductCheck' experienced server error and timeout
- Script ran for 30 minutes before timing out (5:31 AM - 6:01 AM GMT)
- Time-based trigger failure suggests either data volume or API issues
- Requires investigation into script efficiency and error handling

## Key Insights
