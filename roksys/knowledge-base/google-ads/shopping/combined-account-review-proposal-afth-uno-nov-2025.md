## Message

Hi Peter,

I hope all is well!

I was chatting with Luiza (cc'd) and we thought given the busy period we
are in at the moment, it might help save you time if we all connect
together.

I know we are both due to touch base with you tomorrow on Accessories for
the Home & Uno Lights, so do let us know if you'd prefer to cover both
accounts during our call at 11?

All the best,
Lucy
