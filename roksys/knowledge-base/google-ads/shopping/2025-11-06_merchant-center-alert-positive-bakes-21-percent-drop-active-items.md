## Summary

- Google Merchant Center detected a 21% drop in active items (113 to 89) for Positive Bakes account between 07:40-13:40 GMT on November 6, 2025
- The drop affected Shopping ads in GB market, with 24 items becoming inactive and unavailable across Google products
- Alert threshold met (20%+ drop) triggering automated notification to account administrator
- Diagnostics page access provided for detailed investigation of item disapprovals and issues
- Merchant Center Account ID: 395496688 for Positive Bakes

## Key Insights

- Significant feed quality issue requiring immediate attention - 21% of product inventory lost in 6-hour window suggests data feed error, API disconnection, or bulk product disapprovals
- The sudden drop pattern (within 6 hours) indicates technical issue rather than gradual inventory depletion - likely caused by feed upload failure, policy violations, or attribute errors
- Impact is isolated to GB market Shopping ads, suggesting country-specific feed issues or shipping/tax configuration problems rather than global account suspension
- Immediate action required: Check diagnostics page for specific item-level errors, verify feed upload status, review recent product data changes, and ensure API connections are functioning properly
