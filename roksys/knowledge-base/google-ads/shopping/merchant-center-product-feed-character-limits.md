## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, for SEO Shopify recommends 70 characters for the Title &amp; 160 characters for the Description.</p> <p>In Merchant Center, if you click on Edit product, it recommends 150 characters for the Title &amp; 5000 characters for the Description.</p> <p>I'm not an expert but I'm thinking you should probably try to handle both recommendations.</p> <p>We use Simprosys. How would we do this? In other words, how would we do the 70/160 for Shopify site SEO and also the 150/5000 for the Merchant Center using the App? Is it possible? Tks for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waves731"> /u/waves731 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oroe9p/cro_optimization_for_shopify_site_merchant_center/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oroe9p/cro_optimization_for_shopify_site_merchant_center/">[comments]</a></span>

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Google Merchant Center product feed optimization for Shopping campaigns
**Reason**: This content addresses Google Merchant Center product title and description optimization, which is directly relevant to Google Shopping campaigns and Performance Max. However, it's a basic user question rather than a comprehensive guide or strategic insight, and incorrectly labels the topic as 'CRO optimization' when it's actually about product feed management.
