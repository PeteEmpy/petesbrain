# [AMA] "How do you run BRAND campaigns in Shopping when you run PMax campaigns?"

Last week I shared how I run Standard Shopping Campaigns that
target branded searches (email repeated below for your
convenience).
Manuel Regidor (name shared with permission) replied with a
follow-up question that many of you asked:

Hi Nils,

Thanks so much for sharing this detailed breakdown on brand
campaigns in Shopping! This is incredibly helpful.
I'm curious - how would you apply this same strategy within a
Performance Max feed only campaign? Since there are no priority
campaigns. I'd love to hear your approach.
Looking forward to your insights!

Happy to help Manuel. Here you go:

To run a Standard Shopping campaign that only targets branded
searches, next to Performance Max campaigns, do this:

1. Next to your existing PMax campaigns, create a _high-priority_
AND a _medium-priority_ standard shopping campaign for brand
searches
2. Add the products you want to show for your branded searches to
both these campaigns (exact same set of products in both
campaigns)
3. Ensure all branded searches will be funneled to the
med-priority brand campaign by adding your brand searches to a
negative keyword list that is attached to
a) the high-priority brand campaign
b) _all_ your PMax campaigns, and
c) all other non-brand shopping campaigns.
4. Set extremely low manual CPC bids in the high-priority brand
campaign. This will ensure Google will rarely spend any money on
the non-branded searches that will land in this campaign.
5. Set high manual CPC bids or allow for high CPC bids in your
bidding strategy for the medium-priority brand campaign. This
will ensure maximum visibility for all the branded searches that
will land in this campaign.

Advantages of this setup:
A) your PMax campaigns are forced to optimize for conversions
from non-branded searches instead of going after the low-hanging
fruit of branded searches.
(Note that the significantly higher than average ROAS of
branded searches in PMax hides the underperformance of the
non-brand searches in that same PMax campaign; we and smart
bidding only look at the aggregate result, allowing PMax to
underperform on non-brand).
B) you have tight control over both the CPC bids, your impression
share, and the exact products you want to show for your branded
searches via the medium-priority standard shopping campaign.

NB: Make sure the high-priority campaign never runs out of budget
before the medium-priority campaign does. Otherwise, non-branded
searches might end up being matched by the medium-priority
campaign. I use a shared budget for this. Also, make sure ad
schedules, audience targeting, device targeting and location
targeting are the same for both campaigns.

Friend-of-the-list Jochem P. (name shared with permission) asked:
"How do you run BRAND campaigns in Shopping?"

First, let's start with how _not_ to run a brand campaign in
shopping:

The wrong way to set up a brand campaign in Shopping is to:
1. Create a separate shopping campaign for brand searches
2. Have Google match all your products to a wide set of
non-branded searches, and then
3. Use a script to negate all these non-branded searches from
your brand shopping campaign in the hope that eventually Google
will only show the products for branded searches

The reason this is the wrong way is:
A. You will lose a lot of money on clicks on non-branded searches
before all these non-branded searches get negated, and
B. You will end up having to negate more searches than the limits
of negative keywords and negative keyword lists will allow you to
do. This is because Google goes very broad when matching your
products to user queries.

A right way to set up a brand campaign in Shopping is to:
1. Create a separate _low-priority_ shopping campaign for brand
searches
2. Add the products you want to show for your branded searches to
this low-priority brand shopping campaign
3. Set high manual CPC bids or allow for high CPC bids in your
bidding strategy to ensure maximum visibility for all the branded
searches that will land in this campaign.
4. Ensure branded searches will be funneled to this low-priority
brand campaign by adding your brand searches to a negative
keyword list that is attached to all other non-brand shopping
campaigns.

This will make sure the products in your brand campaign will only
be shown for branded searches, and you have tight control over
both the CPC bids, your impression share, and the exact products
you want to show for your branded searches.

NB: Make sure _all_ the products in your low-priority campaign
are also added to non-brand high or medium-priority campaigns,
AND that these high and medium priority campaigns never run out
of budget before your brand campaign does. Otherwise, non-branded
searches might end up being matched by the low-priority brand
campaign. Also make sure ad schedules, audience targeting, device
targeting and location targeting are the same for all campaigns.
