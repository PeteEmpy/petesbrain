## Summary

- Google Merchant Center link request to Shopify for point-of-sale and inventory data has expired due to no data received
- The integration was intended to display local product inventory on Google for Tree2mydoor account (ID: 107469209)
- Action required: Contact Shopify representative to resolve the data transmission issue, then resubmit the link request in Merchant Center
- This affects the ability to show local product availability to potential customers searching on Google

## Key Insights

- Integration failure indicates a breakdown in data transmission between Shopify and Google Merchant Center, preventing local inventory visibility on Google
- The expired link suggests the integration wasn't completed within Google's required timeframe, likely due to configuration issues on the Shopify side
- This impacts local SEO and shopping visibility, as products won't show real-time inventory availability to nearby customers
- Immediate action needed: Verify Shopify Google Channel app is properly configured and authorized to share inventory data with Google

Hello,

Your request to allow Shopify to provide point-of-sale and inventory data  
to show local products on Google has expired because we haven't received  
the data from your point-of-sale or inventory data provider.

If you think that this is a mistake, contact your point-of-sale or  
inventory data provider's representative. Afterwards, you can send the  
request again by going to your Merchant Center account, Tree2mydoor  
107469209, and selecting the point-of-sale or inventory data provider again.
If you have questions, we want to help. Contact the Merchant Center Support  
team here.

Yours sincerely,
The Google Merchant Center team
