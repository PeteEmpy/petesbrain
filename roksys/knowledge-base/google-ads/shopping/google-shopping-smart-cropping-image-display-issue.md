## Summary

- Google has implemented a default 'Smart Cropping' feature that automatically crops product images in Shopping ads
- The feature is enabled by default and may negatively impact how products are displayed to potential customers
- Advertisers cannot disable Smart Cropping themselves and must contact Google support to request it be turned off
- This automated cropping could be cutting off important product details or context in Shopping ad images
- The feature represents another example of Google's automated optimizations that may not align with advertiser preferences

## Key Insights

- Default automation settings in Google Ads may not always improve performance - advertisers should audit how their Shopping ads are actually displaying
- Smart Cropping is not advertiser-controllable through standard settings, requiring support intervention to disable
- Product image quality and composition remain critical for Shopping ads, but automated cropping may undermine carefully crafted product photography
- Advertisers should proactively check their Shopping ad previews across devices to identify unwanted cropping
- This feature adds to the growing list of automated Google Ads features that reduce advertiser control over campaign presentation
