Hi Devin,

Thanks for sharing the slides, Beth (bethstimpson@smythson.com<mailto:bethstimpson@smythson.com>) is our digital product owner who will be joining the call. We will need to create new conversion actions as at the moment we can see that the EUR and ROW are using the GA4 conversion action rather than the google ads purchase conversion action.

Kind regards,
Lauryn

Hi all,

Thanks for your time yesterday. Was great to chat through the Peak Plan.

I have attached the slides we discussed.

Regarding the tagging, I can book a call with the Tag Team. Please share the details of the web developer who will need to join the call. In addition, are you looking to modify the existing actions or create new ones?

Regards,
Devin
