## Transcript

They just released the ability to see what search partners are. And for me, I don't know how useful this is going to be like now and forever. But for right now where we've never had that visibility to see what search partners are running, to be able to see that I think is pretty cool. And then, you know, maybe it'll be like one time where you go and do a bunch of negatives and don't look at it all the time. Or maybe it will be like an ongoing thing. But I'm pretty excited about what has always been a black box finally us having some transparency into. I think that's pretty cool. No, that's that's absolutely huge news. And as we're recording this, it's I think it's like two days ago that it happened. Uh by the time you're watching this, it'll be about a month old. So, if you looked at it recently and it wasn't there, go check again because it is really cool data.
