## Transcript

This is a little bit of a meta answer, but you know, I think it's an authority bias. We say, okay, Google has the world's data. Google has so much data. Therefore, everything that it does is based on its knowledge of an end user and it's going to be to the benefit of me, the advertiser. Those things are completely separated, right? It's true that Google has tons of data. It's also true that it's not always acting in the best interest of an individual advertiser. So there's a lot that you still need to do to protect yourself, to set guard rails, to do everything. And I see a lot of people make the mistake of just thinking, "Oh, I just thought if I put all my keywords into one campaign that Google would figure out which ad to show or, you know, do this thing right for me or handle this thing so I didn't have to like understand it or think about it. Google would just get it right. And Google's not motivated to get it right to the extent that you are. So like it can burn through a lot of your cash and still benefit from that and you don't benefit from that. So like being aware of what controls you have and exercising them, you know, critically I think is is a really important skill that a lot of newcomers don't have. And I think that they're being a little bit scared of doing that because again it can seem anti-tech, you know, to like be clinging on to what we could do in the past. Like everyone wants to just kind of give free reign to Google and that's not always a good idea.
