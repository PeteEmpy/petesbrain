## Message

Hi Peter,

I'm not sure if you've seen an auto decline on all my calendar invites, but
just wanted to send you a message directly that I'll have to cancel
tomorrow's call.

My father passed away so I will be off for a few weeks, but if there's
anything urgent my manager Ally - allyhamps@google.com should be able to
help. I'll reach out once I am back to schedule a catch up on the account.

Thank you,
Solomiya
