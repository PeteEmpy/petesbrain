## Summary

- Technical support escalation for implementing Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL) at National Design Academy
- Offline conversion data import via Google Sheets failing due to timestamp format errors
- Multiple support touchpoints with confusion over case assignment and follow-up coordination
- Need for technical call with same specialist who provided initial guidance to resolve implementation issues
- Case number 7-5170000038434 created but coordination issues between client, account rep (Solomiya), and technical support team

## Key Insights

- Enhanced Conversions for Leads implementation requires careful coordination between account managers, technical support, and client technical teams
- Timestamp formatting in offline conversion imports is a common technical barrier that requires specialist support
- Documentation via email support (cut-and-paste responses) is insufficient when technical implementation has already been discussed in previous meetings
- Continuity of technical support personnel is important - clients benefit from working with the same specialist who understands their specific setup
- Support coordination breaks down when account managers are OOO without proper handoff - case was created without proper context (missing client ID, wrong invitees)

    Hi Patrick

An update for you - Henry received an email from support which was a cut and paste explanation of what needs to be done. We have already had a meeting with your guys in which it was explained what was required and now we are in a position for the tech guys to test it. Thesis a follow on from the tech guys previous call so it would be get the same person on a call.

Regards

Peter

    Hi Patrick

We’re really confused here as we’ve had nothing. I have received a tech invite from somebody on case number

7-5170000038434

but Henry was not invited and there was no client id quoted so I don’t even know if it was pertaining to National Design Academy

Could you check from your side please

 Regards, Peter

 Hey Peter and Henry,
Lovely to e-meet you both and thank you Ally for looping me in. 

I just created a case on Solomiya's behalf.  You should be receiving a link through which you can book a time slot shortly. 

Do please let me know if you don't receive that or have any queries between now and then, happy to support. 

All the best!

Patrick

    Hi Ally

In Solomiya’s absence are you able to help me with the implementation of Enhanced Conversions For Leads for my client. 

Solomiya set a meeting up for myself and Henry at the National Design Academy and following on from that the code and conversion action have been implemented. The first import of offline conversion data via the Gsheet has failed due to errors in the timestamp. The format is as had been discussed with the tech team.

What would be great is to have another call where we can check the code and the offline conversion data, can you arrange this?

Thanks

Peter
