## Summary

- Email thread documenting scheduling challenges between Google Account Manager (Luiza Arruda) and Roksys agency (Peter Empson) for Uno Lights Google Ads account review
- Multiple missed connections due to calendar confusion and conflicting recurring meeting invites from October 14 through November 4, 2025
- Final resolution to delete old recurring events and schedule new meeting for Thursday at 1:30 PM
- Primary communication issue: Peter had meeting scheduled for morning while Luiza expected afternoon call

## Key Insights

- Calendar management issues can disrupt client-agency-platform relationships; importance of confirming meeting times and removing duplicate recurring invites
- Google provides dedicated account managers for active advertisers with regular check-in calls to discuss account performance
- Multiple scheduling tools and recurring invites can create confusion; best practice is to centralize and clean up calendar systems regularly
- This represents ongoing relationship maintenance between Roksys and Google for the Uno Lights client account

## Message

Hi Peter,

Apologies for that, let's both delete the recurring events on the calendar
and start new.

I will send an invite for Thursday at 1;30 pm. Would that work for you?

Thanks,
