- PMax Synergy is highlighted as a critical component, suggesting integration between Performance Max and other campaign types is essential for peak season
- Smart Bidding Calibration is positioned as a necessary optimization step, likely due to increased competition and volatile conversion patterns during holiday shopping
- The immediate upload and recommendation to involve Google reps suggests these strategies represent significant platform best practices or new features
- Focus on November ROI indicates optimization window is narrow and implementation should be prioritized before peak Black Friday/Cyber Monday period
