## Message

Hi Peter,
I totally understand. Unfortunately, for this specific beta, I have a few
survey questions to compliantly confirm with the account before we apply. I
am available to meet 15 minutes early next week. We can then follow up via
email.

*Book a meeting here* <https://calendar.app.google/1nGAsAN6oS7GhhQm8>  or
let me know if Tuesday morning or afternoon works for you.

Best,
Morene
