## Summary

- Scheduled Google Technical Support appointment for Lead Generation setup on November 13, 2025, 10:30-11:30 PM Asia/Calcutta timezone
- Requires three mandatory attendees: website admin with FTP access, CRM admin, and Google Ads account manager
- Technical implementation session for lead generation tracking codes on website, campaigns, and analytics accounts
- Pre-call requirements include calendar acceptance, website backup, and Google Meet screen sharing capability
- Google disclaims responsibility for campaign spending increases or website functionality issues post-implementation

## Key Insights

- Google requires significant technical resources and stakeholder alignment (3 specific roles) for lead generation implementation, indicating complexity of proper setup
- The liability disclaimer emphasizes that tracking implementation changes carry business risk, particularly around potential ad spend increases - budget monitoring is critical post-implementation
- Maximum 3 reschedules allowed and requirement for all attendees to accept suggests Google is managing support resource allocation carefully
- Website backup requirement before implementation highlights potential for code conflicts or site disruption during technical setup
- This is a hands-on guided implementation session, not just consultation - prepare for real-time changes to website and ad accounts
