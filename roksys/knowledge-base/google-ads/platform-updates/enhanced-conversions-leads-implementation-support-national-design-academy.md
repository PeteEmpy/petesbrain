## Summary

- Peter Empson from Roksys requests help implementing Enhanced Conversions for Leads for National Design Academy client
- Initial setup meeting completed with Solomiya, code and conversion action implemented
- First offline conversion data import via Google Sheets failed due to timestamp format errors
- Original Google contact (Solomiya) is out of office until end of June, requesting manager Ally Hamps to arrange follow-up call
- Need to troubleshoot both code implementation and offline conversion data formatting

## Key Insights

- Enhanced Conversions for Leads requires precise timestamp formatting for offline conversion imports to succeed
- Implementation involves multiple stages: initial setup meeting, code implementation, conversion action setup, and data import validation
- Google Sheets integration for offline conversions is sensitive to data format specifications, requiring technical validation
- When primary Google rep is unavailable, escalating to manager (Ally Hamps) is the appropriate channel for ongoing implementation support

Hi Ally

In Solomiya’s absence are you able to help me with the implementation of Enhanced Conversions For Leads for my client. 

Solomiya set a meeting up for myself and Henry at the National Design Academy and following on from that the code and conversion action have been implemented. The first import of offline conversion data via the Gsheet has failed due to errors in the timestamp. The format is as had been discussed with the tech team.

What would be great is to have another call where we can check the code and the offline conversion data, can you arrange this?

Thanks

Peter
