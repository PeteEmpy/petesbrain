Hi Peter,

I've been trying to reach you over the past few weeks to schedule some time
to go over your Google Ads account, unfortunately without success.

I know schedules get crazy and time is precious, my intent is not to
clutter your inbox. Please respond with one of the following 3 letters so I
can know where to go from here:

A: I've been busy, but let's set a quick call in the next couple days. Book
Appointment to schedule time at your earliest convenience.
B: I have more pressing items I need to prioritize, please hang on and I'll
get back to you soon.
C: Busy at the moment, please send recommendations via email. If you choose
this option, please also confirm your CIDs for the accounts and the common
marketing objective.

Below is the accounts that my team has been assigned for Q4'25

Account Description Account ID
Artze Wall Art - 71981332 413-484-XXXX
Grain Guard 439-194-XXXX


Thanks and Regards,
