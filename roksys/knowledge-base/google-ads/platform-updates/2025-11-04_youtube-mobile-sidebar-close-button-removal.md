## Summary

- YouTube has permanently removed the close option for mobile ad sidebars, forcing shoppable panels to remain visible throughout horizontal video ads
- This change affects advertisers running video campaigns with shopping elements, ensuring persistent product visibility during ad playback
- The update represents a shift toward more prominent e-commerce integration in YouTube's mobile advertising experience
- Mobile users can no longer dismiss shoppable panels, potentially increasing product engagement but may impact user experience
- Advertisers should monitor engagement metrics and consider how this persistent sidebar affects campaign performance

## Key Insights

- This forced sidebar visibility represents YouTube's commitment to enhancing shopping features within video ads, prioritizing advertiser product visibility over user control
- Advertisers running YouTube video campaigns with product feeds should expect potentially higher sidebar engagement rates due to persistent visibility, but should monitor for any negative impact on completion rates
- The change aligns with broader industry trends toward seamless in-platform shopping experiences, making product discovery more integrated into the ad viewing experience
- Creative strategy may need adjustment - since sidebars are now permanent, ensure product selections in feeds are highly relevant and compelling throughout the entire video duration
- Consider A/B testing video ad creative with and without shopping sidebars enabled to measure the impact on overall campaign metrics like view-through rate and conversion performance
