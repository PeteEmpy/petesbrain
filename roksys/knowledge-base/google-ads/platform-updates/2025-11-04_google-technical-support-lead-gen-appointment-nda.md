## Summary

- Scheduled Google Technical Support appointment for Lead Generation implementation on Nov 4, 2025, 10:30-11:30 PM (Asia/Calcutta timezone)
- Requires three key attendees: website administrator with FTP/admin access, CRM point of contact with admin access, and Google Ads manager
- Technical setup session to implement lead generation tracking codes on website, CRM, and Google Ads account
- Mandatory pre-call requirements include accepting calendar invite, backing up website, and having Google Meet ready for screen sharing
- Case ID 7-6155000039426 can be rescheduled maximum 3 times; all attendees must accept invite or appointment will be canceled

## Key Insights

- Google requires formal authorization and acceptance of calendar invite before Technical Specialists can make changes to accounts - this protects both parties and ensures proper consent
- The requirement for three specific attendees (website admin, CRM admin, Google Ads manager) indicates this is a comprehensive implementation touching multiple platforms - suggests proper lead gen setup requires cross-functional coordination
- Google explicitly disclaims responsibility for spending increases and results - reinforces that technical implementation is separate from campaign performance optimization
- Website backup requirement before call is critical - any technical implementation carries risk of breaking existing functionality
- Screen sharing capability is essential for these technical support sessions - allows real-time guidance and troubleshooting during implementation
