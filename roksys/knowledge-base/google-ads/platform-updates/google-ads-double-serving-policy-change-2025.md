## Summary

- Google Ads has changed its policy to allow a single advertiser to appear twice on the same search results page (SERP)
- This policy shift raises questions about fairness, transparency, and competitive dynamics in paid search auctions
- The change potentially benefits large advertisers with bigger budgets who can dominate SERP real estate
- Impacts bidding strategy as advertisers may now compete against themselves for multiple placements
- Requires reassessment of campaign structure and budget allocation strategies

## Key Insights

- Double-serving fundamentally changes the competitive landscape by allowing single advertisers to capture multiple ad positions, potentially reducing visibility for smaller competitors
- Advertisers need to evaluate whether pursuing multiple placements is cost-effective or if they're essentially bidding against themselves and inflating their own costs
- Campaign structure may need adjustment to account for potential double-serving scenarios, including separate tracking and budget considerations for multiple ad appearances
- This policy change highlights Google's ongoing balance between revenue optimization and maintaining a fair marketplace for advertisers of all sizes
