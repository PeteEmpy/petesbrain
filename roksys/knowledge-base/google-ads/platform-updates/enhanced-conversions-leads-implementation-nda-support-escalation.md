## Summary

- Peter Empson (Roksys) seeking continued technical support from Google reps for implementing Enhanced Conversions for Leads for National Design Academy client
- Initial implementation completed with code and conversion action setup, but first offline conversion data import via Google Sheets failed due to timestamp format errors
- Multiple support handoffs occurring: Solomiya Karplyuk (OOO until end of June) → Ally Hamps → Patrick White, with confusion around case number 7-5170000038434
- Client frustrated by receiving generic cut-and-paste support responses rather than continuation with original technical team familiar with the case
- Requesting follow-up technical call to verify code implementation and troubleshoot offline conversion data import issues

## Key Insights

- Enhanced Conversions for Leads implementation requires careful coordination between agency, client, and Google technical teams, particularly for offline data imports
- Timestamp formatting in Google Sheets imports is a critical failure point that requires technical expertise to resolve
- Support continuity is essential - generic responses and team changes create frustration when dealing with complex technical implementations
- Case management becomes fragmented when primary Google contact goes on extended leave without proper handoff protocols
- Agencies need direct access to technical specialists who understand the full context rather than being routed through general support channels

    Hi AllyIn Solomiya’s absence are you able to help me with the implementation of Enhanced Conversions For Leads for my client. Solomiya set a meeting up for myself and Henry at the National Design Academy and following on from that the code and conversion action have been implemented. The first import of offline conversion data via the Gsheet has failed due to errors in the timestamp. The format is as had been discussed with the tech team.What would be great is to have another call where we can check the code and the offline conversion data, can you arrange this?ThanksPeter   On 26 May 2025 at 18:40:32, Solomiya Karplyuk (solomiyak@google.com) wrote: Hi,Thanks for reaching out.
