## Summary

- Technical support request for Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL) implementation that was completed but not functioning properly
- Offline conversion data import via Google Sheets failed due to timestamp format errors despite following tech team guidance
- Multiple escalations through Google representatives (Solomiya, Ally, Patrick) resulted in confusion over case assignment and meeting invitations
- Client (National Design Academy via Roksys agency) requesting follow-up technical meeting to troubleshoot code and conversion data
- Original Google rep (Solomiya) out on extended leave until end of June, causing handover issues

## Key Insights

- Enhanced Conversions for Leads implementation requires careful coordination between agency, client, and Google tech team - communication breakdown can stall progress significantly
- Timestamp format errors in offline conversion imports are a common technical issue that requires direct tech team involvement to resolve
- Google support case management can become fragmented when primary rep is unavailable - clear case numbers and client IDs are essential for continuity
- Post-implementation technical validation meetings are critical before declaring ECL setup complete - testing should be part of the implementation process

Hi Ally

Thisis dragging on now, I’d really like to get this resolved for my client.

The issue is that we need someone from the tech team to have a meeting with us to talk through the implementation of the Enhanced conversions for leads tagging that has already been done but does not appear to be working. I received an invite from the tech team but it was not specified for which client the meeting was for.

Can we please get this resolved.

Thanks

Peter

    Hi Patrick

An update for you - Henry received an email from support which was a cut and paste explanation of what needs to be done. We have already had a meeting with your guys in which it was explained what was required and now we are in a position for the tech guys to test it. Thesis a follow on from the tech guys previous call so it would be get the same person on a call.

Regards

Peter

    Hi Patrick

We’re really confused here as we’ve had nothing. I have received a tech invite from somebody on case number

7-5170000038434

but Henry was not invited and there was no client id quoted so I don’t even know if it was pertaining to National Design Academy

Could you check from your side please

 Regards, Peter

 Hey Peter and Henry,
Lovely to e-meet you both and thank you Ally for looping me in. 

I just created a case on Solomiya's behalf.  You should be receiving a link through which you can book a time slot shortly. 

Do please let me know if you don't receive that or have any queries between now and then, happy to support. 

All the best!

Patrick

    Hi Ally

In Solomiya’s absence are you able to help me with the implementation of Enhanced Conversions For Leads for my client. 

Solomiya set a meeting up for myself and Henry at the National Design Academy and following on from that the code and conversion action have been implemented. The first import of offline conversion data via the Gsheet has failed due to errors in the timestamp. The format is as had been discussed with the tech team.

What would be great is to have another call where we can check the code and the offline conversion data, can you arrange this?

Thanks

Peter
