## Transcript

how to use AI to like get deeper into personas which again I think is a really good use of AI. We can't trust AI to give us exact correct answers but we can expect it to kind of get to you know the aggregate center and so that becomes really valuable when we're trying to do say audience research because it can just kind of give us that approximation pretty quickly. Um, and so in in the context of putting together let's say an ad or a message or even just thinking through who our audience is, if we ask like who might be interested in this category, who would be interested in the brand specifically? Who would be interested in the category but not the brand? I love that question of AI because it helps to arrive at essentially the anti- audience. Like these are people who are going to respond to the category but aren't going to be your buyers. and you can create messaging that excludes them so they're less likely to click in the first place. It's not going to be appealing to them. And again, that's when especially when Google is trying to, you know, get those clicks, like being really specific and saying this isn't for you can be a real benefit to better protect your budget and keep the wrong clicks from happening.
