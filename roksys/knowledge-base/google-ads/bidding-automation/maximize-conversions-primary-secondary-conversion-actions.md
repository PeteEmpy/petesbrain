## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>So I have this account that I have run for 1 month and set it on Maximize clicks. Now, I have 2 conversion 1 for those who click the demo and another 1 for those who successfully scheduled a demo.</p> <p>I was able to hit the 30 conversions although it was dominated by the click on demo and for the next month i have changed the bidding to maximize conversion and turned the click demo into secondary conversion. Will my campaign optimize for the successfully scheduled demo? or it won't use any historical data since I turned the click demo to secondary? Will maximize conversion works?</p> <p>Any thoughts will be helpful.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Willing-Interview40"> /u/Willing-Interview40 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqc5p9/micro_conversions_for_maximize_conversion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqc5p9/micro_conversions_for_maximize_conversion/">[comments]</a></span>
