## Message

No worries, thanks for the update. Would you be free tomorrow at any point?

Just noting a few things below, some food for thought:

Few observations: Blue shares how much you are capturing, orange and
purple is how much you missed out on ... but I like to view it from the
perspective that it's a good thing, there is so much opportunity to feast
on (but I'm sure you know this anyway). The reason being is that it shows
there is so much more volume out there to capture if that is something that
you are in a position to go after.

Taking even the orange piece of the graph, do you think that would be an
option for you and/or does the client have an appetite to gain these extra
opportunities in the lead up to peak?

Turning our attention to only the US market, sharing some insights for ROAS
delivered as well as the opportunities out there to capture more volume at
a profitable level.

Based on this, do you think this is something that the customer would be
interested in; putting some more budget behind these campaigns over the
coming days (I would suggest 20% if possible as this is what our data is
showing, although I know you have set budgets)? It would be great to hear
your thoughts and context on this data if it is valuable.

Let me know re tomorrow as soon as you can, so we can speak about this.
