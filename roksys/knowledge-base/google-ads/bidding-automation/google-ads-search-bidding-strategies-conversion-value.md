# Search Campaign Bidding Strategies: Maximising Profit vs Conversions

**Source**: Google Ads Official Support
**Category**: Google Ads
**Relevance Score**: 9/10

## Summary

Research clarified a critical distinction in Search campaign bidding strategy selection. **Maximize Conversion Value is available for Search campaigns** (not just Shopping/P Max as commonly assumed), but the choice between Maximize Conversions, Target CPA, and Maximize Conversion Value depends entirely on your business optimisation goal: maximising conversion volume at a fixed cost, or maximising profit/revenue.

For e-commerce businesses (like Clear Prospects), using Maximize Conversion Value optimises for profit/revenue, not just conversion count, provided conversion value tracking is properly configured.

## Key Findings

### Available Bidding Strategies for Search Campaigns

Three main options for Search campaigns:

**1. Maximize Conversions**
- Goal: Get as many conversions as possible within budget
- Metric: Conversion count (volume)
- Best for: Campaigns where all conversions have equal value
- Sets bids to maximize conversion count, not profit

**2. Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**
- Goal: Get as many conversions as possible at a target cost per conversion
- Metric: Fixed cost per conversion (e.g., £10/conversion)
- Best for: When you know profitable CPA threshold
- Balances volume and cost discipline

**3. Maximize Conversion Value** ✅ (Available for Search)
- Goal: Maximize total conversion value (revenue/profit) within budget
- Metric: Total value generated (e.g., £ revenue)
- Best for: When conversions have varying value (high-ticket vs low-ticket products)
- Can include optional Target ROAS to ensure profitability

### Maximize Conversion Value - Details

**Availability**:
- ✅ Search campaigns
- ✅ Demand Gen campaigns
- ✅ Shopping campaigns (alternative to Target ROAS)
- ✅ Performance Max (as Maximize Conversion Value strategy)

**Requirements**:
- Conversion value tracking must be properly configured
- Historical conversion data to train the algorithm
- Conversion values should vary (otherwise use Maximize Conversions)

**Two Operating Modes**:
1. **Without Target ROAS**: Spends budget to maximise total conversion value
2. **With Target ROAS**: Gets as much conversion value as possible while maintaining target ROAS (e.g., 350% return)

## Business Context: Clear Prospects Case Study

**Current situation**: Clear Prospects has Search campaigns using Maximize Conversion Value bidding.

**Strategic question**: Is this optimal given their business model?

**Answer**: YES, if:
- Conversion values are properly tracked (e.g., order value, not just "1 per conversion")
- Business goal is to maximize profit/revenue, not just conversion count
- Different products have different values (which they do: HSG, WBS, BMPM have different margins)

**Why NOT Maximize Conversions**:
- Would optimise for volume without considering profit
- Could bid heavily on low-margin conversions
- Ignores that a £100 order is more valuable than a £20 order

**Why NOT Target CPA alone**:
- Requires predicting fixed cost-per-conversion threshold
- Less flexible when conversion values vary significantly
- Maximise Conversion Value with Target ROAS is more sophisticated

## Critical Distinction: Profit Optimization vs Volume Optimization

This research revealed a fundamental misunderstanding: **the choice of bidding strategy directly reflects business optimisation priorities**.

- **Maximize Conversions** = Volume-focused (get as many as possible)
- **Target CPA** = Cost-discipline focused (stay within cost threshold)
- **Maximize Conversion Value** = Profit-focused (maximise revenue/profit)

For retailers with varying product values and profit margins, Maximize Conversion Value (with or without Target ROAS) is strategically superior because it accounts for the fact that some conversions are worth more than others.

## Recommendations

For Clear Prospects specifically:

1. **Verify conversion value tracking** - Confirm that `conversion_value` is properly configured for all campaigns (should reflect order value, not just count)

2. **Consider adding Target ROAS** - If they want to ensure minimum profitability threshold (e.g., "spend £1 to make £3.50 in revenue" = 350% ROAS), enable Target ROAS within Maximize Conversion Value

3. **Segment by product/margin** - High-margin products (potentially HSG photo items) vs lower-margin products (WBS bulk items) might benefit from different strategies or ROAS targets

4. **Compare to industry benchmarks** - Use Adalysis research to validate: at 200+ conversions/month per campaign, they should be using sophisticated bidding (not basic Maximize Conversions)
