## Summary

- Google account manager identified significant missed impression share opportunities (shown in orange/purple vs blue captured share) indicating untapped market potential
- US market data shows profitable ROAS performance with room for volume expansion at current efficiency levels
- Google recommends 20% budget increase for peak season based on data analysis showing opportunity to capture more volume profitably
- Meeting rescheduled to discuss budget expansion strategy and review performance insights ahead of peak trading period
- Focus on immediate action needed as recommendations are time-sensitive for peak season preparation

## Key Insights

- Significant untapped opportunity exists in impression share data - the 'orange and purple' missed impressions represent volume that could be captured with increased budget allocation
- US market specifically showing strong ROAS delivery while still having capacity for expansion, suggesting campaigns are healthy and ready to scale
- Google's 20% budget increase recommendation is data-driven based on their auction insights, though acknowledges existing budget constraints
- Timing is critical - recommendations positioned for 'lead up to peak' and 'coming days', suggesting urgency for Q4/holiday season optimization
- The persistent follow-up from Google rep (multiple meeting attempts) indicates this is likely a high-priority strategic opportunity worth serious consideration
