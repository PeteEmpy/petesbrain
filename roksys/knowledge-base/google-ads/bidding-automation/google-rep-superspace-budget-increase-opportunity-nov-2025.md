## Summary

- Google Account Manager Jasmine Chauhan identifies significant untapped market share opportunity for Superspace, with analysis showing more volume available than currently being captured
- US market data reveals profitable ROAS performance with potential to scale campaigns at current efficiency levels
- Recommendation to increase budget by 20% in lead-up to peak season to capture missed opportunities shown in orange/purple segments of market share analysis
- Meeting rescheduled due to client emergency; follow-up requested for next day to discuss scaling strategy

## Key Insights

- Market share visualization shows Superspace is capturing only a portion (blue) of available demand, with significant missed opportunities (orange/purple) representing untapped volume
- US market specifically shows strong ROAS delivery with headroom to scale profitably - Google data suggests 20% budget increase could capture additional volume at similar efficiency
- Timing is critical as this is positioned as a pre-peak season opportunity, suggesting seasonal demand patterns should inform budget allocation decisions
- Google's proactive account management includes data-driven recommendations with specific percentage increases rather than open-ended scaling suggestions

## Message

No worries, thanks for the update. Would you be free tomorrow at any point?

Just noting a few things below, some food for thought:

Few observations: Blue shares how much you are capturing, orange and
purple is how much you missed out on ... but I like to view it from the
perspective that it's a good thing, there is so much opportunity to feast
on (but I'm sure you know this anyway). The reason being is that it shows
there is so much more volume out there to capture if that is something that
you are in a position to go after.

Taking even the orange piece of the graph, do you think that would be an
option for you and/or does the client have an appetite to gain these extra
opportunities in the lead up to peak?

Turning our attention to only the US market, sharing some insights for ROAS
delivered as well as the opportunities out there to capture more volume at
a profitable level.

Based on this, do you think this is something that the customer would be
interested in; putting some more budget behind these campaigns over the
coming days (I would suggest 20% if possible as this is what our data is
showing, although I know you have set budgets)? It would be great to hear
your thoughts and context on this data if it is valuable.

Let me know re tomorrow as soon as you can, so we can speak about this.
