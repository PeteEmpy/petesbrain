## Transcript

For lead genen, it's a little different. It's like, all right, they're looking at this service. Let's maybe show them products about this service. But you set up different goals. Like, if someone's gone to the website and hasn't contacted you, then you could just show them more general ads. But if someone has contacted you and hasn't signed up for a client, you could show testimonials and reviews. So, you make all these different audiences in Google Analytics, import them into Google Ads, and but you have to set up custom audiences and multiple audiences. And don't just serve everyone the same ad. Serve each audience different ads because some people are going to be upperfunnel, but middlefunnel, bottom of the funnel, and each one of those is not going to want the same messaging. If you just send everyone the same messaging, it's better than nothing. I would still recommend that than not doing remarketing, but it's not going to be as efficient and you're going to be wasting money and bleeding money
