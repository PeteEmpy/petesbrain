## Summary

- B2B consulting company spent $3,389 on Google Ads and $180 on LinkedIn with zero form conversions
- High CTR (6.47% Google, 1.07% LinkedIn) but no conversions suggests post-click issues
- 1,179 clicks to landing page with no form submissions indicates landing page or offer problem
- Conversion tracking appears properly implemented but no recorded conversions
- CEO lacks PPC expertise and marketing manager unable to diagnose issue

## Key Insights

- High CTR without conversions indicates strong ad-to-audience mismatch or landing page failure
- B2B consulting services require significant trust-building - cold traffic rarely converts immediately
- Form-only conversion funnels in high-consideration B2B services often fail without nurture sequences
- Generic 'consulting' messaging likely attracting wrong audience or setting incorrect expectations
- Proper conversion tracking implementation doesn't guarantee conversions if offer/market fit is poor
