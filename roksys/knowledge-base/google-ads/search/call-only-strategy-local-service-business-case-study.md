## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>A close friend of mine has a small local Auto Repair shop, and he's trying to get more calls to his shop.</p> <p>His website and landing pages are not good at all, and he is not looking to make any website changes.</p> <p>His GBP is surprisingly good, with 40+ good reviews, but it could use some more content and updates.</p> <p>I'm thinking about running an ad on Google with phone calls as the goal, which directs straight to his GBP, or bypasses the need for landing pages like a call-only ad.</p> <p>I don't believe LSA for auto repair is an option in my area at the moment.</p> <p>What is the best/cheapest way to go about this on a budget of around $40/day?</p> <p>So far, I'm considering doing Search linked to his GBP hoping to get his GBP to show up among the sponsored GBP's for local queries. But I'm considering call only.</p> <p>For context: I am an aspiring marketer who is building his portfolio hoping to get an agency job. I have experience running shopping ads for ecom, and search ads for dental, but I want to make sure I'm doing this right.</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Charming-Tradition-1"> /u/Charming-Tradition-1 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqcnwn/google_ads_for_a_mechanic_with_bad_landing_pages/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqcnwn/google_ads_for_a_mechanic_with_bad_landing_pages/">[comments]</a></span>
