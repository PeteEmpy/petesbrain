### Transcript

And when I broke it down from demand genen and separated them into two campaigns, one for images and one for videos, I saw the images were getting like a $5 CPA, whereas the videos were getting like 25 $30. So I realized the videos either something's wrong with these videos that I need to fix these videos or maybe I should just pause the videos and just go all in in these images. And then when I did the images even more, I was able to drop it down to $2 per lead. But if I just lumped it all together, I probably might have gotten it down to like $15 a lead, but I wouldn't have been able to scale it back so much because you have to really piece it apart and pick and choose and see what's what's converting and what's not converting and thin the herd. Cut out what's not converting. That way you're just not wasting money on those clicks. Yeah, makes sense.
