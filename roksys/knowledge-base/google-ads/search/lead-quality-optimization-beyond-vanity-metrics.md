## Summary

- B2B SaaS company experiences disconnect between strong metrics (CTR, engagement, demo requests) and actual revenue
- Leads show interest but don't convert to sales, suggesting audience qualification issues
- Plans to test harder qualification in ad copy, intent-based landing pages, and pipeline-focused metrics
- Highlights danger of optimizing for vanity metrics instead of business outcomes

## Key Insights

- High CTR and engagement don't guarantee revenue if ads attract unqualified or not-ready-to-buy audiences
- Optimization should focus on pipeline and revenue metrics rather than top-of-funnel vanity metrics
- Ad copy and landing pages need stronger qualification mechanisms to filter for purchase-ready prospects
- Success metrics must align with business goals (closed deals) rather than platform metrics (clicks, impressions)

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We've hit a point where our best ads aren't getting any revenue even though we have high CTR, engagement, and a good number of demo requests. </p> <p>We've built a tool that unifies your sales data and gains insights from it so that you can improve your sales plan and although people seem interested our leads just aren't closing. It's like the ads attract people who are interested but not in the market. </p> <p>So, what the heck is going wrong? Are optimizing for the wrong thing? CTR and CPC look good for the exec slide but they're not telling us who's ready to buy. </p> <p><strong>We want to test:</strong> </p> <ol> <li>Ads that qualify harder (speak directly to pain (which I thought we were doing already but clearly not well enough))</li> <li>Landing pages that mirror intent instead of generic demo CTAs</li> <li>Success metrics tied to pipeline not impressions or clicks</li> </ol> <p>How does that sound? Please let me know what else we can try? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Educational_Court906"> /u/Educational_Court906 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqurcg/our_top_performing_ads_arent_driving_reveue/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqurcg/our_top_performing_ads_arent_driving_reveue/">[comments]</a></span>

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: PPC lead quality optimization and conversion alignment
**Reason**: This article addresses a critical PPC challenge highly relevant to Google Ads practitioners: the disconnect between vanity metrics (CTR, CPC) and actual revenue/conversion quality. It discusses actionable strategies like better audience qualification, landing page optimization, and shifting to pipeline-focused metrics, though it lacks specific Google Ads tactical implementation details.
