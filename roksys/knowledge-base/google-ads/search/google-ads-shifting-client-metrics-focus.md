## Transcript

And I know that's kind of a big thing in agencies as well. Like so often a client comes in and they have a benchmark from what the last agency did or how their in-house team did and they've looked at all these metrics like CTR, clicks, average CPC. How how do you get your clients to maybe refocus on the the business metrics that actually matter? >> No, I always tell I mean those are all vanity. Looking at impressions, clicks is what most my clients look at when they first start running ads. And I tell them this doesn't really tell you much. You got to look at conversions. How many people are signing up or calling you or emailing you or phone, whatever that conversion goal is. Setting up conversion tracking because if we're not tracking conversions, then it's not going to be too helpful unless you're just looking for awareness. Most businesses don't want awareness. They want conversions. And that's where we got to look at that bottom of the funnel and how to get those conversions
