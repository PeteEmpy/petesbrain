## Summary

- High click-through rates (CTR) don't always correlate with campaign success - focusing on qualified clicks is more important than maximizing total clicks
- Impression-based metrics and qualified traffic can lead to stronger ROI and conversion rates compared to chasing high CTR vanity metrics
- Strategic approach to CTR optimization should prioritize conversion quality over click volume to reduce wasted ad spend
- Challenges conventional PPC wisdom by demonstrating when lower CTR indicates better targeting and audience qualification

## Key Insights

- CTR should not be treated as a primary success metric - qualified clicks from the right audience matter more than high click volumes that may include unqualified traffic
- Lower CTR can indicate better ad targeting and pre-qualification, filtering out clicks from users unlikely to convert and reducing wasted budget
- Focusing on impression share and qualified traffic strategies leads to more efficient spending and better conversion rates than optimizing purely for CTR
- Campaign success should be measured by downstream metrics (conversions, ROI, CPA) rather than top-of-funnel engagement metrics like CTR
