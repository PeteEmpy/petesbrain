## Summary

- Meeting rescheduled to Monday afternoon due to Peter's client priorities
- Superspace campaigns showing superb performance, exceeding ROAS targets
- Client (Superspace) approved carte blanche budget increases for US campaigns while maintaining ROAS targets
- Australia campaign budgets slightly relaxed, UK market remains budget-constrained
- Regular monthly sync between Google account team and agency (Roksys)

## Key Insights

- Strong campaign performance has built client confidence, leading to increased budget flexibility - demonstrates the value of maintaining ROAS targets
- Market-specific budget strategies: US has full flexibility, Australia partially relaxed, UK remains constrained - suggests different market maturity or opportunity levels
- Client relationship is strong enough to give agency autonomy on budget decisions within ROAS parameters
- Regular account management touchpoints (monthly syncs) maintain alignment between Google, agency, and client
