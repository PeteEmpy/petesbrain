- Common tension between algorithmic automation and advertiser-observed performance patterns
- Gradual implementation of scheduling changes may be preferable to sudden campaign restrictions
- Highlights fundamental challenge of limited manual controls in fully automated campaign types

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Running lead gen with PMax and search 24 hour/day. Every night around 8pm, conversions drop off but Google keeps spending budget until midnight (and the campaigns lose most of its daily profit in those late hours).PMax doesn’t allow bid adjustments by hour like standard Search.</p> <p>1.would ad scheduling hurt if i made a daily pause from 8 pm to 6am?</p> <p>2.if not, should i do it gradually over a specific duration like cut one more hour every day starting by 11pm and 1am to reach 8pm and 6am after a few days? or just cut to 8pm and 6 am on the first day.</p> <p>Anyone has any other way to reduce or stop evening budget waste in PMax campaigns without hurting learning/pacing? Any workarounds or advanced tactics that actually help? Open to all ideas, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/solar_sphinx92"> /u/solar_sphinx92 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqoj03/pmax_spends_budget_after_8pm_but_no_leadshow_do/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqoj03/pmax_spends_budget_after_8pm_but_no_leadshow_do/">[comments]</a></span>
