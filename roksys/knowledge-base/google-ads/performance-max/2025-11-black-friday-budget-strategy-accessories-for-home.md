## Summary

- Google Account Strategist Lucy Loughlin provides pre-Black Friday insights showing early holiday shopping purchases per week are higher than 2024 (2.07 vs 1.57)
- Critical budget pacing issues identified - main campaigns overspending daily budgets and under-serving, with specific campaigns flagged for priority budget increases
- Gift cards forecast to represent 39% of total holiday budgets (+12% YoY), with search peaks on Dec 23-24
- November Saturdays identified as crucial battleground generating $1.3B per day average
- Meeting rescheduled to Thursday Nov 7 at 11am to review AI Max campaign performance

## Key Insights

- Campaign budget limitations during peak season will reduce conversion capture - prioritize budget increases for overspending campaigns immediately
- Gift card offering could extend revenue opportunity through Christmas Eve when traditional product searches decline
- Higher purchase frequency per shopper (32% increase) suggests stronger buyer intent requiring adequate campaign budgets to capitalize
