## Summary

- Peter had to cancel monthly sync with Google due to client emergency
- Major positive update: Superspace client granted carte blanche to increase US campaign budgets
- Current performance is 'superb' and well within ROAS targets
- Australia campaign budget also relaxed, UK remains constrained
- Meeting rescheduled for Monday afternoon

## Key Insights

- Strong campaign performance earning client trust - 'carte blanche' on US budget increases as long as ROAS targets maintained
- Different budget strategies by market: US (flexible), Australia (relaxed), UK (constrained)
- Client prioritization sometimes requires rescheduling Google rep meetings - acceptable in relationship
- Google reps willing to accommodate rescheduling when informed of legitimate reasons
