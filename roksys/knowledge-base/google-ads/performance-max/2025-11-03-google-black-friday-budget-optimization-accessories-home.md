## Summary

- Early 2025 holiday shopping shows higher purchase frequency (2.07 purchases/week vs 1.57 in 2024)
- November Saturdays generate $1.3B/day average, representing crucial conversion opportunities
- Gift cards forecast to represent 39% of holiday budgets (+12% YoY)
- Client campaigns overspending daily budgets, causing intentional under-serving that will worsen through November
- Budget reallocation needed immediately to capture incremental conversions during critical 4-week period

## Key Insights

- Campaign budget limitations are causing lost impression share - several campaigns are overspending daily budgets and will become increasingly limited during peak holiday period
- Gift card category showing significant growth (39% of budgets, +12% YoY) with search peaks on Dec 23-24, presenting opportunity if client doesn't currently offer
- November Saturdays are critical battleground days generating significantly higher revenue than typical Saturdays, requiring sufficient budget allocation
- Higher purchase frequency per shopper (2.07 vs 1.57) indicates increased buying intent, making budget constraints more costly in terms of missed conversions
