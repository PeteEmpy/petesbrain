## Summary

- Google Account Manager Jasmine Chauhan identifies significant untapped opportunity in Superspace campaigns, with data showing substantial missed impression share (orange and purple segments vs. blue captured share)
- US market analysis reveals profitable ROAS with capacity to scale - Google recommends 20% budget increase to capture additional volume at profitable levels heading into peak season
- Missed sync meeting due to client emergency; follow-up scheduled to discuss campaign scaling strategy and budget allocation
- Performance data suggests current campaigns are efficient but budget-constrained, leaving revenue opportunities on the table

## Key Insights

- Significant missed opportunity: Visual data shows substantial orange/purple segments representing uncaptured impressions, indicating room for growth without compromising efficiency
- US market specific insights show profitable ROAS performance with capacity to scale - campaigns are performing well but limited by budget constraints
- Google's data-driven recommendation: 20% budget increase would capture additional volume at profitable ROAS levels, particularly important for upcoming peak season
- Strategic timing: Pre-peak period presents optimal window to test budget increases and capture market share before competition intensifies

No worries, thanks for the update. Would you be free tomorrow at any point?

Just noting a few things below, some food for thought:

Few observations: Blue shares how much you are capturing, orange and
purple is how much you missed out on ... but I like to view it from the
perspective that it's a good thing, there is so much opportunity to feast
on (but I'm sure you know this anyway). The reason being is that it shows
there is so much more volume out there to capture if that is something that
you are in a position to go after.

Taking even the orange piece of the graph, do you think that would be an
option for you and/or does the client have an appetite to gain these extra
opportunities in the lead up to peak?

Turning our attention to only the US market, sharing some insights for ROAS
delivered as well as the opportunities out there to capture more volume at
a profitable level.

Based on this, do you think this is something that the customer would be
interested in; putting some more budget behind these campaigns over the
coming days (I would suggest 20% if possible as this is what our data is
showing, although I know you have set budgets)? It would be great to hear
your thoughts and context on this data if it is valuable.

Let me know re tomorrow as soon as you can, so we can speak about this.
