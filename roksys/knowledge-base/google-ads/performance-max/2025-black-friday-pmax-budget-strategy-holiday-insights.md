## Summary

- Early holiday shopping in 2025 shows higher purchase frequency (2.07 vs 1.57 purchases/week) compared to 2024
- November Saturdays are critical, generating $1.3B per day average, significantly higher than non-Q4 Saturdays
- Gift cards forecasted to represent 39% of total holiday budgets (+12% YoY), with peak searches on Dec 23-24
- Performance Max campaigns are overspending daily budgets and will under-serve without budget increases during the critical 4-week period
- Budget pacing issues identified requiring prioritization of specific campaigns to capture incremental conversions

## Key Insights

- Campaign budget limitations will intensify through November without intervention - campaigns spending above daily budgets will intentionally under-serve to stay within monthly allocations
- Gift card strategy represents significant opportunity with 39% of holiday budgets and peak demand on Dec 23-24, suggesting need for dedicated campaigns or product offerings
- November Saturdays are disproportionately valuable revenue days requiring adequate budget allocation to capitalize on concentrated shopping behavior
- Higher purchase frequency (31% increase YoY) indicates more engaged shoppers, supporting case for increased budget investment to capture additional transactions
