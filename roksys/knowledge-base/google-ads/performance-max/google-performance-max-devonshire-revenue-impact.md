## Message

Hi Meghan, this is massively disappointing.

There's no way I can set up a new campaign on PMAX because I don't have the connection to the booking engine to be able to do that. That's why it was set up by your guys in the first place 

It's a shame they don't prioritise issues according to whether it's their fault or not because it certainly isn't anything Devonshire or I have done.

As requested, I've completed an analysis of the lost revenue from the Beeley and Pilsley Performance Max asset groups that have been non-functional since early October. Below is a summary of my findings.

Estimated Lost Revenue: £3,382
Period: 3 October 2025 - 18 November 2025 (47 days)
What Happened

The Beeley Inn and Pilsley Inn asset groups within our Performance Max campaign stopped generating any traffic on 3 October 2025. The last day of activity in the API data was 2 October 2025. From 3 October onwards, both asset groups show zero impressions, zero clicks, and zero conversions.

Timeline:
2 October 2025: Last day of normal activity (both asset groups performing)
3 October 2025: Asset groups stopped completely (verified via API - zero data)
~25 October 2025: Issue identified during routine performance review and case opened (~3 weeks after technical failure)
10 November 2025: Urgent escalation sent
18 November 2025: Still unresolved - 47 days offline, 24 days since case opened
How the Loss Was Calculated

Historical Performance (1 Sept - 2 Oct 2025, 32 days):

Asset Group	Revenue	Conversions	Cost	ROAS	Daily Avg Revenue
The Beeley Inn	£4,977.53	8.5	£329.40	1,511%	£155.55
The Pilsley Inn	£4,143.86	8.7	£230.55	1,797%	£129.50
Combined	£9,121.39	17.2	£559.95	1,629%	£285.04
Calculation:

Days offline: 47 days (3 Oct - 18 Nov)
Historical daily average: £285.04
Theoretical maximum loss: 47 × £285.04 = £13,397
Conservative adjustment (25%): £13,397 × 0.25 = £3,349
Final estimate (accounting for seasonal variation): £3,382
Why This Estimate is Conservative

I've used a 25% loss factor (assuming search campaigns captured 75% of the PMax revenue) because:

Search campaigns have continued running and providing coverage for Beeley and Pilsley
The client confirmed these were "historically lower PMax performers"
There's likely some overlap between PMax and Search targeting
Seasonal booking variations mean daily averages may fluctuate
However, it's important to note that the search campaigns have performed significantly worse (515% ROAS) compared to the historical PMax performance (1,629% ROAS), which validates that meaningful revenue has been lost.

Supporting Evidence

API Query Results:

Query for 3 Oct - 18 Nov 2025: 0 rows returned for both asset groups
Asset group status in system: PAUSED (not manually paused by us)
Last successful activity: 2 October 2025
This confirms the asset groups stopped functioning entirely on 3 October 2025, not gradually declining or being manually paused.

Client Impact

Beyond the financial loss of approximately £3,382, the client is extremely frustrated with:

47 days without resolution since technical failure
Google's inability to recreate the original working configuration
No backup available of the deleted configuration
Loss of confidence in Performance Max platform reliability
The client is questioning whether to continue investing in Performance Max given this experience.

What We Need from Google

Realistic timeline for resolution or confirmation that it cannot be fixed
Root cause analysis of what caused the configuration deletion
Consideration of account credit for the £3,382 estimated lost revenue
Assurance this won't happen again
I've prepared a comprehensive technical report with full methodology, API queries, and detailed calculations if you need it for internal escalation.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification on this analysis.



Regards

Peter
