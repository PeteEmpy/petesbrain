## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there :)</p> <p>We had this big PMAX campaign (Feed/Shopping only) running smoothly for ~2 years now.</p> <p>We only made minor changes in TROAS% with +/- 20-30% due to performance.</p> <p>Last month is was running as usual. No changes in anything. Performing and spending great.</p> <p>But the 1th of November everything changed.</p> <p>The CPC dropped with 80% from one day to another. That might sound great, but the conversionrate also dropped with about 80%, and are performing nowhere near the TROAS% anymore. We are now 6 day into November, and all days are the same. Extremely cheap CPC, but almost no sales.</p> <p>The click:interaction rate is the same, so it is not because of display or anything (which shouldnt happen on a feed only neither).</p> <p>Keywords are still the same, relevant ones.</p> <p>But what are Google doing here? Its really strange.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TomatilloRoutine6025"> /u/TomatilloRoutine6025 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ops4rf/what_is_happening_to_pmax/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ops4rf/what_is_happening_to_pmax/">[comments]</a></span>

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Performance Max campaign troubleshooting and unexpected performance changes
**Reason**: This is a specific Google Ads Performance Max campaign issue that's highly relevant to practitioners, but it's a user question without answers or resolution. While it describes a real problem (sudden CPC and conversion rate drops), it lacks actionable insights, diagnosis, or solutions that would make it valuable for a knowledge base.
