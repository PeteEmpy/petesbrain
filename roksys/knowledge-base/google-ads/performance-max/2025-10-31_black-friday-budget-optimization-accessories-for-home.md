## Summary

- Early holiday shopping in 2025 shows higher purchase frequency (2.07 vs 1.57 purchases/week in 2024) despite comparable overall volume
- November Saturdays are critical revenue drivers, generating average $1.3B per day compared to typical Q4 Saturdays
- Gift cards projected to represent 39% of total holiday budgets (+12% YoY), with search volume peaking Dec 23-24
- Main campaigns are overspending daily budgets and under-serving to maintain monthly allocation, requiring urgent budget adjustments
- Google recommends prioritizing budget increases for campaigns showing highest overspend to capture incremental conversions during critical 4-week period

## Key Insights

- Budget constraint issue: Campaigns are intentionally under-serving due to daily budget overspend, which will worsen as November progresses and demand increases
- Strategic opportunity: Gift card offerings could capture late-season demand with searches peaking in final days before Christmas
- Performance trend: 32% increase in weekly purchase frequency YoY indicates stronger buyer intent and potential for higher conversion volumes
- Timing critical: November Saturdays represent disproportionate revenue opportunity requiring full budget availability
- Tactical priority: Budget reallocation needed immediately to high-performing campaigns shown in pacing report to avoid missing conversion opportunities

Hi Peter,

No problem at all, I will reschedule for next week. *Would Thursday at 11am
work for you?*

In the meantime and before we go into the weekend, I wanted to share some
key insights from Google for this week which I hope are of interest as
Black Friday is fast approaching:



   -

   Early holiday shopping is comparable to last year, with the exception
   that the average number of purchases per week is higher than last year
   (2025: 2.07 vs. 2024: 1.57)
   -

   November Saturdays are a crucial battleground: they generated an
average $1.3
   billion per day, than the average Saturday outside of Q4
   -

   Gift cards are set to be a major category, representing a forecasted 39%
   of total holiday budgets (+12% y/y)


A tactical insight & recommendation from me for Accessories for the Home
(797-299-4730 <(727)%20493-6686>) - Some of our main campaigns are spending
more than their daily budget and as a result will intentionally under-serve
to stay within the monthly budgetary allocation. This will likely continue
to a greater extent as we move further into November. Below is a budget
pacing report showing how much % your campaigns overspent on budget
yesterday:

To avoid campaigns becoming limited in the next critical 4 weeks, when
increasing budgets, I'd recommend prioritising the above campaigns to
ensure they will have enough breadth to capture all of the expected
incremental conversions.

On the gift card front - I'm not sure if mentioned whether or not
Accessories for the Home offer them, but it's definitely something to
consider to drive strong performance right up to Christmas Day as we see
'Gift Card' searches peak on the 23rd-24th of December.

Any questions please let me know. Looking forward to connecting next week.

All the best,
Lucy
