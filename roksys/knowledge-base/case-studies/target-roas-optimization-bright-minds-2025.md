# Case Study: Target ROAS Optimization - Bright Minds Search Brand Campaign

**Client**: Bright Minds
**Campaign Type**: Search Brand
**Date**: November - December 2025
**Result**: 48% increase in conversions, ROAS maintained 15% above target
**Status**: ✅ Proven Success

---

## Executive Summary

This case study documents a highly successful Target ROAS optimization for Bright Minds' Search Brand campaign. By reducing the Target ROAS from an unrealistic 800% to a more achievable 550%, we delivered:

- **+48% increase in conversions** (2.6 → 6.1 daily)
- **632% ROAS maintained** (15% above new target)
- **+3.7pp impression share improvement** (89.3% → 93.0%)
- **+27% daily spend increase** (appropriate for volume gained)

**Key Learning**: Unrealistic Target ROAS settings restrict Google's bidding algorithm, limiting volume at profitable ROAS levels. Setting achievable targets allows the algorithm to optimize effectively.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Situation

**Campaign**: BMI | Search | Brand (high-intent brand search traffic)
**Issue**: Target ROAS set at 800% was preventing volume growth
**Actual Performance**: 510-600% ROAS (consistently below target)
**Gap**: 289pp between target and actual performance

### Why This Was a Problem

1. **Algorithm Restriction**: Google's algorithm was being overly cautious
2. **Lost Volume**: Conservative bidding meant missed brand search opportunities
3. **Unrealistic Target**: 800% ROAS target had no business justification
4. **Missed Revenue**: Brand searches going to competitors instead

### Client Context

- **Business Type**: E-commerce (Educational Toys & STEM Products)
- **Monthly Budget**: £1,000 management fee + ad spend
- **Account Age**: Recently onboarded (October 2025)
- **Previous Performance**: Strong ROAS but limited volume
- **Impression Share**: 89.3% (losing 10%+ of brand searches)

---

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify the Issue

**Question**: Why is a high-performing brand campaign not scaling?

**Investigation**:
- Campaign consistently delivered 510-600% ROAS
- Target ROAS set at 800% (no clear rationale)
- Impression share at 89% (leaving volume on table)
- Bid strategy: Target ROAS (Smart Bidding)

**Diagnosis**: Target ROAS too high → Algorithm overly cautious → Volume restricted

### Step 2: Research Best Practices

**Target ROAS Guidelines**:
- Should be set at **actual performance level or slightly below**
- Ideal gap: 50-100pp below actual ROAS (allows optimization room)
- Overly aggressive targets restrict volume
- Brand campaigns typically can maintain strong ROAS at higher volumes

**Decision Framework**:
```
IF actual_roas > (target_roas + 200pp) THEN
    target_roas is TOO HIGH
    Algorithm is being RESTRICTED
    Action: REDUCE target to allow growth
```

### Step 3: Calculate New Target

**Previous State**:
- Target: 800%
- Actual: 510-600%
- Gap: 200-290pp (TARGET TOO HIGH)

**New Target Calculation**:
- Recent actual ROAS: 510%
- Add 40pp buffer: 510% + 40% = 550%
- New target: **550% ROAS**

**Rationale**:
- Achievable (actual performance 510-600%)
- Room for algorithm to optimize (not restrictive)
- Still maintains strong profitability
- Allows volume growth

### Step 4: Set Success Criteria

**Expected Outcomes** (documented in task):
- ✓ Conversion volume: +20-40% increase
- ✓ ROAS performance: Maintain 500%+ ROAS
- ✓ Impression share: Maintain or improve 91.8%
- ✓ Spend increase: +£15-30/day expected
- ✓ Conversion quality: No degradation

**Review Period**: 14-day learning period + post-learning analysis

## Success Factors

### Why It Worked

1. **Accurate Diagnosis**
   - Correctly identified unrealistic target as the constraint
   - Data supported the hypothesis (289pp gap)

2. **Evidence-Based Decision**
   - Used actual performance data (510-600% ROAS)
   - Set new target based on achievable benchmarks
   - Added modest buffer (40pp) for safety

3. **Clear Success Criteria**
   - Documented expected outcomes before change
   - Set specific review checkpoints
   - Defined "success" quantitatively

4. **Proper Review Process**
   - Waited for 14-day learning period
   - Analyzed post-learning performance separately
   - Accounted for seasonal effects (Black Friday)

5. **Strong Brand Campaign Foundation**
   - Brand search = high intent, strong conversion rates
   - Lower funnel traffic = more predictable performance
   - Good campaign structure already in place

---

## Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways

1. **Target ROAS Should Be Achievable**
   - Set at or slightly above actual performance
   - Gap >200pp indicates target is too restrictive
   - Algorithm needs room to optimize

2. **Brand Campaigns Can Scale Profitably**
   - Brand search traffic is high-quality
   - Can maintain strong ROAS at higher volumes
   - Don't artificially restrict volume with aggressive targets

3. **Learning Period Performance Misleading**
   - First 14 days show erratic behaviour
   - ROAS may temporarily dip
   - Spend may spike as algorithm explores
   - **Always review POST-learning performance**

4. **Document Expected Outcomes**
   - Set clear success criteria before change
   - Makes review objective and measurable
   - Prevents post-hoc rationalization

5. **Consider Seasonal Effects**
   - Black Friday week (Nov 25-29) affected learning period
   - Post-learning period (Dec 5-16) more reliable
   - Separate baseline from seasonal uplift

### Warning Signs to Watch

**When Target ROAS is TOO HIGH**:
- ✗ Actual ROAS consistently >200pp below target
- ✗ Impression share <90% on brand campaigns
- ✗ Auction insights show strong position but limited volume
- ✗ Conversion volume stagnant despite profitability

**When Target ROAS is TOO LOW**:
- ✗ ROAS consistently hits target exactly (no buffer)
- ✗ Quality metrics declining (AOV, conversion rate)
- ✗ Profitability concerns from client
- ✗ Overspending budget without proportional results

---

## Replication Guide

### When to Apply This Strategy

**Ideal Candidates**:
- ✓ Brand search campaigns (high-intent traffic)
- ✓ Target ROAS >200pp above actual performance
- ✓ Strong impression share opportunity (<95%)
- ✓ Consistent profitability demonstrated
- ✓ Client comfortable with volume-focused growth

**Not Suitable For**:
- ✗ Generic search campaigns (performance may vary)
- ✗ Campaigns already at optimal volume
- ✗ Clients with strict budget caps
- ✗ New campaigns still in initial learning phase
- ✗ Poor conversion tracking or data quality

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Phase 0: Context Check (5 mins) ⚠️ CRITICAL - ADDED DEC 17, 2025

**⚠️ Lesson from Superspace analysis error: Always check client context BEFORE data analysis**

1. **Check Client CONTEXT.md FIRST**
   - Read `clients/{client}/CONTEXT.md`
   - Review "Current Issues" section
   - Review "Strategic Context" section
   - Look for: Stock constraints, budget limitations, known restrictions

2. **Verify Pattern Is Not Intentional**
   - Is low impression share by design?
   - Are there documented business constraints?
   - Is the client deliberately restricting volume?

3. **Only Proceed If:**
   - No documented constraints exist
   - Low impression share is not intentional
   - Pattern appears to be unaddressed optimization issue

**Example of when NOT to proceed**: Superspace (Dec 2025) showed 40-44% impression share, but CONTEXT.md documented stock shortage requiring intentional budget reductions. Low impression share was DELIBERATE constraint management, not an optimization opportunity.

**Key principle**: Context before conclusions. Data patterns without context can be misleading.

---

#### Phase 1: Analysis (1 hour)

1. **Pull Performance Data** (Last 30 days)
   ```sql
   SELECT
     campaign.name,
     metrics.cost_micros,
     metrics.conversions_value,
     metrics.search_impression_share
   FROM campaign
   WHERE campaign.id = [CAMPAIGN_ID]
     AND segments.date >= '[30_DAYS_AGO]'
   ```

2. **Calculate Key Metrics**
   - Average ROAS (last 30 days)
   - Current Target ROAS setting
   - Gap between target and actual
   - Average impression share

3. **Diagnose Issue**
   - If gap >200pp: Target too high
   - If impression share <90%: Volume opportunity exists
   - If ROAS consistent: Performance reliable

#### Phase 2: Planning (30 mins)

4. **Calculate New Target**
   ```
   new_target = actual_roas + 50pp buffer
   ```
   Example: 510% actual → 560% target

5. **Set Success Criteria**
   - Expected conversion volume change: +20-40%
   - Expected ROAS: Maintain current level ±10%
   - Expected impression share: Improve or maintain
   - Expected spend increase: Calculate based on volume

6. **Document Decision**
   - Record current performance
   - Record new target and rationale
   - Set review date (14 days after change)

#### Phase 3: Implementation (15 mins)

7. **Make the Change**
   - Google Ads UI > Campaign Settings
   - Update Target ROAS
   - Rename campaign to reflect change date
   - Example: "Brand | 550 ROAS | 20Nov"

8. **Notify Client**
   - Explain rationale
   - Share expected outcomes
   - Set review checkpoint

#### Phase 4: Review (2 hours)

9. **Wait for Learning Period** (14 days minimum)
   - Algorithm re-optimizes bids
   - Performance may be erratic
   - Don't panic if ROAS dips temporarily

10. **Pull Review Data** (After learning period + 7 days)
    - Pre-change period (14 days before)
    - Learning period (14 days after change)
    - Post-learning period (7+ days after learning)

11. **Compare Performance**
    - Conversion volume change
    - ROAS performance
    - Impression share change
    - Spend increase
    - Quality metrics (AOV, conversion rate)

12. **Make Decision**
    - If successful: Keep new target
    - If mixed results: Adjust target slightly
    - If unsuccessful: Revert and diagnose root cause

## Client Communication

### Before the Change

**Email Template**:

```
Subject: Bright Minds - Brand Campaign Optimization Opportunity

Hi [Client Name],

I've identified an opportunity to increase conversion volume on your
brand search campaign while maintaining strong profitability.

Current Situation:
• Campaign achieving 510-600% ROAS consistently
• Target ROAS set at 800% (overly restrictive)
• Impression share at 89% (missing 11% of brand searches)

Recommendation:
• Reduce Target ROAS from 800% → 550%
• This will allow Google to bid more aggressively on brand terms
• Expected: 20-40% increase in conversions
• Expected: ROAS maintained above 500%

The current 800% target is preventing the algorithm from capturing
available brand search volume. The new 550% target is still highly
profitable and will allow growth.

I'll implement this on [DATE] and review results after the 14-day
learning period on [REVIEW_DATE].

Any questions or concerns?

Regards,
[Your Name]
