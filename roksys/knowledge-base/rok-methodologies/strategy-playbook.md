## Proven Wins (Ready to Roll Out)

### 1. Product-Specific Performance Max Campaigns

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED - Ready for rollout

**Original Test:**
- **Client:** Smythson UK
- **Date:** Oct 28, 2025
- **Change:** Split Diaries product line into standalone PMax campaign (separate from main H&S campaign)

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- Diaries have distinct AW25 seasonality (peak Sept-Dec)
- Product line represents significant revenue percentage
- Different ROAS profile than blended account average
- Need dedicated budget control for seasonal category

**Hypothesis:**
- Better budget allocation during peak season
- Clearer performance signals (not blended with other products)
- Expected: +10% diary revenue, improved ROAS tracking

**Test Results:**
- **Review Date:** [Nov 11, 2025 - pending]
- **Actual Outcome:** [To be filled after review period]
- **Statistical Significance:** [TBD]

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Product line represents >15% of total account revenue
- Product has distinct seasonality different from account average
- Product ROAS differs significantly (>20%) from blended account ROAS
- Product requires dedicated budget during peak periods

**Rolled Out To:**
- Smythson UK ✓ (Oct 28, 2025)
- Smythson USA (planned)
- Smythson EUR (planned)

**Rollout Candidates:**
- Tree2mydoor: Christmas trees (seasonal peak)
- Superspace: High-performing furniture categories
- Any e-commerce client with distinct product lines

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify product line with distinct performance/seasonality
- [ ] Create standalone PMax campaign
- [ ] Set dedicated budget based on historical performance
- [ ] Move/create asset group for product line
- [ ] Set baseline ROAS target (use historical if available)
- [ ] Monitor for 14-28 days
- [ ] Compare to blended performance in original campaign

### 2. Category-Based Asset Group Segmentation

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED - Ready for rollout

**Original Test:**
- **Client:** Smythson UK
- **Date:** Oct 2025
- **Change:** Created category-specific asset groups in PMax H&S campaign

**Asset Groups Created:**
- Jewellery Boxes and Rolls
- Stationery
- Card Holders
- Travel Bags
- Notebooks

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- Different product categories have different margins and AOV
- Category-specific creative and messaging improves relevance
- Better performance visibility by category
- Google's algorithm can optimize for category-specific signals

**Hypothesis:**
- Higher-margin categories (Travel Bags, Card Holders) will show stronger ROAS
- Category-specific assets improve CTR and conversion rate
- Better insight into which categories drive performance

**Test Results:**
- **Review Date:** [Nov 11, 2025 - pending]
- **Actual Outcome:** [To be filled]
- Based on early signals: Travel Bags and Card Holders showing strong performance

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Client has 5+ distinct product categories
- Categories have different price points/margins
- Large enough product catalog to support multiple asset groups
- Want granular performance visibility

**Rolled Out To:**
- Smythson UK ✓ (Oct 2025)

**Rollout Candidates:**
- Tree2mydoor: Segment by tree type/size
- Superspace: Segment by furniture category
- Any multi-category e-commerce with diverse catalog

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Audit product catalog for natural category groupings
- [ ] Identify 5-8 primary categories (not too many)
- [ ] Create asset groups with category-specific names
- [ ] Use category-specific product page images in assets
- [ ] Write category-specific headlines/descriptions
- [ ] Monitor performance by asset group for 30 days
- [ ] Identify top performers for potential standalone campaigns

## Tests in Progress (Monitoring)

### Smythson Diaries - Standalone PMax Campaign

**Started:** Oct 28, 2025
**Review Date:** Nov 11, 2025
**Status:** 🟡 MONITORING

**What Changed:**
- Created "SMY | UK | P Max | Diaries" campaign
- Moved Diaries asset group from main H&S campaign
- Set dedicated budget for seasonal control

**Hypothesis:**

### Smythson Category Asset Groups

**Started:** Oct 2025
**Review Date:** Nov 11, 2025
**Status:** 🟡 MONITORING

**What Changed:**
- Created 5 category-specific asset groups in H&S campaign
- Categories: Travel Bags, Card Holders, Notebooks, Stationery, Jewellery Boxes

**Hypothesis:**
- Category-specific assets improve relevance and ROAS
- Better performance visibility by category
- High-margin categories will outperform blended average

**Early Signals:** [To be added as data comes in]

## Failed Tests (Avoid Repeating)

### Blanket ROAS Reduction Across All Campaigns

**Client:** Smythson
**Date Proposed:** Oct 28, 2025
**Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (superseded by better strategy)

**Original Plan:**
- Reduce ROAS targets by 15% across ALL Smythson campaigns
- Goal: Increase volume heading into Q4

**Why It Would Have Failed:**
- Ignores regional performance differences (UK ROAS 4.3 vs USA 2.5)
- Blanket approach doesn't account for market maturity
- Risk of unprofitable volume in lower-performing regions
- No strategic differentiation

**Better Alternative (What We Did Instead):**
- Regional ROAS targets based on market performance
- UK: Higher ROAS target (mature market, strong performance)
- USA: Lower ROAS target (growth market, building volume)
- EUR/ROW: Baseline targets for newer markets

**Learning:**
- One-size-fits-all approaches ignore account complexity
- Regional/product-level strategies beat blanket changes
- Always segment by performance before adjusting targets

## Strategy Patterns Library

### When to Split Products into Standalone Campaigns

**Use When:**
- Product revenue >15% of account total
- Distinct seasonality pattern
- ROAS differs >20% from account average
- Need dedicated budget control

**Don't Use When:**
- Product revenue <10% (too small to justify)
- No performance difference from blended average
- Insufficient conversion volume for Google's algorithm

---

### When to Create Category-Specific Asset Groups

**Use When:**
- 5+ distinct product categories
- Categories have different margins/AOV
- Large product catalog
- Want granular performance insights

**Don't Use When:**
- <3 product categories (not worth segmenting)
- Categories too similar in performance/pricing
- Small catalog (<50 products)

---

### When to Use Regional ROAS Targets

**Use When:**
- Operating in 3+ geographic markets
- Clear performance differences between regions (>20% ROAS variance)
- Different market maturity levels (established vs growth)

**Don't Use When:**
- Single market only
- Regional performance is consistent
- Insufficient data per region

## How Experiments Are Tracked

Each experiment goes through this lifecycle:

1. **Proposal** → Logged in ROK Experiments sheet with:
   - What's changing
   - Why (strategic reasoning)
   - Expected outcome (hypothesis with numbers)
   - Review timeline

2. **Implementation** → Added to client CONTEXT.md under "Active Tests"
   - Review task created
   - Google Ads changes logged in change history

3. **Monitoring** → Listed in "Tests in Progress" section above
   - Early signals noted
   - Any issues flagged

4. **Review** → After specified timeline:
   - Query performance data (actual vs expected)
   - Update ROK Experiments sheet with outcomes
   - Move in CONTEXT.md to "Completed Tests"

5. **Decision:**
   - **Success** → Add to "Proven Wins", create rollout tasks
   - **Failure** → Add to "Failed Tests" with learnings
   - **Mixed** → Iterate or retest with modifications

## Rollout Prioritization Framework

When a test succeeds, evaluate rollout candidates:

**High Priority (Roll out immediately):**
- Same client, different regions (e.g., Smythson UK → USA)
- Similar business model and product structure
- High confidence of replication

**Medium Priority (Test with modifications):**
- Different client, similar product structure
- May need adaptation for market/catalog differences
- Test on smaller scale first

**Low Priority (Consider for future):**
- Requires significant customization
- Client not ready (budget, capacity, business priorities)
- Uncertain applicability
