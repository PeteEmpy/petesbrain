## Summary
Critical brand guidelines for Smythson ad copy to ensure consistency across paid social and PPC campaigns.

## Brand Guidelines for Ad Copy

### Text Capitalization
- **Use sentence case** (not all lowercase) for paid social and PPC
- Be consistent across all ad formats
- Example: "Luxury leather goods" NOT "luxury leather goods"

### Company Age References
- **Say "137 years"** or **"over 135 years"** (not other variations)
- Reasoning: More accurate and consistent with other communications
- This reflects the actual age of the company

### Brand Name Usage
- **Brand name is "Smythson"** (NOT "Smythson London")
- Never append "London" to the brand name in copy
- Keep brand name simple and consistent

### US Market Spelling
- **Use American English spelling** for US campaigns and asset groups
- Common changes:
  - "z" instead of "s" (e.g., "personalize" not "personalise", "customize" not "customise")
  - "or" instead of "our" (e.g., "color" not "colour")
  - "er" instead of "re" (e.g., "center" not "centre")
  - Single "l" (e.g., "traveling" not "travelling")
- This applies to all ad copy, headlines, descriptions, and asset group content targeting the US market

## Application

When creating ad copy for Smythson:
1. Check capitalization - use sentence case throughout
2. Reference company age as "137 years" or "over 135 years"
3. Use "Smythson" as the brand name (no location suffix)
4. **For US campaigns**: Use American English spelling (z not s, or not our, etc.)

## Importance

These guidelines are critical for maintaining brand consistency across all paid advertising channels. Non-compliance may result in ad copy requiring revision.
