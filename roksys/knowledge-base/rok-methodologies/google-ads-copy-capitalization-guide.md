# Google Ads Copy Capitalization Best Practice Guide

## Summary

Based on 2024-2025 research analyzing over 1 million Google Ads, **sentence case for both headlines and descriptions** is now the recommended best practice for Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) and Performance Max asset groups.

## Key Guidelines

### ✅ Recommended: Sentence Case (Modern Best Practice)

**Definition**: Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns (brand names, place names, product names).

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Luxury leather goods handcrafted in Britain"
- ✅ "Smythson diaries made with Italian leather"
- ✅ "Shop our Christmas collection online today"

**Applies to**:
- Headlines (short and long)
- Descriptions
- Sitelinks
- Callout extensions

### Why Sentence Case Performs Better

Recent performance data (2024-2025) shows sentence case outperforms title case on key metrics:

1. **Higher ROAS** - Better return on ad spend
2. **Lower CPA** - More efficient cost per acquisition
3. **Higher CTR** - Improved click-through rates

**Reason**: Sentence case appears more natural and resembles organic search results, which users perceive as higher quality content.

### ⚠️ Avoid: Title Case (Old Best Practice)

**Definition**: Capitalize the first letter of every major word.

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Luxury Leather Goods Handcrafted In Britain"
- ❌ "Shop Our Christmas Collection Online Today"

**Why avoid**: While this was the traditional best practice (especially for ETAs - Expanded Text Ads), modern RSAs and Performance Max campaigns perform better with sentence case.

**Exception**: Some brands may still prefer title case for brand consistency. Discuss with client if their style guide requires it.

### ❌ Never Use: ALL CAPS or Inconsistent Capitalization

**Prohibited by Google Ads**:
- ❌ "FREE SHIPPING" (all caps - policy violation)
- ❌ "FrEe ShIpPiNg" (inter-capitalization - policy violation)
- ❌ "LUXURY leather GOODS" (inconsistent - looks unprofessional)

**Exception**: Acronyms are allowed (e.g., "UK", "VAT", "NHS", "B2B")

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Copywriters

When writing Google Ads copy:

1. **Use sentence case by default** for all headlines and descriptions
2. **Capitalize proper nouns** (Smythson, London, Christmas, etc.)
3. **Capitalize acronyms** (UK, EU, VAT, B2B, etc.)
4. **Keep everything else lowercase**

### For Copy Review

When reviewing ad copy, check:

1. ✓ First word capitalized
2. ✓ Proper nouns capitalized
3. ✓ All other words lowercase
4. ✗ No random mid-sentence capitals
5. ✗ No ALL CAPS (except acronyms)
6. ✗ No inconsistent mixing

### For Client Communication

When clients ask about capitalization:

1. **Explain the research** - 1M+ ads analyzed, sentence case performs better
2. **Show the benefits** - Better CTR, ROAS, CPA
3. **Explain why** - Looks more natural, resembles organic results
4. **Be flexible** - If brand guidelines require title case, discuss trade-offs

## ROK Standard

**Effective November 2025**:
- All Google Ads copy (RSAs, Performance Max asset groups) should use **sentence case** unless client specifically requests otherwise
- All automated copywriting tools (Google Ads Text Generator) should generate sentence case by default
- All skills and agents should follow this guideline

## Examples by Asset Type

### Callouts
