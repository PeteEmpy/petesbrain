## Summary

- Meeting coordination between Google Account Manager (Luiza Arruda) and Roksys client representative (Peter Empson) for two client accounts
- Original meeting scheduled for November 6th was postponed due to client emergency at Roksys
- Meeting successfully rescheduled to Monday, November 8th at 2 PM to discuss both Accessories for the Home and Uno Lights accounts
- Google team proposed consolidating two separate account meetings into one combined call to save time during busy period

## Key Insights

- Flexible rescheduling and understanding from Google team demonstrates strong client relationship management
- Two active Google Ads accounts being managed: Accessories for the Home and Uno Lights, both requiring strategic review
- The timing (early November) suggests Q4/holiday season planning discussions, as referenced by Peter's comment 'I think Christmas is coming!'
