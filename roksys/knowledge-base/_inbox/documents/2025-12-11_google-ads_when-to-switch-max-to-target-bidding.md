## Summary

Adalysis analysed 16,825 search campaigns to determine when advertisers should transition from Max Conversions to Target CPA, and from Max Conversion Value to Target ROAS. The study reveals data-driven benchmarks based on actual account behaviour rather than Google's historical thresholds (which required 300 conversions/month for Target CPA).

The research found that median conversion thresholds are more reliable than averages, as high-performing campaigns skew the data. Key findings: campaigns typically shift to Target CPA around 30+ conversions per month, while Target ROAS adoption becomes more common at 73+ conversions and £9,000+ monthly revenue.

## Key Takeaways

- **Target CPA threshold**: Campaigns with 30+ conversions per month are more likely to use Target CPA than Max Conversions
- **Target ROAS threshold**: Campaigns need at least 73 conversions per month and £9,000+ monthly revenue to reliably use Target ROAS
- **Revenue benchmarks**:
  - Under £4,000/month: Use Max Conversion Value
  - £4,000-£9,000/month: Both strategies used equally
  - £9,000-£24,500/month: Target ROAS increasingly common
  - Over £24,500/month: Target ROAS becomes primary strategy
- **Data quality matters**: Google's machine learning has improved dramatically—you no longer need 300 conversions/month, but each campaign has its own threshold based on keyword count and historical consistency
- **Median > Average**: Using median conversions is more reliable than averages, as top performers skew the numbers
- **Brand/non-brand separation**: Segmenting brand and non-brand campaigns ensures benchmarks reflect true behaviour (brand campaigns inflate averages)

## Relevance to Business

This is a critical reference for advising clients on bidding strategy transitions. The data-driven benchmarks provide concrete thresholds to recommend changes, moving beyond "it depends" to specific conversion and revenue targets. Particularly valuable for e-commerce clients evaluating Target ROAS adoption and for managing client expectations around when automation becomes viable.
