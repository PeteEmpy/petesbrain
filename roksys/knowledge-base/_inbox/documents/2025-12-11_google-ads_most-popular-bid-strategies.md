**Source**: Adalysis

**Category**: Google Ads

## Summary

Adalysis analysed 16,825 Google Ads search campaigns to identify which bidding strategies advertisers actually use and when. The research reveals distinct patterns based on conversion volume, campaign type (brand vs non-brand), and data availability. Max Conversions dominates low-data environments, while Target CPA and Target ROAS adoption increases significantly with conversion volume. Brand campaigns show dramatically different patterns, with 80% using Target CPA or Target ROAS bidding.

The research demonstrates that brand campaigns can skew analysis by 3-7x, highlighting the critical importance of segmenting brand and non-brand campaigns for accurate benchmarking.

## Key Takeaways

**Non-Brand Campaigns (by adoption rate)**:
- Max Conversions: ~40% (most common for low-conversion campaigns)
- Target CPA: ~25% (second most common)
- Max Clicks: ~15% (surprisingly high)
- Manual CPC: ~9%
- Max Conversion Value: ~7%
- Target ROAS: ~4%

**Campaigns with No Conversion Data**:
- Max Conversions: Most common (despite lack of data)
- Max Clicks: Second choice for those wanting automation
- Manual CPC: ~13%
- Target Impression Share: Notably higher than in conversion-enabled campaigns

**Brand Campaigns**:
- Target CPA: ~60% (dominant)
- Target ROAS: ~20%
- Max Conversions: ~8%
- Target Impression Share: ~5%
- Overall: 80% of brand campaigns use Target CPA or Target ROAS

**Critical Pattern**: Once campaigns exceed 1,000 conversions per month, Target CPA bidding is preferred (>50% adoption) regardless of brand/non-brand status.

**Why This Matters**:
- Brand campaigns inflate average conversions by 3-7x, making segment separation essential for accurate benchmarking
- Low-conversion campaigns (typical for many advertisers) rely on Max Conversions as safe default
- Data quality directly correlates with bid strategy sophistication
- Many advertisers use Target CPA/ROAS without sufficient conversion tracking, which won't work accurately

## Relevance to Business

This is essential industry context for client onboarding and strategy recommendations. Shows what typical advertisers are doing (vs what they *should* be doing), helping you position clients strategically. Particularly valuable for understanding why many clients default to Max Conversions despite having better options, and why brand/non-brand segmentation is critical for accurate analysis.

The data on campaigns without proper conversion tracking is especially relevant for identifying tracking issues during audits.
