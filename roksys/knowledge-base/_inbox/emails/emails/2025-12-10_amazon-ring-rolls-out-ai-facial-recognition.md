## Amazon Ring rolls out AI facial recognition

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Amazon’s Ring is rolling out “Familiar Faces,”** an AI-powered facial recognition feature** for its video doorbells across the United States. The tool allows users to build a catalog of up to 50 faces for personalized alerts, and it **drew immediate criticism from privacy advocates,** given Ring’s history of security failures and law enforcement partnerships.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The “Familiar Faces” feature lets users create a private library of faces, allowing the system to send **custom notifications like “Mom at Front Door”** instead of a generic alert that a person was detected.

* Privacy groups like the EFF and U.S. Senator Ed Markey have opposed the feature, citing Ring’s previous **$5.8M FTC fine for lax security** and its history of sharing footage with police departments.

* Due to existing biometric privacy laws, the feature **will not launch in Illinois, Texas, or Portland, Oregon**. Amazon states that the collected facial data is encrypted and is not used to train its AI models.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This rollout places a **powerful surveillance tool directly into consumer hands**, intensifying the debate over data privacy and corporate responsibility. For companies developing consumer AI, this is a case study in reputational risk. **Deploying features that use sensitive biometric data**, especially without fully resolving past security concerns, can provoke immediate regulatory backlash and erode public trust.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI cut data reporting time from weeks to seconds

* **Burger King France**, a chain with nearly 600 restaurants, struggled to give teams quick usage to reliable operational and data.

* The issue came from **fragmented systems and manual reporting**, which slowed insights and shortened agility across marketing, finance, and restaurant operations.

* Partnering with Artefact, Burger King introduced **REBEKA**, a generative AI chatbot that** converts natural-language questions into SQL queries** for data retrieval.

* Teams **get answers in seconds instead of weeks**, improving decision speed, boosting productivity, and strengthening the company’s data-driven culture.
