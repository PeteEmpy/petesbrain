## White House halts executive order to override state AI laws

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

The White House has paused a draft executive order that would have allowed** the federal government to preempt state AI laws** **through lawsuits and funding restrictions**. The proposed order, backed by President Trump, aimed to unify national AI regulation but **faced immediate bipartisan backlash** from state officials and lawmakers.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The draft would have created an **“AI Litigation Task Force” under Attorney General Pam Bondi **to challenge state AI laws on constitutional and federal preemption grounds.

* It also proposed directing the Department of Commerce to review state AI regulations and potentially **withhold broadband funding** **from states with restrictive AI policies.**

* Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers condemned the move, **calling it an overreach that would undermine state protections** against fraud, deepfakes, and child exploitation imagery.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

The pause **highlights growing tension** **between federal ambitions to unify AI policy and state efforts to regulate AI harms locally.** For businesses, the outcome could determine whether compliance remains a fragmented state-by-state challenge or shifts toward a single national framework. The decision will shape how AI companies plan **governance, risk, and deployment strategies **across the US.

**Case Study**

## How AI cut frontline response time from 4 minutes to 3 seconds

* **Rumo**, Brazil’s largest freight rail operator,** needed to give 1,700 train drivers **access to safety procedures without 4 kg of printed manuals.

* Paper-based updates were **slow and error-prone.** Drivers had to halt trains and ring supervisors for confirmation, delaying operations and increasing risk.

* **The company launched** **RUTI Maquinista**, an AI app built on Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI, and SharePoint to deliver secure, real-time data.

* The result: **response times fell from four minutes to three seconds,** 1.3M pages saved yearly, and ROI was **achieved in under two months.**

## Google pushes back on Gmail AI training rumors

* Google **denies reports** that it uses Gmail messages and attachments to train AI models, responding to viral posts claiming users need to disable **"smart features"** to prevent their emails from being used for AI training.

* **Google spokesperson Jenny Thomson** clarified that the company has not changed any settings and **does not use Gmail content for training** its Gemini AI model. 

* The confusion stems from Gmail's smart features, which enable spell checking, shipment tracking, and calendar integration. These **require entry to email content for functionality,** but differ from AI model training according to Google.
