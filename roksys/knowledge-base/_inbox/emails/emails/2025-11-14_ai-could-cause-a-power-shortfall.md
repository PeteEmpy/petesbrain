**Welcome back. **OpenAI and the New York Times are beefing. On Wednesday, the [AI firm slammed the copyright lawsuit](https://openai.com/index/fighting-nyt-user-privacy-invasion/) brought against it by the newspaper and other news organizations, urging the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to reverse an order that would force it to cough up 20 million user chats, calling the request an “overreach.” [In a filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.640396/gov.uscourts.nysd.640396.742.0_1.pdf), the company argued that “more than 99.99%” of the chats have nothing to do with the case, and that these chats should instead be treated like private emails.

AI firms continue planning astronomical AI infrastructure. But can the US power supply hack it? 

Anthropic has joined the slew of AI firms investing billions in massive data centers throughout the US. On Wednesday, the company announced that it would invest $50 billion in [American AI infrastructure](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-invests-50-billion-in-american-ai-infrastructure), starting with data centers in Texas and New York, in partnership with Fluidstack. 

Anthropic joins OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Softbank and more in the race to develop these sites and evolve its AI models. But the power demands of these data centers may exceed the power grid’s capacity. 

In a note published earlier this week, [Morgan Stanley analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-20-shortage-135922617.html) warned that AI demand could leave the US with a “power shortfall totaling as much as 20%” for data centers through 2028, reaching a deficit of up to 13 gigawatts. 

Though tech leaders claim that the need for compute is the biggest problem facing the evolution of AI, energy supply and grid reliability present an even greater risk. The problem is that the building and deploying of these colossal server farms is far, _far _outpacing utility companies’ ability to upgrade the grid, [Sebastian Lombardi](https://www.daypitney.com/professionals/l/lombardi-sebastian-m/), chair of the energy and utilities practice at law firm Day Pitney, told The Deep View.

While the problem is currently deepest felt in “pockets” of the US that have high concentrations of data centers, it’s only a matter of time before the stress on the grid and energy demand are felt all over the country, he said, possibly resulting in issues [with reliability](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security) and [affordability for utility payers](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5597971/electricity-bills-utilities-ai). The rapid pace and magnitude of these buildouts are leaving utility companies and regulators scrambling to play catch-up.

“The AI data center story has complicated things. It’s created some questions about how we are going to maintain reliability,” said Lombardi. “The amount of energy that is expected to be used to power that infrastructure is quite significant.”

Caption: 

Despite the issue at hand, tech firms show no signs of tempering their all-out sprint. The solution might be what Lombardi calls an “all of the above” strategy for increasing the energy supply. This means a sharper focus on renewable energy, as well as more stakeholders buying into the “renaissance” that nuclear power is having. Even moonshot ideas, such as [Google’s space-based Suncatcher](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/google-targets-space-based-ai-infrastructure) data centers, could be worth exploring. “We all want the lights to stay on,” said Lombardi. “We may have to get away from picking winners and losers if we're going to meet the pace and the magnitude of demand.”

However, how much help these tech companies will be in [solving the problem that they're effectively causing](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/climate/tech-companies-climate-goals.html), especially as many [struggle with their net-zero goals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2024/08/29/why-big-corporations-are-quietly-abandoning-their-climate-commitments/), is still unclear.

# AI works better with proprietary data

As large, foundational models get larger and larger, they start to act the same. The differentiator is in the data. 

[Alembic Technologies](https://getalembic.com/), a San Francisco-based AI lab, is dedicated to solving the problem of AI homogeneity, making models that are actually distinct from one another, founder and CEO Tomas Puig told The Deep View. 

“As we see the capabilities of these models converge … this creates a very large problem for corporations,” said Puig. “While I think generalized intelligence is really good, where we've really focused on is building the best intelligence in the world from private data sets.” 

The startup, which develops custom AI models for enterprises using their proprietary data, announced [a $145 million Series B funding round](https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/13/alembic-technologies-raises-145m-buys-nvidia-powered-supercomputer-accelerate-causal-ai/). The round multiplies the company’s valuation more than 15-fold, bringing it to $645 million, Puig said. 

Alembic’s focus lies specifically in causal AI models, or those that think using cause and effect. 

* For example, using a company’s own data, a causal model may analyze which kinds of marketing perform best for a company and why those tactics do well. 

* “The benefits of the cause and effect side of the house is you actually know what you can affect and what you cannot, what is worth pursuing and what's not worth pursuing,” Puig said. 

Additionally, Alembic announced that it is deploying a DGX AI Supercomputing cluster running the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite. The architecture, to be constructed in California, marks the company’s second such cluster, the first being in Virginia. Given that it’s building models with private and sensitive data, owning its own hardware is key in ensuring privacy, Puig said. 

“For our clients at their security level, they want to know that literally anything we compute never leaves our own private house,” said Puig. “We work with the type of data that nobody in the world wants to give somebody else access to.”

# Cursor hits $30 billion valuation

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/65111c57-5dc8-4738-8219-7e25e2ad41ca/ART3__0-00-00-00___53_.jpg?t=1763115303)
Caption: 

AI-powered coding is proving to be one of the most lucrative use cases for the tech. And Cursor is raking it in. 

On Thursday, the company announced a $2.3 billion funding round, boosting its valuation to $29.3 billion, up from [$2.5 billion in January.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/dealbook/anysphere-cursor-25-billion-valuation.html) The round was led by Accel, with new investors including Google and Nvidia joining in, signalling that tech giants see no signs that AI coding tools are going anywhere. 

Cursor has bloomed over the past year as companies began [automating the work of young coders](https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Canaries_BrynjolfssonChandarChen.pdf). The startup’s platform has drawn [more than one million users](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/cursor-an-ai-coding-assistant-draws-a-million-users-without-even-trying), and counts [tech heavyweights](https://cursor.com/customers) like OpenAI, Stripe and Adobe as customers. According to the Wall Street Journal, it’s turned down multiple acquisition offers from major companies. The company also said it has surpassed [$1 billion in revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/13/cursor-ai-startup-funding-round-valuation.html). 

The platform allows users to toggle in between different AI models as they code, including those by Anthropic and OpenAI, and includes an autoselect feature that picks the right model for the job.

* However, it may be seeking to bring AI in-house: In late October, the company launched [Composer](https://cursor.com/blog/2-0), its own in-house coding model, built for low-latency agentic coding and capable of completing most tasks in 30 seconds or less.  

* In a [post on X earlier this week](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/1988702166295670858), the company published its popular and fastest-growing models on its platform as of November. Claude Sonnet 4.5 topped the list for popularity, with Composer coming in second and GPT-5 in third. 

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/1988702166295670858)

The company’s investors told the Wall Street Journal that the company’s main objective is to add more users, and CEO Michael Truell said that AI model companies remain “important partners to us.” 

But in boosting usage of its proprietary AI model, the company may be able to actually keep some of its revenue, rather than forking it over to major model providers like Anthropic, OpenAI and Google.
