Hi Peter,

I hope you have a well deserved break coming up over the festive period!
Sharing below some final insights before I am OOO on Friday:

We’re expecting to see large demand this coming ‘’Super Saturday’’ as well
as a jump in activity for Boxing day. These two days generally offer the
last chance to close out the year strongly. Furthermore, on average CPCs
are 3% lower in December compared to November, offering strong volume
paired with cheaper CPCs.

The main action is to review key campaigns and ensure they have enough
investment to capture any incrementality this weekend, as well as from
Boxing Day onwards, to close out 2025 on a high.

On a separate note, I wanted to let you know that Accessories for the Home
will have a new Account Manager, Jasmine, as of the New Year. As I'm
sure you know, we periodically update account managers to ensure you are
receiving the best support and a fresh pair of eyes.

I will leave it to you both to arrange a suitable time to connect. It was a
pleasure working with you and I wish you all the best!

All the best,
Lucy
