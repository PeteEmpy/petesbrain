## RSL 1.0 standards make AI firms pay for scraped content

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

The RSL Collective has officially launched Really Simple Licensing 1.0 (RSL), a web standard that allows publishers to dictate licensing and compensation rules to AI companies used to train AI. **Over 1,500 media organizations currently support RSL**, including major publishers like The Associated Press, Vox Media, The Guardian, and BuzzFeed, with web infrastructure giants Cloudflare and Akamai backing the implementation.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* RSL expands the existing robots.txt framework, giving publishers **granular control over AI usage** while maintaining traditional search visibility, solving Google's current all-or-nothing approach to AI opt-outs.

* Major web infrastructure providers like Cloudflare and Akamai can **automatically block non-compliant AI scrapers** that refuse to pay licensing fees, giving RSL enforcement power beyond voluntary compliance.

* The standard arrives as Google faces a **European Commission antitrust investigation** for using publisher content in AI search features without offering publishers the ability to refuse such usage.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This move gives publishers long-sought leverage over how their content is used in AI products. It could **reshape negotiations between media companies and AI developers**, especially as the European Commission investigates Google’s use of publisher data in AI search results.

Fortune Magazine interviewed Innovating with AI’s founder to discuss a crazy stat – AI engineers are being deployed as consultants at $900/hr. 

Why did they interview Rob? 

Because he’s already trained 1,000+ AI consultants  – and IWAI’s exclusive consultant directory has driven Fortune 500 leads to graduates.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI cut bid prep time for contractors

* **Bob the Builder AI**, a US startup for small construction firms, faced slow manual bidding that delayed projects and reduced profit margins.

* The challenge stemmed from **paper-based estimating and compliance tasks**, which created backlogs and prevented contractors’ ability to compete for work.

* The team built an **AI assistant that drafts bids, reviews contracts, and auto-fills compliance forms** using natural language processing.

* Early users report **significant time savings and faster bid turnaround**, helping contractors secure more projects and improve workflow.

## Figma adds AI image editing tools

* Figma launched object removal and image expansion capabilities, aiming to **reduce switching between design tools**. The platform handles basic image edits internally rather than requiring exports to external editors.

* Figma enhanced its lasso tool for precise object selection, erasure and isolation. Users can **adjust lighting and color** while preserving background elements. An image expansion feature helps designers adapt creatives across formats by automatically filling backgrounds when converting between banner sizes.

* Figma consolidated all image editing capabilities into **a single toolbar with prominent background erasure** ability, noting it's the platform's most common tool. The tools arrive as rivals Adobe and Canva have offered similar capabilities for years, marking Figma's catch-up in AI-powered editing.
