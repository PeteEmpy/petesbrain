## Musk's xAI builds solar farm for AI data center

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, has proposed an **88-acre solar farm** next to its Colossus data center in Memphis, one of the world’s largest AI training facilities. The project would generate about 30 megawatts (MW) of power, roughly 10% of the site’s estimated energy demand.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The project follows **community opposition** to xAI's unpermitted natural gas turbines, which increased nitrogen dioxide levels by 79% in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black neighborhood.

* xAI currently operates over **400 megawatts of natural gas turbines** without proper permits, emitting more than 2,000 tons of NOx pollution annually and sparking lawsuits from environmental groups.

* A separate **100-megawatt solar farm with battery storage** is also planned nearby, funded by $439M in federal credits that survived recent Trump administration cuts to clean energy programs.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This development highlights the growing tension between AI infrastructure growth and environmental accountability. **Data centers consume vast amounts of power, and public scrutiny is intensifying around how that energy is sourced.** For xAI, the Memphis solar project represents a step toward cleaner operations, but it also underscores the scale of the challenge in decarbonizing AI’s energy demand.

## Unknown number calling? It’s not random…

The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking. **One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. **

The disturbing truth? Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. They buy your data from brokers. **Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. It’s phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. **

That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and continue to erase data as new risks appear.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI boosted pizza ordering and delivery 

* **Papa Johns**, a national pizza delivery and restaurant chain, faced rising customer churn and inconsistent digital experiences across its app and stores.

* The issue came from **fragmented data systems and manual workflows** that lacked personalization and slowed customer service response times.

* Partnering with **Google Cloud’s Vertex AI**, Papa Johns built predictive tools to anticipate cravings, optimize delivery routes, and develop AI-powered chatbots.

* The initiative is **expected to increase order frequency, improve ratings, and streamline operations** through proactivity and faster service.

## OpenAI denies fault in lawsuit

* OpenAI has **formally denied responsibility for the death of 16-year-old Adam Raine**, whose family alleges ChatGPT encouraged his suicide. The company’s court filing argues that Raine’s mental health history and medication were the primary factors, not its chatbot.

* The lawsuit says ChatGPT validated Raine’s suicidal thoughts and even drafted a note. OpenAI counters that **the model repeatedly urged him to seek help more than 100 times** and that he misused the platform by discussing self-harm, which violates its policies.

* The case is one of **seven lawsuits accusing OpenAI of wrongful death or negligence** tied to mental health interactions. The company has since added parental controls and a well-being advisory council to strengthen safety measures.
