Publicly accessible Google API key for Google Cloud Platform project  
PetesBrain (id: gen-lang-client-0000536395)



Dear customer,



We have detected a publicly accessible Google API key associated with the  
following Google Cloud Platform project:

Project PetesBrain (id: gen-lang-client-0000536395) with API key  
AIzaSyDowdeXxrfH2TLrgxfxM70_javptOVYv4U

The key was found at the following URL:  
https://github.com/PeteEmpy/petesbrain/blob/2fac7ffa4740ff6b97b8e9eec7c8e17559be9a8e/agents/youtube-monitor/add-channel.py

For a subset of abuse issues, we send abuse notifications in log format.  
Please log in to your console and review this abuse notification in Cloud  
Logging.

We believe that you or your organisation may have inadvertently published  
the affected API key in public sources or on public websites (eg  
credentials mistakenly uploaded to a service such as GitHub).

Please note that as the project/account owner, you are responsible for  
securing your keys. Therefore, we recommend that you take the following  
steps to remedy this situation:


If this key is intended to be public (or if a publicly accessible key isn't  
preventable):

Log in to the Google Cloud console and review the API and billing activity  
on your account, ensuring that the usage is in line with what you expect.
Add API key restrictions to your API key, if applicable.

If this key was NOT meant to be public:

Regenerate the compromised API key by searching for 'Credentials' in the  
Cloud console platform, editing the leaked key and using the 'Regenerate  
key' button to rotate the key. For more details, review the instructions on  
handling compromised GCP credentials.
Take immediate steps to ensure that your API keys are not embedded in  
public source code systems, stored in download directories or  
unintentionally shared in other ways.
Add API key restrictions to your API key, if applicable.


The security of your Google Cloud Platform account(s) is important to us.
