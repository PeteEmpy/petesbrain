Hi Team,

Hope you are doing well,

I see conversions are recording successfully under conversion action ( NDA
Enhanced Conversions For Leads )

The status of the conversion action shows ( Inactive ) this is a known
error which we are looking into, however this is not affecting the
conversions or the account, you can ignore this error.

Please proceed uploading recent data and email us if you have any questions
or need further help.

I will monitor the account for 7 days and close this ticket.


Sincerely,

Lokesh B
Technical Solutions Team
