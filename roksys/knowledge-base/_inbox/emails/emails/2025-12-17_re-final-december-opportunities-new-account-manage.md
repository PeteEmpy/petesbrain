Hi Peter,

Hope you're doing well & are looking forward to the fast approaching
festive period. It looks like I'll be managing two of your accounts next
year which I'm sure makes things easier for you.

I know we have a call to talk about superspace on 20th Jan at 3pm (I am OOO
until then), but if it suits you, I can extend the meeting to 45 mins long,
starting at 14.45pm so we have some time to talk about this account too?
