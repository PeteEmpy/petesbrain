## Message

Hi Peter,

I hope you're well.

I do apologise for the delay here. I have escalated this several times and
unfortunately we still do not have an update. Below you'll find the comms
from the team:* At this time, we do not have additional details or a
timeline to provide;*

*but please note that further updates may take some time as our
teamsprioritize issues according to impact.*

Have you tried starting a new campaign and seeing if it works with the new
set up?

If you could please let me know what the revenue impact of not having this
campaign working as intended has been, that would be great.

Kr,
