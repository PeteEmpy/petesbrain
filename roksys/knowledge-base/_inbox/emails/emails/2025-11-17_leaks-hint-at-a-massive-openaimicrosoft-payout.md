## Unknown number calling? It’s not random…

The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking. **One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. **

The disturbing truth? 

Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. They buy your data from brokers. Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. **It’s phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. **

That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and continue to erase data as new risks appear.

## Leaks hint at a massive OpenAI–Microsoft payout

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Leaked documents obtained by Ed Zitron show that **OpenAI paid Microsoft $865.8M in revenue share** during the first three quarters of 2025, up from $493.8M in 2024. The figures suggest OpenAI’s revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft, estimated at 20%, has scaled sharply alongside its revenue growth and compute usage.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* **OpenAI’s revenue is projected to exceed $20B annualized by year-end**, according to CEO Sam Altman, with leaked data implying at least $4.3B earned in the first three quarters of 2025.

* **Microsoft’s share represents its cut from OpenAI’s commercial products**, including ChatGPT and API, though it also pays OpenAI royalties from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service revenues.

* OpenAI’s compute **amounts have surged to roughly $8.65B in the same period**, suggesting it may still be spending more on inference than it earns in revenue.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

**The leaks highlight the interdependence between OpenAI and Microsoft, raising questions about the sustainability of AI model economics**. If OpenAI’s inference continue to outpace revenue, it could reshape investor expectations across the AI sector. The data also signals how cloud partnerships may evolve as model providers seek more balanced cost structures and transparency in future deals.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI made counting inventory eight times faster

* **Starbucks, a global coffeehouse chain, faced stock visibility issues** across many stores that caused waste, delays, and inconsistent experiences.

* Manual inventory counts were **slow and error-prone**, forcing staff to spend valuable time in backrooms instead of serving customers efficiently.

* Partnering with NomadGo, Starbucks deployed **AI-powered automated counting** using computer vision and 3D spatial intelligence to track stock accurately in real time.

* The rollout enabled inventory checks **eight times more frequently**, improving replenishment speed and keeping ingredients available.

## Anthropic highlights political neutrality during bias

* **Anthropic released tests showing Claude Sonnet 4.5 scored 94% on political even-handedness** as the Trump administration targets "woke AI" systems across the industry. 

* The announcement follows procurement rules from the White House. **President Trump bars federal agencies from buying AI systems** that "sacrifice truthfulness to ideological agendas,".

* CEO Dario Amodei defended against what he called "inaccurate," noting training for political neutrality began in early 2024. The industry faces pressure as **political bias complaints create federal procurement risks**.
