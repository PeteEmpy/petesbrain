Hi Peter,

I hope you’re having a wonderful holiday season.

I’m reaching out to share that I will continue to be your dedicated Google
Ads Account Manager for Uno Lights heading into 2026. I’ve truly enjoyed
our partnership this past year, and I’m looking forward to helping you
achieve even more in the year ahead.

*Holiday Update: *From the 22nd December*, *I will be away on annual leave
to recharge for the new year. I will be back at my desk and fully available
starting *Friday, January 9th*.

*Let’s Connect* Once I’m back, I’d love to schedule a brief catch-up to
review our goals for Q1 and ensure we’re hitting the ground running. I
provisionally added time on the *9th at 2 pm*, please let me know if that
works or feel free to book here
<https://calendar.app.google/AUJjTGCiRFPtPwTN7> at a time that suits you
best.

Wishing you a great Christmas and New Year!
