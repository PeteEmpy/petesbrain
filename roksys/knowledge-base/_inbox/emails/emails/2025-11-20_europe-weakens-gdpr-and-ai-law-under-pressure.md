## 🇪🇺 Europe weakens GDPR and AI law under pressure

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

The European Union is scaling back its landmark GDPR privacy rules and AI law under intense pressure from US tech companies and the Trump administration. The European Commission's proposed changes would **allow AI companies to use personal data** **for training models **and delay the enforcement of high-risk AI system rules scheduled for next summer.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The proposal allows AI companies to legally use personal data to train models as long as they comply with other GDPR requirements, and **simplifies the cookie permission pop-ups** that have plagued European web browsing.

* High-risk AI systems that pose "serious risks" to health, safety, or fundamental rights will get an **extended grace period** beyond next summer's original deadline, with rules applying once "needed standards and support tools are available."

* The changes come after months of pressure from US cloud and AI firms, Donald Trump, and internal EU figures like **former ECB head Mario Draghi**, who argued that burdensome regulations hamper Europe's global AI competitiveness.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This reversal marks a significant shift for the block that once led global privacy regulation. For businesses operating in Europe, these changes could **simplify data usage for AI development**, though civil rights groups are mobilizing opposition as the proposal moves through the European Parliament and states.

## Unknown number calling? It’s not random…

The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking. **One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. **

The disturbing truth? 

Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. **They buy your data from brokers. Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. **It’s phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. 

That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and **continue to erase data as new risks appear**.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI built an “always-on” supply chain

* **C.H. Robinson, a global freight and logistics provider**, faced slow shipment planning and rising fares from manual processes and disconnected systems.

* The issue came from **fragmented data and legacy workflows** that couldn’t adapt to real-time market shifts or customer demands.

* The company launched its **Agentic Supply Chain**, powered by 30+ AI agents that plan, book, and optimize shipments with predictive intelligence.

* Customers see **faster speed-to-market, proactive rerouting, and measurable cost savings**, freeing teams to focus on higher-value priorities.

## Trump considers decision to block state AI laws

* President Trump is **considering an executive decision that would block state-level AI regulations** and direct the Justice Department to challenge such laws. The move would also restrict some federal funding to states that pass what the administration calls “onerous” AI measures.

* The draft argues that **a single federal standard is needed to keep the U.S. competitive in the global AI race**. It warns that a “patchwork” of state laws could slow innovation. 

* The proposal has already **divided Republican leaders**, with some governors defending state authority to regulate AI and others backing Trump’s push for national preemption.

## Warner Music settles with Udio, signs AI agreement

* Warner Music Group ended its copyright battle with AI music startup Udio, **settling the lawsuit while signing a licensing agreement** for an AI music platform launching in 2026.

* The subscription service will let users create remixes, covers, and songs using voices and compositions from participating WMG artists like Lady Gaga, Coldplay, and The Weeknd. **Fans will create alongside artists, while rights-holders keep control and revenue.**

* This signals **licensing over litigation** as the dominant path forward. Universal and Sony are reportedly in similar talks with Udio and rival platform Suno, which raised $250M this week at a $2.45B valuation.
