## ⚖️ Trump’s AI policy faces political backlash

#### 🚨 Our Report

**President Trump’s recent executive policy on artificial intelligence** has drawn bipartisan criticism for rolling back federal oversight. The policy seeks to accelerate private-sector AI deployment.

#### 🔓 Key Points

* The policy eliminates several federal reporting requirements for large AI developers, including safety disclosures and risk assessments from previous policy frameworks. **Critics warn this could allow unsafe AI systems** to reach the public.

* **Industry groups describe the move as “pro-innovation,”** while civil rights advocates caution that weaker oversight may introduce bias or harm. The debate reflects competing priorities in AI policy.

* Lawmakers are discussing legislation to restore safety reporting and expand protections for AI researchers. **The response could reshape federal AI **oversight. Public scrutiny is expected to influence next steps.

#### 🔐 Relevance

The dispute highlights tension between innovation and accountability in US AI policy. Businesses may benefit from reduced compliance expenses. **Weaker oversight could expose firms** to recent regulatory and reputational risks.

## Unknown number calling? It’s not random… 

The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking. One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. 

The disturbing truth?

Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. 

They buy your data from brokers. 

Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. It’s** phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. **

That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and continue to erase data as new risks appear.
