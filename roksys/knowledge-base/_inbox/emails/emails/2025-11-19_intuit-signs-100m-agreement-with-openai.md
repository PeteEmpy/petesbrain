Case Study

———————————————————————————

## How Verizon boosted transactions nearly 40%

* Telecom giant **Verizon** **faced long customer service calls** that weakened agents’ ability to cross-sell or upsell products during support interactions.

* The issue stemmed from **manual knowledge searches across many internal documents**, slowing responses and reducing time for customer recommendations.

* Verizon deployed an **AI assistant built on Google’s Gemini model**, trained on 15,000 internal documents to surface accurate answers.

* The rollout led to a **nearly 40% increase in agreements across its 28,000-person **service team and faster resolution times for customers.
