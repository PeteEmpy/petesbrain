Hi Peter,

Hope you are well. Sending over some *budget pacing insights* for Uno
Lights [641-333-8364] ahead of Black Friday tomorrow!

Yesterday we had many campaigns spending* more than 100%* meaning that as
we near the end of the month, we may *reach our monthly budget cap on Black
Friday*!

If you have flexibility with budgets, I would review budget allocation
across the account as soon as possible to ensure we have sufficient budgets
in high demand campaigns! Good luck 🚀

Best,
Luiza
