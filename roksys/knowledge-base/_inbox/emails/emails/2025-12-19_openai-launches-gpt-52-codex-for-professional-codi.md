## OpenAI launches GPT-5.2-Codex for professional coding

#### 🚨 Our Report

OpenAI has released GPT-5.2-Codex, its most advanced coding model designed for complex software engineering and cybersecurity tasks. The model includes significant improvements for long-term projects, large code refactors, Windows environments, and notably stronger cybersecurity capabilities that **recently assisted in discovering three React vulnerabilities**.

#### 🔓 Key Points

* A security engineer using GPT-5.1-Codex-Max discovered three previously unknown React Server Components vulnerabilities while investigating a separate security issue, demonstrating **real-world defensive security capabilities** in production software.

* GPT-5.2-Codex achieves state-of-the-art execution on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, with improved ability to handle large repositories and **multi-step coding tasks without losing context** over extended sessions.

* OpenAI is launching an invite-only trusted entry program for vetted security professionals, providing **availability to more permissive models** for legitimate cybersecurity research and authorized red-teaming work.

#### 🔐 Relevance

Security teams should assume **AI will surface vulnerabilities faster and plan for model-driven disclosure workflows**. Organizations must prepare for a landscape where AI can discover security issues at scale, requiring enhanced security practices and potentially reshaping how cybersecurity teams operate.
