Warning Policy violation



Immediate action required: Resources associated with your Google Cloud  
Platform/API project petesbrain-emailsync are being restricted



Dear Developer,


We detected and will disable a publicly exposed service account  
authentication credential associated with the following Google Cloud  
Platform account:

mcp-sheets-reader@petesbrain-emailsync.iam.gserviceaccount.com with key ID  
2d07f6fd31b659fe3f41731feaec95ced54256fb

This key was found at the following URL:  
https://github.com/PeteEmpy/petesbrain/blob/3beb81a6f4304655165bf048e0d8a0d42ae8b9cb/infrastructure/rollback-snapshots/20251211_162044/credentials/mcp_google-sheets-mcp-server_credentials.json

For a subset of abuse issues, we send abuse notifications in log format.  
Please log in to your console and review this abuse notification in Cloud  
Logging.

To prevent potential security and abuse risks, this service account  
authentication credential will be disabled in accordance with your  
organisational policy for 'Service account key exposure response'. Your  
service account credential may have been inadvertently published in public  
sources or websites (for instance, the credentials were mistakenly uploaded  
to a service like GitHub). Please note that as the project/account owner,  
you are responsible for securing your resources.

Immediate action is required to secure your account(s). We strongly  
recommend that you take the following steps:


Log in to the Google Cloud Console and review the activity on your account.
Rotate the credential for the disabled service account.
Take immediate steps to ensure that your service account credentials are  
not embedded in public source code systems, stored in download directories  
or unintentionally shared in other ways.

The security of your Google Cloud Platform account(s) is important to us.  
You can find more information on securely using IAM here, and also  
recommend best practices for keeping service account keys safe. Please let  
us know if you have additional questions by contacting Google Cloud Support.




Request an appeal
