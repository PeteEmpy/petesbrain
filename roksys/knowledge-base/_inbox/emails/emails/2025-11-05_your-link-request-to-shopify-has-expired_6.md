Hello,

Your request to allow Shopify to provide point-of-sale and inventory data  
to show local products on Google has expired because we haven't received  
the data from your point-of-sale or inventory data provider.

If you think that this is a mistake, contact your point-of-sale or  
inventory data provider's representative. Afterwards, you can send the  
request again by going to your Merchant Center account, Tree2mydoor  
107469209, and selecting the point-of-sale or inventory data provider again.
If you have questions, we want to help. Contact the Merchant Center Support  
team here.

Yours sincerely,
The Google Merchant Center team
