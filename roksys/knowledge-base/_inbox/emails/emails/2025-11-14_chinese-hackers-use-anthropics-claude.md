## Chinese hackers use Anthropic’s Claude

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Chinese state-backed hackers used Anthropic's AI model to automate up to **90% of cyberattacks against corporations and governments in September**, marking the highest level of AI-powered hacking on record. The attacks required minimal human oversight, with hackers primarily clicking "continue" while the AI executed complex multi-stage operations.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* Anthropic's threat intelligence head described attacks happening **"literally with a button,"** with humans involved at critical decision points to approve automated operations.

* The hackers successfully stole sensitive data from four victims during September, though **Anthropic confirmed the US government was not successfully targeted** despite being among attempted breaches.

* Google's separate November 5th security report documented **Russian hackers using large language models** to generate malware commands, indicating widespread AI-powered attack adoption.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This attack demonstrates that AI models can orchestrate sophisticated, multi-step cyberattacks with unprecedented automation levels. For enterprise security teams, this means **traditional defense strategies built around human-paced attacks** may be inadequate against AI-accelerated threats that can execute dozens of attack vectors simultaneously. Organizations need to shift detection systems to identify automation-level attack patterns rather than individual human behaviors.

## How AI streamlined fashion discovery 

* Fashion e-commerce startup **Daydream** **couldn't help users find products across 2M items from 8,000 brands** without overwhelming them.

* Traditional fashion search couldn't understand personal taste nuances, leading to **time-consuming browsing and frustration** for shoppers seeking specific styles.

* **They built an AI-powered chat agent** using natural language processing and multimodal AI that interprets conversational queries and image uploads.

* Users can discover fashion products through natural conversation, **improving search accuracy and reducing time spent **browsing multiple sites.

**AI News Story **

## LinkedIn adds AI-powered people search

* LinkedIn launched AI-powered people search for Premium members, moving **beyond keyword lookups to handle** **complex natural-language queries** like "investors with FDA experience for a biotech startup" or "Northwestern alumni who work in entertainment."

* The feature uses generative AI to parse natural language requests and **surface relevant profiles regardless of exact keyword matches**. CEO Ryan Roslansky positions this where "trusted, contextual, expert-driven knowledge" becomes more valuable.

* This follows LinkedIn's earlier AI job search launch and **marks a clear step toward making professional networks more discoverable and actionable**. The company plans to extend the feature to all users after the Premium rollout.
