* **Biz4Group**, a software company specializing in AI solutions, built a social media app that let users create and share AI-generated visuals.

* The startup faced **high token expenses** from repeated AI requests for similar content, threatening its budget and long-term scalability.

* Biz4Group introduced a **caching system** that stored generated media, reusing it instead of triggering AI calls for identical prompts.

* This approach **reduced token usage and boosted engagement**, with user-generated content up 50% and session time increasing by 40%.

## Skana Robotics uses AI for underwater communication

* Skana Robotics has developed SeaSphere, **a fleet management system that enables underwater autonomous vessels to communicate** across long distances without surfacing. 

* SeaSphere highlights a critical defense challenge where submarines and underwater robots traditionally had to surface to transmit data, exposing them to detection. **The company's approach uses older, more predictable AI algorithms** rather than modern large language models to ensure reliability in military applications.

* Founded in 2024, the startup is currently in talks for a major government contract and plans to **release the commercial version in 2026** as maritime security concerns grow due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
