Let the lawsuits begin. President Trump signed his [promised executive order](https://www.thedeepview.com/newsletter/trump-to-challenge-state-ai-laws) seeking to limit states’ ability to regulate AI. 

While the president likely lacks the legal ability to preempt state lawmaking, the order will establish an AI Litigation Task Force, restrict federal funding and grants for states that pass “onerous AI laws,” and attempt to preempt state lawmaking through powers granted to the Federal Trade Commission. Already, state leaders are [threatening](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/12/trump-states-defiant-ai-executive-order) legal action should the Trump administration enforce the order.

Senator Ted Cruz took up the cause of limiting states’ intervention in AI over the summer, but the moratorium was [kiboshed](https://statescoop.com/state-ai-moratorium-dies-senate/). Now, Trump is taking the executive order route after lobbying from the tech industry and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, who claimed that a patchwork of state AI regulations would handicap the US in the global race for AI dominance. 

State-by-state regulation can be onerous for businesses. In the auto industry, for instance, carmakers have historically had to grapple with emissions standards that vary from one state to another within the US. But critics of the action say that Team Trump’s crackdown on state AI legislation fails to address safety concerns for Americans and children in particular.

“With this Executive Order, Trump is delivering exactly what his billionaire benefactors demanded — all at the expense of our kids, our communities, our workers, and our planet,” Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey said. “A broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress has rejected the AI moratorium again and again, and I intend to keep that streak going.”

While there have been over 1,000 AI regulation bills [proposed](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-a-bold-plan-to-ban-state-ai-laws-fell-apartand-divided-trumpworld-96bce19d?mod=article_inline) at the state level, per the WSJ, it’s still hard to tell what exactly the effects of strict state-level AI regulation might be. Nevertheless, it looks like lobbying against state regulation may already be paying off. New York Governor Kathy Hochul plans to strike the text of the recently passed RAISE Act and replace it with SB 53, a more lenient AI law passed in California, Transformer [reported](https://www.transformernews.ai/p/new-york-governor-hochul-raise-act-sb-53).

For those favoring a “one rulebook approach” to AI regulation, this probably won’t move the needle. Executive orders lack the teeth of congressional law. Plus, as Semafor’s Ben Smith [pointed](https://x.com/tbpn/status/1998893987986583669?s=20) out on TBPN, Trump’s recent embrace of the AI industry with little public messaging could embolden anti-AI Republicans in the midterms.

# 20× Faster Inference, Built to Scale

Advanced reasoning, agentic, long‑context, and multimodal workloads are driving a surge in inference demand—with more tokens per task and tighter latency budgets—yet GPU‑based inference is memory‑bandwidth bound, streaming weights from off‑chip HBM for each token and producing multi‑second to minutes-long delays that erode user engagement.

[Cerebras Inference](https://chat.cerebras.ai/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=speedsummer&utm_content=deepview) shatters this bottleneck through its revolutionary wafer-sized chip architecture, which uses exponentially faster memory that is closer to compute, delivering frontier‑model outputs at interactive speed.

## Nvidia + HPE’s _AI alternative_ to AWS and Microsoft

Nvidia and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) are sharpening their pitch that AI factories are the next big unlock for enterprise AI.

At the AI Summit in New York City, representatives from both companies argued that businesses need to evolve beyond traditional data centers, which were built around training large language models, and toward AI factories that are engineered for the power-hungry inference workloads behind applications. With the right architecture, they said, organizations can inject advanced AI into everyday workflows across HR, legal, R&D, and operations with fewer bottlenecks than they face in legacy compute environments.

“Traditional compute architectures aren't working,” Matthew Hitt, OEM Sales Manager at Nvidia, said during the December 11 panel. He pointed to network chokepoints and power and cooling limits that are slowing down adoption. “The AI factory has a new thought process behind it, of ‘power in, tokens out.’”

Their pitch comes as Nvidia and HPE embark on a charm offensive to expand their joint ecosystem to build out AI factories. In December, they opened their first [AI factory lab](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/press-release/2025/12/hpe-and-nvidia-simplify-ai-ready-data-centers-with-secure-next-gen-ai-factories.html) in Grenoble, France to serve European customers who want local control over their infrastructure and data rather than relying on large US cloud providers. The move marks one of the first major buildouts since the companies established their AI focused partnership in June 2024.

Onstage, Hitt and Christopher Smith, a sales leader rep for HPE’s cloud, services, and AI division, highlighted GPUs that sit at the core of these deployments. That includes the RTX Pro Server for inference workloads, HGX B300 for training, and its GB200 NVL72 rack of GPUs. They positioned these as building blocks for both private-cloud AI environments and larger factory-scale builds.

The vision still comes with constraints. AI factories draw significant energy and water and require specialized engineering that can slow the path from pilot to production. The speakers pointed to HPE’s custom architecture work, sustainability dashboards, and liquid cooling as attempts to smooth those barriers.

With the concept still early, Hitt said enterprises will need partners to make these systems real. “You're not going to be successful on your own,” he said. “This is too complex.”

Caption: 

AI factories also dovetail with the growing sovereign cloud movement, as governments and enterprises in Canada and the EU push to keep sensitive data and compute within national and regional borders. By packaging high-performance AI infrastructure into localized, privately operated environments, Nvidia and HPE are offering a potential alternative for some workloads to US giants like AWS and Microsoft that dominate the global cloud market.

# Leaders tell how to _future-proof jobs_ from AI

The AI boom will not wipe out all jobs.

At the AI Summit in New York City, leaders across HR, edtech, and social media shared frank views on which roles will endure and what skills workers need to stay competitive as automation spreads.

Since January of 2025, tech companies have eliminated nearly 50,000 U.S. jobs, and named AI as a key driver, according to a November study from HR consulting firm [Challenger, Gray & Christmas](https://www.challengergray.com/blog/october-challenger-report-153074-job-cuts-on-cost-cutting-ai/). Mariano Allegra, SVP of commercial strategy at tech recruitment firm Lawrence Harvey, said that while AI may be “eating away” at the job market, he’s seeing a hiring surge in defense and robotics.

Allegra said those clients are “kicking up” compensation to pull talent from other industries. Professionals who understand AI are especially sought after, including “AI trainers” who can embed the technology into corporate workflows to boost productivity.

Some workers are already using AI to expand their opportunities. Yesim Saydan, an independent AI and communication strategist, said she was able to take on more clients after she began creating custom chatbots. Working with entrepreneurs to build their LinkedIn brands, Saydan fine-tunes each GPT to match their voice and business goals so it can draft content in their preferred style, freeing up time for strategy.

Saydan said the rise of agentic AI will make the ability to manage these “AI employees” a core workplace skill. “People with AI skills who know how to manage agents and make different agents work together is a skill that will be needed,” she told The Deep View.

During the panel, Daniele Grassi, president and CEO of General Assembly, an upskilling platform, argued that the greatest risk comes when companies fail to reskill the talent they already have. He pointed to a financial services client that kept its talent by retraining employees whose roles were cut and placing them in UX design and product management.

“Lifelong learning,” Grassi said, is the only reliable way for workers to stay competitive as AI reshapes the future of work.

Caption: 

Behind the optimism around reskilling, AI-driven job replacement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for companies looking to do more with fewer workers. A [2025 survey](https://www.airesumebuilder.com/3-in-10-companies-plan-to-replace-employees-with-ai-in-2026/) from AiResumeBuilder.com found that roughly 3 in 10 firms expect to replace workers with AI in 2026, with more than half seeking to automate at least 10% of their roles across teams such as IT and accounting. For employees whose jobs are at risk of automation, knowing how to leverage AI to boost productivity may be necessary to keep their jobs.
