Hello,

On 17 November 2025, 17:59:42 GMT you uploaded a feed named Black Friday  
2025  in your Google Merchant Center account (Account ID: 102535465) that  
contained significantly fewer items than the previous upload.

The drop in uploaded items in this feed was significant enough to activate  
a product protection removal delay feature that is enabled for your account  
via your account settings.

As a result, we've created new items and updated existing items based on  
the information from this feed. However, to prevent accidental deletion of  
a significant number of your items, we haven't removed the items missing in  
the feed from your account. If no action is taken, these missing items will  
remain active until their previous expiry date, up to 30 days.

If you did not intend to delete the missing items, please check the most  
recently uploaded feed for any errors and upload it again.

If you did intend to remove those items,&nbsp;please refer to the warning  
within the feed processing page for Black Friday 2025  where you can choose  
to proceed with deletion of those offers.

Yours sincerely,

The Google Merchant Center team
