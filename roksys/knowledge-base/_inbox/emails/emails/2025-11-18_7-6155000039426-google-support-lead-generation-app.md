Hi Team,


During our discussion today, we reviewed the issue with offline conversion
data not being accepted recently in the ads account. Additionally, we
noticed that the total conversions are not matching, with approximately 600
conversions not being accepted.

As we discussed, please ensure that only conversions from Google Ads paid
sources are included, and any data from other sources is excluded. Once
this is done, kindly upload the data using the "Manual Run" option under
the conversion action.

Please let us know if you encounter any issues or have any further
questions.

Sincerely,

Lokesh B
Technical Solutions Team
Google Operations Center
