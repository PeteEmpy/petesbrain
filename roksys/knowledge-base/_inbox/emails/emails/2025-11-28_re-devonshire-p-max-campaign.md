## Message

Hi Peter,

I hope you're managing okay with the Black Friday rush.

My apologies for the delayed response—I held off until I had a concrete
update to provide you with.

We have completed all possible escalations on our side and must confirm
that *there is no resolution available at this time*. I absolutely
appreciate how frustrating this situation must be.

We still want to discuss how we can accommodate you. Do you have time for a
quick call on *Monday*? My manager will also join to clarify what has
happened here.

Kr
