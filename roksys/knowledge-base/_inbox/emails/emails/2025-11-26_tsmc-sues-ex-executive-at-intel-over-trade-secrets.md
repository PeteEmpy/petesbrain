## TSMC sues ex-executive at Intel over trade secrets

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has **sued** **former senior vice president Lo Wen-jen**, alleging he leaked trade secrets to Intel after leaving the company. The case was filed on November 25 at Taiwan’s Intellectual Property and Commercial Court under a non-compete agreement Lo signed during his tenure.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* TSMC says Lo **violated** a **non-compete agreement** he signed during his employment, with the company asserting there's a "high likelihood" he shared confidential information with his current employer.

* **The lawsuit was filed Nov. 25, 2025** and targets a senior-level executive who had connections to TSMC's most sensitive manufacturing processes and advanced chip technologies before departing for Intel.

* The case reflects **intense competition for talent** among leading chipmakers, as companies battle to protect proprietary manufacturing knowledge while recruiting scarce technical expertise.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This case **highlights the growing battles over talent mobility** in the semiconductor industry, where executive knowledge of cutting-edge manufacturing processes can provide massive competitive advantages. For chip companies, **protecting trade secrets while competing for scarce technical expertise** has become a critical business challenge that requires robust non-compete agreements and careful vetting of departing executives.
