## 🖼️ OpenAI launches ChatGPT Images

#### 🚨 Our Report

OpenAI has released **ChatGPT Images powered by GPT‑Image‑1.5**, its latest text‑to‑image model that delivers faster, more precise, and more consistent image generation. The update **adds a dedicated image creation space inside ChatGPT.** Users can edit, transform, and render visuals up to four times faster while preserving likeness and detail.

#### 🔓 Key Points

* **GPT‑Image‑1.5 improves instruction following and text rendering**, enabling fine‑grained edits without losing lighting, composition, or facial consistency across multiple revisions.

* The **Images experience** introduces preset filters, trending prompts, and a likeness upload feature so users can **reuse their appearance across future creations** without re‑uploading photos.

* In the API, GPT‑Image‑1.5 **has 20% cheaper image inputs and outputs** than its predecessor, making it more cost‑efficient for creative, e‑commerce, and creative teams generating large visual catalogs.

#### 🔐 Relevance

This release** positions ChatGPT as a full creative workspace**, not just a text interface. Faster generation and consistent** visual fidelity give design, creative, and product teams** a practical way to prototype and produce media at scale. It also raises expectations for enterprise‑grade AI image tools where cost control and brand consistency matter most.

## Meta adds hearing boost to smart glasses

* Meta announced that its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley smart glasses will **hear conversations better in noisy environments**. The conversation-focus feature amplifies the voice of whoever you're talking to,

* Users adjust amplification by swiping the right temple or via settings. The capability targets busy restaurants, bars, commuter trains, and other **crowded spaces where background noise interferes** with conversation.

* Meta also adds Spotify integration to play music matched to what you see. Looking at an album cover triggers songs by that artist. **Viewing holiday decorations prompts seasonal playlists**.
