 Hi  

## AI experiments pop up everywhere—but without a shared baseline and guardrails, adoption stalls. Our **Company-Wide AI Enablement Program** turns scattered pilots into an organization-wide capability, led by HR with Legal and IT embedded from day one.

**Program outcomes**

* **A common language** on capabilities, limits, and risks

* **Function-specific cohorts **(Ops, CS, Finance, Sales) with relevant use cases

* **Practical prompting frameworks** and productivity plays that managers can use immediately

* **Clear guardrails** aligned to your policies (privacy, accuracy, security)

**How it runs**

* **Multi-session program**, virtual or hybrid (on-site days optional)

* **Discovery → bespoke curriculum** & comms kit → cohort delivery → reinforcement sessions

* **Investment & timeline**: scoped to your size and functions (proposal provided after a 30-minute call)

**Why us?**
We deliver this model for enterprise teams and leadership groups; **our team has also built SHRM’s AI credential, ensuring that curriculum quality and rollout discipline are built in.**
