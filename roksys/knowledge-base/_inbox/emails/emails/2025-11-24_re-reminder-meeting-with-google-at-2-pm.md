Hey Peter,

Thanks for letting us know.

We reviewed the accounts and wanted to share some insights and action
points for this week.

For *Accessories for the Home* (797-299-4730), clicks in the category are
up WoW:

However, when looking into the accounts clicks (green) vs the category, as
well as the accounts investment vs the category (yellow), we can see there
is demand that we are not currently capturing.

When looking into the account’s budget pacing over the last 7 days, we can
see there is a real mix of campaigns either under or over spending their
daily budgets. I’d recommend ensuring all campaigns have enough coverage to
capture any incremental conversions this week & next, especially the ones
that have consistently been over-spending, as we run the risk of them
intentionally under-serving to stay within their monthly budget allocation.

Regarding *Uno Lights* (641-333-8364 <(641)%20333-8364>) the category
clicks are also trending up:

While demand is increasing, your main campaign (Heroes & Sidekicks) is
currently limited by target, meaning we could receive more conversion value
with a smaller relative decrease in targets.

By giving the campaign a more flexible ROAS, we’ll allow it to enter more
auctions and capture those sales it's currently missing. The ROAS
percentage might settle a little lower, but the total sales volume and
revenue should increase. Here's what we missed out on since the beginning
of the month:

Please check the *recommendations tab* with some suggestions:

The Villains campaign is spending more than their daily budget and as a
result will intentionally under-serve to stay within the monthly budgetary
allocation. Below is a budget pacing report showing how much % your
campaigns overspent on budget yesterday:

During BFCM, every major competitor will be raising their bids. To avoid
dropping down the search results pages, we must ensure our bids (tROAS) and
budgets are competitive enough starting today.

*Please let us know your thoughts.*

Thanks,
