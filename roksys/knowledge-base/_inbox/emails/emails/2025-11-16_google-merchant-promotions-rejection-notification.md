Hi Merchant Promotions customer,

We would like to notify you that some of the promotions for Smythson of  
Bond Street (Merchant Center account ID 102535465) have been rejected.

Note: If you are using a third-party platform such as Shopify or  
WooCommerce to connect your promotions with Google, please update and fix  
the promotions directly on the third-party platform that you're using.

Promotion # 1: BF2025_BOOKS_20

Long title: Black Friday 20% off Books


Reason for rejection: Unmapped

This promotion did not pass the validation test because the promotion ID  
has either not been mapped to any items in your product feed, products are  
disapproved, your product feed is not fully processed or your promotion is  
set for a locale to which there are no corresponding product feeds. As a  
result, your promotion was not valid for any products. When a promotion is  
for SPECIFIC_PRODUCTS, the promotion ID must be mapped to eligible items in  
the product feed.

To resolve this issue and complete the review process so that your  
promotion can be displayed, map the promotion ID(s) listed by following  
these steps:
1. Add the 'promotion_id' attribute to your product feed as a new column.

2. Add the promotion's 'promotion_id' to each product that the promotion  
applies to in your product feed. You can map up to 10 promotions to an  
item. Please note that promotion IDs are case and space sensitive.
3. Re-upload your product feed to Merchant Center.
4. Request a re-review for your promotion in the Promotions dashboard
Once these changes have been made, the promotion will undergo a validation  
review again within 24 hours.
