**Welcome back.** Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a problem with AI. On Tuesday, the actor [announced on X](https://x.com/hitrecordjoe/status/2001043548603621829?s=46) the founding of an organization called the [Creators Coalition on AI](https://www.creatorscoalitionai.com/), with the goal of protecting artists from the “unethical business practices a lot of the big AI companies are guilty of.” The coalition notes on its landing page that its existence is “not a full rejection of AI,” but rather has the goal of leveraging the collective power of creatives to lobby for “human-centered innovation.” The coalition isn’t Gordon-Levitt’s first finger-wagging against AI, having signed the [Statement on Superintelligence](https://superintelligence-statement.org/) in recent months — calling for a temporary prohibition of next-gen AI until there's more societal buy-in — alongside fellow stars like Kate Bush, [Will.I.am](https://Will.I.am), and Natasha Lyonne. _—Nat Rubio-Licht_

# Demis vs. LeCun: Who do we believe on AGI?

The AI industry has no idea what artificial general intelligence actually is.

The concept of a generalized AI model capable of understanding everything a human can — across all domains of knowledge — has been a guiding principle for next-gen AI. But defining what AGI looks like continues to befuddle the industry. 

Demis Hassabis, CEO and founder of Google DeepMind, said that his firm might be closing in on it. 

* In a podcast published on Tuesday, the tech leader told [Cambridge University math professor Hannah Fry on a podcast ](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2000985655715807599?t=2071)that Nano Banana Pro, the company’s latest image model, is “getting towards a sort of AGI for imaging,” or a “general-purpose system that can do anything across images.”

* He pointed to the firm’s success with language models and its Genie world model. But the key to generalized intelligence may lie in “converging” these technologies. 

* “They're intertwined, but we need to converge them all into one big model,” said Hassabis. “That might start becoming a candidate for proto-AGI.”

Meanwhile, Yann LeCun, former Chief AI Scientist at Meta, begs to differ. [On The Information Bottleneck podcast on Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u-DXVADyhc&t=1743s), LeCun reiterated his long-held idea that large language models are not the magic key to superintelligence that pushes beyond the boundaries of human comprehension.

 "The path to superintelligence - just train up the LLMs, train on more synthetic data, hire thousands of people to school your system in post-training, invent new tweaks on [Reinforcement Learning], I think is complete bullshit,” he said. “It's just never going to work.” 

In fact, LeCun shot down the idea that AGI is possible at all, claiming that there is “no such thing” because humans don’t even have generalized intelligence. Thinking of ourselves as generalized is an extreme over-estimation of our skills, LeCun argues. 

“This concept makes no sense, because it’s really designed to designate human-level intelligence, but human intelligence is super specialized,” LeCun said.

We don’t expect Ariana Grande to be an astrophysicist. We don’t expect Neil DeGrasse Tyson to play Glinda in the movie “Wicked.” And we don’t expect you, dear reader, to be able to do either of those things while also handling the ins and outs of your day-to-day life. So why do we _really _need a system capable of that and more? And is it really possible to create that? As LeCun said, humans are specialized – and for good reason. A jack of all trades is a master of none.

# OpenAI + AWS: Circular financing lives!

OpenAI is in talks for a $10 billion investment from Amazon, The Information [reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-talks-raise-least-10-billion-amazon-use-ai-chips?offer=email-monthly-digest-749-2025%2Cemail-monthly-digest-299-2025%2Cemail-monthly-digest-yp-225-2025&utm_campaign=Leads%3A+Amazon+and+Op&utm_content=11525&utm_medium=email&utm_source=cio&utm_term=7846). The deal would value OpenAI above $500 billion and could lead the company to use Amazon’s Trainium chips to train its models. 

Reporting on the deal once again raised fears about circular deals in the AI world, which could cause dramatic financial damage if AI demand dries up. Still, OpenAI using Trainium chips would be a coup for Amazon, which has been attempting to challenge Nvidia’s AI chipmaking supremacy.

The AI industry has been the subject of some scrutiny over deals that essentially involve one firm investing in another firm that agrees to buy products from the first firm. 

* For instance, Nvidia [invested](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/nvidia-s-massive-openai-deal-fuels-circular-financing-concerns) $100 million in OpenAI to support a data center buildout that would involve OpenAI buying Nvidia chips. 

* Such deals can accelerate AI labs' ability to secure financing to train models, but critics [argue](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/2025/12/nvidia-ai-financing-deals/685197/) that the interconnectedness of AI companies could lead to a severe crash.

In this case, OpenAI has already [made](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/technology/openai-amazon-cloud-computing.html) a $38 billion commitment to purchase cloud computing services from Amazon, so Amazon is on the list of debt obligations that OpenAI will be using its fresh $10 billion to meet. The connection between the two companies raised eyebrows from industry watchers.

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/nearcyan/status/2001124514244263986?s=20)

Others dismissed concerns about the deal. 

“This is just good business for Amazon and others. Invest at a lower valuation and ultimately take profits at a higher one while putting money into companies that will consume from your technology and grow the utilization of said technology over time,” The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman [said](https://x.com/danielnewmanUV/status/2001366643436315110?s=20).

Circular AI deals are concerning, but a lot of the risk surrounding them is arguably being priced in. CoreWeave, a poster child for the incestuous AI economy, has gotten [drubbed](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/coreweave-stock-market-ai-bubble-a3c8c321?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdeXShRFjlMSM8cvl9lfQqJqssbihK_PGPW1-U6gHmZY1zKnGRLNFHGwvd7QO0%3D&gaa_ts=69430736&gaa_sig=yOaQbBXJuShdxTWNZSM-G3CcBveXrYs-uzhNqqzWDuZI6tquSa15s3WWMz8peRQd16jue0ujW5tTDqrzWvIsVQ%3D%3D) by investors over the past few months. What may be more consequential here is OpenAI signaling its increasing willingness to use chips other than Nvidia’s. That’s probably why Amazon’s stock got a bump at market open after the OpenAI deal news broke, while Nvidia dropped.

# VC a16z leaps into the fray on AI legislation

Venture capital behemoth Andreessen Horowitz — also known as [a16z](https://a16z.com/) —unveiled a list of nine pillars it hopes to see enacted in US federal AI legislation. 

The list was published shortly after [President Trump issued an executive order](https://www.thedeepview.com/newsletter/trump-s-eo-nationalizing-ai-lacks-teeth) limiting states’ ability to regulate AI, and as former a16z general partner Sriram Krishnan and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks go on a roadshow, [warming](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/14/trump-ai-executive-order-divisions/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzY1Njg4NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY3MDcwNzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NjU2ODg0MDAsImp0aSI6IjkyZWE2NjZhLTYwMzYtNDEzYi04MzJmLThjMTgzNDQwYjRlMCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI1LzEyLzE0L3RydW1wLWFpLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1vcmRlci1kaXZpc2lvbnMvIn0.8KXdv8ty_YpWDRgeb6fkZubMbijwTV-h3Dc0J_xokdY) state GOP leaders to the idea of federal leadership in AI legislation. Andreessen’s position takes a middle ground on the issue, arguing that Congress should “lead” on AI legislation while states also play an important role.

[A16z’s nine pillars](https://a16z.com/a-roadmap-for-federal-ai-legislation-protect-people-empower-builders-win-the-future/) can be roughly split into three categories:

* Reining in AI companies: Punish harmful uses of AI, protect children from AI-related harms, protect against catastrophic cyber and national security risks, establish a national standard for model transparency

* Ensuring federal leadership in AI lawmaking: Ensure federal leadership in AI development, while protecting states’ ability to police harmful use of AI 

* Investing in and adopting AI: Invest in AI talent by supporting workers and educating students, invest in infrastructure: compute, data, and energy; invest in AI research, use AI to modernize government service delivery 

One argument a16z returns to throughout the paper is that federal legislative frameworks should focus on protecting competition to bolster "Little Tech," Marc Andreessen’s [favorite](https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/) term for startups. 

While a16z’s legislative pillars may prove influential given the venture capital firm’s political clout, any actual legislation may still be a ways away. There is currently no federal AI framework bill working its way through Congress.

Democrats have been [swift](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/media/press-releases/ocasio-cortez-calls-out-pattern-corruption-behind-trump-and-republican-efforts) to criticize the Trump Administration for what they see as an attempt to greatly limit oversight of the AI industry. For Andreessen Horowitz, which is [reportedly](https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/andreessen-horowitz-hires-facebook-policy-official-ai-vision/) very active in lobbying Trump on AI, this paper may be an attempt to show that a16z wants to put reasonable limits on AI companies’ power. Still, time matters for Trump and a16z. A “blue wave” in the midterms could make it much more difficult to pass light-touch federal AI legislation.
