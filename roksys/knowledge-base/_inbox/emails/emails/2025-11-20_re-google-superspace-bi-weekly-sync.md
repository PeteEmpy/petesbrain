Thanks Peter. That is phenomenal success! Sinead and I just met and we were
thinking it would be great to keep the call, we've got some ideas that
might help during the rest of the season. Even if it's a quick 15 mins!
Is this just on hero stock, or everything? I appreciate you can’t sell what
you don’t have, but can focus on creating the future. Here are some
recommendations based on the current data. If possible, could we move our
call and meet at 4.30pm?

*Continue momentum and set up January for SUCCESS **🎄🎁🚀*
1. The "Gift of Play" Pivot (Gift Cards)
The Problem: We are losing out on immediate conversion revenue as stock
depletes.
The Solution: Shift the creative narrative to Gift Cards.

   - *Narrative:* "Give them the gift of choice" or "Secure their dream
   setup for the New Year."
   - *Execution:* Swap out product-specific "Buy Now" ads for "Give the
   Gift of Everplay" creatives immediately upon stockout.

2. Capture Demand: The "Back-in-Stock" Engine
The Data: We are seeing an average conversion lag of 5.6 days from first
interaction.
The Implication: People take time to decide. If they hit a "Sold Out" page
now and leave, we lose that 5.6-day consideration window.
The Fix:

   - *Incentivized Sign-ups:* Instead of a dead-end "Out of Stock" button,
   you could consider a prominent *"Notify Me & Get [X]% Off"* CTA.
   - *Why:* This keeps the user in the funnel. We capture their data now,
   reducing the friction when stock lands in the new year.

3. Upper Funnel: Launch YouTube & CTV in December
I know you are running out of stock, but you could take advantage of this
time by building awareness for 2026.

   - *Connected TV (CTV) & YouTube:* These channels are massive right now
   for visual storytelling. We can show the product in action (kids playing,
   building forts) to build desire *before* the buy button is available.
   - *Strategy:* Run a "Worth the Wait" or Brand Awareness campaign on
   YouTube/CTV aimed purely at *Email Sign-ups*.
   - *Goal:* Build a massive waitlist so that when inventory arrives, we
   have warm leads ready to convert instantly on Day 1.

4. Forecasting & Production
Collecting this intent data (Gift Card sales + Waitlist sign-ups) is
critical for your operations. It will give you a hard number on immediate
demand, allowing you to accurately forecast the units needed for the Q1
manufacturing run.
