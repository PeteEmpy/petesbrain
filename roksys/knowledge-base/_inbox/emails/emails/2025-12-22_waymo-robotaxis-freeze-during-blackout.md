## Waymo robotaxis freeze during blackout

#### 🚨** Our Report**

Alphabet-owned Waymo temporarily **suspended its driverless taxi service** in San Francisco on Saturday after a citywide power outage left several vehicles stalled and blocking intersections. The company restored operations Sunday once power returned to affected areas.

#### **🔓 Key Points**

* Videos on social media showed **multiple Waymo robotaxis frozen in traffic**, forcing human drivers to navigate around them as inactive stoplights worsened congestion.

* The outage impacted roughly **130,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers**, halting traffic signals and transit systems across the city, according to Waymo’s spokesperson.

* Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted that **“Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected”**, highlighting the companies’ differing navigation systems: Tesla relies on cameras and AI, while Waymo depends on detailed pre-mapped data.

#### 🔐** Relevance**

The incident exposes a key vulnerability in **map-dependent autonomous systems during infrastructure failures**. For regulators and operators, it reinforces the need for resilient fallback protocols and real-time adaptability in self-driving fleets as cities weigh large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI helped a startup launch for under $5K

* Entrepreneur Caleb Musser built BoxMow, **a rideshare-style waste disposal platform**, serving Charlotte and Charleston with next-day pickup services. 

* Traditional waste disposal **required technical expertise and significant capital investment**. This created barriers for non-technical founders entering the market. 

* Musser used **no-code and low-code AI tools** to build the website, including photo analysis for automated quoting, for less than $5,000. 

* The result so far: roughly **50 pickups completed with around 20 drivers **across two markets, proving AI democratizes startup creation.

## OpenAI lets users set ChatGPT tone

* OpenAI has introduced a **Personalization menu that lets users adjust ChatGPT’s warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use**, offering “More,” “Less,” or “Default” settings for each.

* The update expands on November’s tone presets (Professional, Candid, Quirky) and followed user feedback that earlier versions felt either too flattering or too cold. **It marks OpenAI’s latest step toward giving users finer control over chatbot personality and communication style.**

* Critics argue that tone manipulation could reinforce addictive behavior or bias user perception. Supporters see it as **a move toward safer, more transparent AI-human interaction** that adapts to individual preferences.

## Google delays Assistant-to-Gemini transition

* Google pushed back its plan to replace Assistant with Gemini on Android devices, extending the timeline into 2026. The company cited the need for **"a seamless transition"** after originally targeting completion by end of 2025.

* The delay affects Android devices. **Gemini has already launched** on Wear OS watches, Android Auto, and Nest devices. Mobile integration presents more complex engineering challenges.

* Google added core assistant functions to Gemini this year, including calls, timers, and messaging, while letting users opt out of AI training. The transition represents **the end of Google Assistant** as Android's primary voice interface.
