## Summary

- Stability AI largely won its UK copyright lawsuit against Getty Images, with the court ruling that Stable Diffusion did not infringe Getty's copyright, though it narrowly lost on trademark infringement
- Google unveiled Project Suncatcher, an initiative to deploy AI compute infrastructure in space using solar-powered satellites with TPUs in low-earth orbit, with first prototypes launching in 2027
- AI energy demand is driving innovation in alternative power solutions, with data center electricity consumption expected to double by 2030 at 15% annual growth rate
- Amazon sent legal threats to Perplexity over its agentic shopping assistant, escalating tensions between traditional tech companies and AI startups

## Key Insights

- The Stability AI vs Getty ruling sets important legal precedent for AI training on copyrighted material, suggesting fair use arguments may prevail in copyright cases while trademark protections remain stronger
- Tech giants are pursuing radical infrastructure solutions (space-based computing, cryogenic power) to address AI's massive energy requirements, indicating current terrestrial infrastructure may be insufficient for AI scaling ambitions
- The 4x faster growth rate of AI data center energy demand compared to other sectors signals a potential infrastructure crisis that could constrain AI development without breakthrough solutions
- Legal conflicts between established tech companies and AI startups (Amazon vs Perplexity) reveal growing competitive tensions as AI capabilities threaten existing business models

**Welcome back. **Perplexity and Amazon are putting up their dukes. The e-commerce giant has [sent legal threats](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/amazon-sends-legal-threats-to-perplexity-over-agentic-browsing/) to the AI startup, warning the company that its agentic shopping assistant violated Amazon’s terms of service by failing to identify itself as an AI agent. Perplexity responded by publishing a blog post titled [“bullying is not innovation,”](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/bullying-is-not-innovation) calling out Amazon for leveraging “intimidation to block innovation and make life worse for people.”

# Google targets space-based AI infrastructure

Google is looking towards the cosmos to meet AI’s energy demand. 

On Tuesday, the tech giant unveiled [Project Suncatcher](https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/), an initiative to scale AI compute in space. The goal is to harness the power of the Sun via satellites in orbit and minimize the impact of AI infrastructure on “terrestrial resources,” the company said. 

The initiative will equip “solar-powered satellite constellations” with Google’s Tensor Processing Units and inter-satellite links, keeping them in constant view of the sun in low-earth orbit to run on solar power perpetually. The first two prototype satellites for the project will be launched in 2027. 

Google noted in its research paper that a solar panel can be eight times more productive in orbit than it is on Earth if placed in the proper orbit. “In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute,” Travis Beals, senior director of Project Suncatcher, wrote in the report.  

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1985754323813605423)

Google’s initiative isn’t the first time we’ve seen companies seek creative solutions to AI’s energy and resource problems. 

* Microsoft, for example, has [filed a number of patent applications](https://www.thedailyupside.com/cio/cloud-computing/microsoft-may-see-cryogens-as-key-to-data-centers-energy-problem/) for inventions in recent years for systems that rely on cryogenic power, or cold energy, to power data centers.

* Nvidia, meanwhile, has partnered with Starcloud, a company that aims to [deploy data centers in space](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/starcloud/), which on Monday launched its first satellite equipped with an [Nvidia GPU](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/starcloud-1-satellite-reaches-space-with-nvidia-h100-gpu-now-operating-in-orbit/). 

Given the increasing competition among tech giants to accelerate AI development, the pressure is on to figure out how to fuel that growth.

“Moving some processing off-planet might ease the load on Earth’s power systems, but it also highlights a larger issue: as AI scales, careful planning for sustainable energy use becomes essential across the whole AI infrastructure,” Roman Eloshvili, founder of AI compliance firm ComplyControl, told The Deep View.

Caption: 

It’s no secret that AI is an energy hog. Global energy demand from data centers – driven largely by AI – is expected to double by 2030, according to the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai), with a growth rate of around 15% per year, or four times faster than the growth of total electricity demand from all other sectors. Still, tech companies continue to throw astronomical amounts of cash at massive AI infrastructure buildouts. Given the sheer energy demand of these facilities, whether energy infrastructure – clean or otherwise – can keep up remains unclear.

# Stability wins Getty copyright lawsuit

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/aa164e18-7b02-4391-8726-b6cd33243cdb/ART2__0-00-00-00___51_.jpg?t=1762337130)

AI firms have notched another copyright win. 

Stability AI largely won in its [intellectual property legal battle against Getty Images](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/stability-ai-largely-wins-uk-court-battle-getty-127164244), Britain's High Court ruled on Tuesday. Though a judge ruled that Getty narrowly prevailed in its argument that Stability infringed its trademark, it lost the secondary claim that the AI firm infringed its copyright.

Getty had initially claimed that the AI firm’s Stable Diffusion image generation tool was a “brazen infringement” of its library. Though Getty said the ruling was a “significant win” for IP owners, Stability’s General Counsel Christian Dowell told ABC News that the decision resolves the “core issue” of copyright. 

The ruling comes amid growing tensions between AI firms and copyright holders. The launch of OpenAI’s Sora in late September has already [incensed many Hollywood hotshots](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/ai-video-tools-stoke-hollywood-ire), with major agencies opting to keep their clients off the platform and [SAG-AFTRA decrying](https://x.com/sagaftra/status/1980319140763099374?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ai-has-a-copyright-problem) the growing deepfake problem. 

But the tides may be turning in the favor of model developers, and Stability’s win isn’t the only sign. Last week, Universal Music Group, one of the industry’s most prominent record labels, settled its [copyright lawsuit against AI music platform Udio](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/umg-forges-ai-partnerships), opting instead to partner with the startup. UMG also announced a partnership with Stability to develop “responsibly trained” AI music creation tools.

These partnerships and legal settlements could signal that if creative firms can’t beat the growing movement towards AI in the artistic process, they may simply have to join it.

# AI firms target professional services

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ebad6dc8-7570-4f73-9b86-690a04e18a12/ART3__0-00-00-00___48_.jpg?t=1762337149)

AI companies may see professional services as their cash cow.

Earlier this week, Anthropic announced a partnership with IT [consulting firm Cognizant](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cognizant-adopts-anthropics-claude-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai-adoption-at-scale-and-deploys-claude-to-drive-internal-ai-transformation-302602558.html), deploying the company’s Claude models and agentic tools to up to 350,000 associates across its organization. It’s the third deal of its kind that Anthropic has made in the past month, scoring partnerships with [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-10-07-2025-ibm-and-anthropic-partner-to-advance-enterprise-software-development-with-proven-security-and-governance?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=openai-adds-amazon-to-deals-frenzy) and [Deloitte](https://www.anthropic.com/news/deloitte-anthropic-partnership) in early October.

“Enterprises are moving beyond simple productivity gains toward a more connected, agentic future,” Ravi Kumar S, CEO of Cognizant, said in the announcement. 

And Anthropic isn’t the only firm targeting professional services. [Legal AI startups](https://archive.thedeepview.com/p/legal-ai-frenzy-grows-as-eve-hits-1b) like Harvey, Eve and Filevine have all scored significant funding and sky-high valuations in recent months as investors see massive potential in alleviating the tedium of these industries. 

But actual utility among these industries runs a wide gamut. In the legal field, for example, adoption of generative AI is trending slowly: [According to data from Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/legal-ops-and-tech/legal-ai-revolution-moves-ahead-at-measured-pace-survey-says), only 21% of attorneys report using generative AI “about once a day.” 

A survey of more than 650 lawyers from the [Association of Corporate Counsel](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/in-house-counsel/ai-does-little-to-reduce-law-firm-billable-hours-survey-shows) published in mid-October found that nearly 60% of in-house counsel have seen “no noticeable savings yet” as a result of their AI deployments. 

Consulting, meanwhile, is being fundamentally upended by AI, with some arguing that AI could [entirely replace those jobs](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/uber-cofounder-says-ai-means-some-consultants-are-in-big-trouble/ar-AA1CSTah). Some firms are already trimming headcount as a result of AI, such as Accenture, [which said in September](https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-center/accenture-lays-off-11000-staff-as-part-of-ai-reskilling-strategy/) that it had laid off 11,000 workers who couldn’t be reskilled for AI tasks.  

In an essay [published last week by Enrique Dans](https://medium.com/enrique-dans/the-end-of-billable-hours-how-ai-is-forcing-consulting-to-reinvent-itself-bd3ae059b97b), a professor of innovation at IE University, he noted that consulting forms are “not losing tools, they are losing their monopoly on knowledge.” 

“AI has democratized access to information, models, and methodologies that previously justified hiring an external firm,” Dans wrote.
