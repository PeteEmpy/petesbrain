## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am running an ABO campaign with two ad sets. One ad set has 1 catalog ad, and the other ad set has 6 video and image ads I created. The catalog CAC is much lower than the other ads. Should I just combine everything in one ad set and let meta allocate the spend? Or does everyone keep their catalog ad separate from their creative ads?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Np-Put-543"> /u/Np-Put-543 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p6l4bt/catalog_ad_in_same_ad_set_as_other_creative/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p6l4bt/catalog_ad_in_same_ad_set_as_other_creative/">[comments]</a></span>
