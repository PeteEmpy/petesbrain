## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Holiday advertising strategy and seasonal campaign planning
**Reason**: While the article focuses on holiday advertising which is highly relevant for PPC practitioners planning seasonal Google Ads campaigns, the content preview suggests it's a general playbook covering multiple platforms rather than Google Ads-specific tactics. Without Google Ads-specific optimization strategies or actionable insights visible in the preview, it scores in the medium range.
