## Summary

- Creative fatigue occurs when ad audiences become oversaturated with the same creative assets, leading to declining CTRs, rising CPCs, and reduced campaign performance
- Key warning signals include falling click-through rates, increasing cost-per-click, shrinking reach, and declining engagement metrics over time
- Early detection through consistent monitoring of performance trends allows advertisers to refresh creative before significant performance degradation occurs
- Data-driven creative rotation strategies and systematic testing help extend ad lifespan and maintain campaign efficiency
- While primarily focused on social advertising, these principles apply to Google Ads Display, Discovery, and Performance Max campaigns where visual creative plays a central role

## Key Insights

- Creative fatigue is a predictable lifecycle issue rather than a sudden failure - proactive monitoring of CTR trends, frequency metrics, and CPC increases enables early intervention before major performance drops
- Establishing baseline performance metrics and setting alert thresholds (e.g., 20% CTR decline, frequency above 3-4 for social) creates systematic early-warning systems for creative refresh needs
- Data-driven creative rotation schedules based on historical fatigue patterns for specific audience segments help optimize creative lifespan and prevent waste from prematurely retiring effective assets
- While the article focuses on social platforms, Google Ads practitioners should apply these monitoring principles to Display, Discovery, Demand Gen, and Performance Max campaigns where creative assets significantly impact performance

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Creative fatigue detection and optimization in paid advertising
**Reason**: The article addresses creative fatigue metrics (CTR, CPC) that are relevant to Google Ads Display and Responsive campaigns, but the content and approach appear more geared toward social media advertising where creative fatigue is a more prominent issue. While the concepts apply to some Google Ads formats, this is not core Google Ads strategy content.
