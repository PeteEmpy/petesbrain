## Transcript

We're sitting here on Wednesday >> and overall it was a really great weekend. I was concerned. I'm going to be honest. I I was worried that there was going to be some underperformance relative to the expectations that customers had had [music] mainly due to the first couple of months of November or first couple weeks of November weren't the best. But overall really good weekend [music] to expectation. Some stats. We were plus 7% on total revenue, plus 10% on new customer revenue, always a good sign. Plus 4% on returning revenue, plus [music] 13% on contribution margin, and 0.04% to total spend. So what I'll say is that this is just continues to be a testament. Our teams worked their butts off this weekend in Slack, like grinding [music] every hour, using our hourly tracker, making sure that we are doing the thing that we said we're going to do. And so you see that the [music] spend being within let's say 0.04% on tens of millions of dollars is is amazing. >> All right, quick thing before we jump in. Andromeda. Andromeda. Andromeda.

Welcome to the e-commerce playbook podcast. I'm your host, Richard Gaff, and director of digital product strategy here at Common Threat Collective. And I'm joined today, he's coming to us live with his brand new John Madden Tony Romo headset from the booth, Mr. Taylor Holiday, checking in with us. Taylor, what's going on, man? >> I'm just not built for a static mic, Richard. I'm just not bu I'm not built for it. So, I don't have the body control. >> So, we're we're going full Tony Romo headset to try and improve audio quality. >> That's right. >> We've had we've we've multiple times been down this path. I think this is going to be the solution. I got my wires wired up here into multiple devices, >> but that's not what we're here to talk about. We're here to talk about a Black Friday recap. And we're we're a day late. I and I have to hit on this because we are a day late in getting this data out because our spreadsheet ma the wizard that would be responsible for aggregating this data was not available to us. He was off competing in the Excel world championships live in Las Vegas. So shout out to Elgen man. Held it down. >> Got a incredibly diff difficult puzzle from the genius Harry Gross puzzle creator extraordinaire. battled it out on the global stage live in Las Vegas. And that's just the kind of talent that's running around this joint, Richard. >> Exactly. Right. Right. This our our BFCM data is being put together by a professional and in fact competing at the highest level. Exactly. Yeah. It was a fascinating stream to watch just because I don't know anything about the Excel community at large and the things people were getting roasted about and the things people were cheering for. I got to say I didn't. Just remember if you're you're out there building a spreadsheet today, you are a hobbyist and there is there are professionals. But the spreadsheet that we have here today is actually amazing, too. Like I I I honestly I both both we have a couple of people that are just so good at this. So we have a really cool view into how our Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend went and we're going to dive and slice in that data, overlay it a little bit with some macro data that we've seen come in and jam with you guys about how this weekend went. >> Okay. So let's let's dive right into it then. Starting with Black Friday. >> Well, so I mean I I don't know how you want to break this down. >> Let's go macro. Let's go full overview first. We're sitting here on Wednesday. >> And overall, it was a really great weekend. I was concerned. I'm going to be honest. I I was worried that there was going to be >> some underperformance relative to the expectations that customers had had mainly due to the first couple of months of November weren't the best. But overall, really good weekend to expectation. Some stats. We were plus 7% on total revenue, plus 10% on new customer revenue, always a good sign. Plus 4% on returning revenue, plus 13% on contribution margin, and 004% to total spend. So what I'll say is that this is just continues to be a testament. Our teams worked their butts off this weekend, man, in Slack, like grinding every hour, using our hourly tracker, making sure that we are doing the thing that we said we're going to do. And so you see the the spend being within, let's see, 0.04% 04% on tens of millions of dollars is is amazing and overall delivering positive to the outcome. So we like we like to think of great forecasting on large numbers as sort of plus or minus 10% everywhere. So plus seven on total revenue plus 12 on contribution margin if you're going to miss miss that direction. But overall a really strong weekend when we had some brands do do some really good work. >> Yeah. Okay. So let's talk about then maybe staying with the macro picture some like big stories maybe about what happened kind of over the weekend. So I mean I know there's there are certain instances where somebody would swapped out an offer and that kind of turned things around. Also like one standout metric here is our app loving spend was more than 100% of what of expectation meaning that it delivered in a way that we weren't >> maybe we hoped for but weren't fully expecting. So let's talk about some of those like those stories maybe that came out. >> Yeah, Apple in Q4 will continues to be a big winner where we've seen real scale get produced on a meaningful basis. It's one of the few places where I can see brands going from hundreds of dollars to spend to tens of thousands of dollars to spend really quickly in those moments. And so it gets priority and attention as an ancillary channel because of that scale potential. And we saw a few brands get there. And so really good signs that it's going to continue to be, you know, we're seeing it show up as like number three in share of wallet these days behind Google and Meta. And I think it's going to continue to hold that position. YouTube right there neck and neck and then Tik Tok kind of in the fifth position. But really strong results. We're going to continue to provide brands opportunity. The team over there just grinds too like >> at at they're they're in Slack. They're working with you. They're giving you practical advice on the ad account. They're giving you met or different end card adjustments and opportunities. So, they work hard to try and deliver real value. They're not afraid of a good hold out study. They'll they'll really want to make sure that the spend is incremental. So, good work overall on that side. And I think that sort of contributes to this overarching narrative that new customer revenue was strong. And this weekend tends to, I think, get over discussed as a time to sort of drive value off your existing customer base. And that's certainly true. We see overall revenue was almost exactly 50/50. This is another really interesting in terms of the overall revenue was almost exactly 50/50 new customer and returning customer revenue, but overall stronger new customer performance than anticipated with some brands doing like just a lot a lot better than they thought they could. And that gets us a little bit into the sequence of it all where there was a weird thing that happened and sometimes this happens in meta's pacing where Friday was really strong. It was a good day. Saturday though was the one that was like really an outlier in terms of new customer acquisition performance. >> Like if I sort this by Saturday here, new customer revenue was plus 16%, new orders were plus 20% on that Saturday. Spend on that day was plus 15%. And so we were just able to drive a lot more volume on the Saturday than we anticipated where Cyber Monday ended up being a little bit softer in comparison. >> At Common Thread, we've been fans of Motion from day one. Whenever a client shows up and they're power users of Motion, we instantly know their team actually understands how to run a proper creative flywheel. And if you're not using Motion yet, here's the reality. With Meta's Andromeda update, you can't just lean on a single hero ad anymore. It's all about creative diversity now. how many angles you can test and how quickly you can learn. Andromeda rewards variety, pattern recognition, and real creative insight, which is exactly where most teams fall behind. Most brands don't have the bandwidth to manually tag ads, look for themes, or figure out what Meta is prioritizing. Motion cuts through all of that and reads your ads the way that Meta does. It shows what's working, what's not, and where the actual creative opportunities are. If you want the advantage our best operators use, get Motion in your stack. Mention CTC and they'll build your reports, train your team, and unlock AI tagging. Use code CTC10 for 10% off your first three months. Start your free 14-day trial at motionapp.com. Interesting. Okay, so let's talk about obviously like in terms of our sort of clientele's performance, we were basically spot on in terms of target. It was a good it was a overall a good BFCM weekend. >> Yep. >> Talk about like how does that play into some of like the broader trends across the industry that we saw over this weekend? Yeah, some of the data that I've seen coming in, Adobe puts out a good study. I was listening to my guy Scott Galloway breaking down consumer demand last night and one of the things that's come up is that revenue was roughly plus 7% but orders were actually negative. So >> interesting >> in terms of total volume, what you get is less total purchases at slightly higher prices is functionally the story that you can get there. So, it's a little bit of an inflationary environment where the overall growth might be less than it seems. A couple of other interesting data points that I've seen come out is that buy now pay later usage was up a ton. And in the demographic of like 25 to to 40, it was something like 40% of purchase usages or some like crazy number amongst the younger generation of how much buy now pay later usage there is. And like this is just I think one of the hidden problems of our industrying. I was you ever listen to Caleb Hammer Richard? >> I don't think so. >> So he's like financial audits of like with people on X and he's like great just hammers like to borrow the pun. He just berates them. But these people just talk about how like often they're buying things with a firm and it whatever and it's just like way outside their budget but because it's 0% interest and you can defer the payment and it's just like wild how much this is woven into the consumer fabric. So I think overall not the best signals from the consumer economy on a broad basis and I think the reality is like when we talk about our performance to target so much of what we are working with our customers to do is to level set to normalized expectations and so I if I look at year-over-year growth I think I'm going to I'm going to try and pull some of those numbers here in a second to see see where we ended up but I think our data set mimics something very similar where I think we were up like 9% overall but orders were something like 1 or 2% % and so you saw a little bit of this almost like it's almost price growth a little bit baked in to what's happening but and massive year-over-year growth is not not to be expected. >> Okay. So then I I think like there's some a couple specific things. Let's talk like maybe tactically what the lessons were over the weekend, you know, regardless of like maybe which particular day, but like we had a couple, for instance, I'm thinking around we had one client who was used a promo code in in their offer and we're seeing like very poor year-over-year performance. They switched it to sitewide that basically saved their entire BFCM weekend. Anything else like a kind of along those lines that we can pull out? >> Yeah. So I think this is really the key is that one of the things going into this weekend and this is one of the things I noticed very distinctly between the cultures of the different organizations that we work with is that there are groups for whom the completion of the work is a task that has to be done where in other words they build and plan and their their event they do their design work they submit it and then it's sort of like what will be will be and that's the cultural disposition to the work and sometimes that can be effective and they tend to plan more. They tend to be further out in front, but they're also far less adaptive to where if you were to say, "Hey, Saturday we're changing the sale." That just would be like culturally an impossibility. Like that would not >> because of the way things work. And then alternatively, there's people who view the work as a mechanism to an outcome. And for them, like the work is not done until the outcome is achieved. And the actual relationship between those things is very different. And these are real cultural distinctions between the organizations we work with. And I'd say we try to push ourselves to be as much as possible in the first or the second camp where it's like the amount of work required is whatever is necessary to achieve the outcome. How many emails do you send? Well, however many you need to get to the goal. Is the offer good? Well, did it work? Those are the only things that we use to assess. So, if it's Saturday and your coupon code offer isn't working, yes, you rip down every ad, you change the homepage, you redesign all the emails, and you resend it. >> But that's hard to work. Not everybody's in that pattern of expectation. And so, but there were a number of cases where we were very diligently engaging with the customer around, hey, this is not resonating. Conversion rate is softer than last year. We tried to go a different route with the sale. we need to avert overhauling the entirety of the offer to get back on track, to get back on course. I know one brand in particular where it was on the new customer acquisition side, it was just the offer was not as strong relative to maybe what competitors were doing, looking and going, "Hey, there's better offers in the market for the same thing. We have to up our game." There are other instances where they were trying to do a gift with purchase and the gift with purchase just wasn't compelling. And sometimes you have to sort of look in the mirror, allow the conversion rate to be reality and go, "Hey, they don't want this." >> And we swept it out. We got it out of the way, went to a full sitewide discount and was able to recoup a lot of the goal. That was the screenshot I shared on X during the week. So that kind of engagement is what a partner like us exists to do. And what really the disposition of the best organizations is that forecasting is an exercise and execution. The job's not done till the outcome's achieved. And that's how you have to approach this weekend because you can make huge gains just making those kinds of pivots in the moment. >> Yeah. Well, I think like one lesson that I sort of pulled out of this was in in kind of in line with your with what you're saying here is that a lot of the times I think organizations are hesitant around that sort of pivot because at other parts of the year it doesn't pay off. I mean that specific type of p pivot where I'm saying let's rework the ads, let's change the offer, let's do this and that. Let's do it last minute. Let's do it right now. there's some sort of seasonal thing happening where people just aren't buying anything right now. So, it's it's whatever. On Black Friday, that's not the case at all. Everybody's just there ready to buy your stuff and so any that sort of pivot like any pivot in positive direction could have like a really outsized result. >> That's right. And and the reality is if you're not generating revenue, it's a you problem like cuz in this moment people are buying. And so to your point, there's a very high leverage value to be had against a new action. And if your conversion rate is down, it's not some macro problem. People are buying right now. We can see it everywhere. >> You have a problem. You need to fix your problem. And so I think it's a it's easiest to get people anchored in that in that time because it's so whereas if it's September 4th, it's easy to sort of be like, yeah, well, it's, you know, the season and then about and there's no like obvious trend that everybody's buying right now. But in this moment, it's fix it, get it better, make it happen, and don't wait, right, to to to get after it. >> Yeah. Well, let's let's maybe stay on. So, any other sort of type of lesson or sort of tactical learning that you feel like really stood out? >> Yeah. Delivery. I think metadata delivery. There was a lot of conversation about that as another thing which is that again this is another moment where there's the plan and then there's the backup plan and the backup to the backup plan which is that and this is the thing I think people have to start to do which is I think that every time somebody says oh my gosh meta screwed me or meta delivery didn't work. What I hear is, "Oh, you don't actually understand the game you're playing and you weren't prepared because you should assume on Black Friday, Cyber Monday weekend that you're going to have a delivery challenge at some point." >> Yeah. >> That inside of this massively complex system of everybody in the world trying to deliver as much ad spend as possible into a limited amount of feed that there's going to be some moment where it's going to be volatile or some moment where it's not going to work the way you want. >> It's like owning Bitcoin and being like, why is there a 40% drawback? Like, it's like you chose volatility. you you adopt it into a game that way. And so for us, it's like, oh, delivery stalled on these campaigns. We have these backup, highest volume, ready to go. Accelerated delivery for the next hour. Whatever action you need to take. When it's those peak moments, when it's Cyber Monday, Monday night in that last window, there's no going, oh, it's not delivering. What do I do? It's find some new way to get the delivery in, ready, go. And just being prepared to act that way that the expectation is chaos. the expectation is volatility. Not, oh my gosh, I can't believe Meta is not delivering. I think is another way to just sort of approach these with like, hey, we assume it's not going to work. We assume there's going to be a problem. Where do we go when the inevitable challenge occurs? >> Yeah. Well, it's interesting. Every other moment of the year, what we tend to say is that like, hey, media buying tactics are not really going to get you any marginal incremental gain, right? It's all about creative. It's all about the offer, blah blah blah. That obviously is still the case on Black Friday, Cyber Monday. However, what's added on top of that is that media buying tactics and small changes and being sort of clever about how you're constructing things actually can have an enormous impact. Right. >> Well, I think there's a huge unresolved question in our industry about the merits of spend on this weekend. So I've been trying to gather as much data as I can because Anmar who sits now two desks next to me here in the office who works with some of our bigger customers and I have been having this like we're trying to be thoughtful to build the best available truth we have about the incremental impact of ad spend in key moments like this in particular Black Friday Cyber Monday and we're continuing to hone in. We have a bunch of CLS studies happening. We're trying to gather some from other thirdparty partners. were trying to really just put this to under scrutiny because I do think that brands are committing millions of dollars to spend and it's just unclear exactly what would happen if they substantially increase it or decrease it in any given moment in an hour. Like what's the flow of revenue realization between spend in the morning versus evening? Like one of the things you see happen a lot is like on Cyber Monday morning as an example, you'll hear a lot of people start talking about overspending or Saturday morning you'd hear this. And it's just unclear to me that a bunch of spend in an hour without revenue realization is actually an indication that that's bad and how to handle that and interact in these really really tight windows. Like people people understand I think generally like the the lag effects of media over a 1 day 7-day 28 day effect but like what's the difference between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Black Friday. I think that's less clear in terms of the realization of value in curves in that way. So I think that there's this is actually the highest leverage media buying moment of the whole year. Like I saw there's a media buyer on Twitter that I think a lot of people follow that was like this is the easiest day of the year and I just think it's so functionally wrong is that this is actually the most complex highest volatile environment where media buyers could either waste or make you millions of dollars with good decision-m. >> Yeah. I mean, I know we had we had a instance, I think this was on Saturday, right, where there was like a weird spike in spend in the morning and one of our buyers basically like it h it overspent in the morning and then this was Sunday I think and then by the end of the day by midnight she had essentially fixed it by working all day and taking basically like a laundry list essay length number of actions to get spend exactly where it needed to be. So it's like in other words not the easiest day by any means. Yeah. Very complex. you have huge budgets and so like if you do encounter any of these errors like o overd delivery or underd delivery you end up off course a lot right and so I think that that like that then what you need to do to bring back that into correct position is really challenging and so yeah >> it does it it requires discipline and maintenance and attention and presence and you know there I posted a picture of our team we had a lot of people out in Dubai >> and Dubai is 12 hours ahead right so you can imagine like cyber Monday the really the the the action starts at noon PST. That's midnight in Dubai. And so they were up all night and there was this picture of them sort of all just like collapsed on the couch the next day with a bunch of pizza boxes laid out. And it was like that's the reality of being a media on these days. It's a high leverage. It matters. Your clients expect attention to detail. They want constant communication. They want to know you're there. And your job is to sort of ride the reins of the spend and make sure that it makes it home safely. >> Yeah. Okay. Let's let's get back to the numbers here. I guess. Yeah. Any anything else that was particularly kind of stood out or was sort of an outlier here or or anything about 2025 that felt substantly different from previous years? >> Yeah, I think to me Cyber Monday was the one that I was like and I I'm going to have to dive in a little bit more where generally speaking it is as good if not better than Black Friday in many cases, but >> looking [clears throat] like returning customer revenue was minus one to target. It seemed like we had exhausted that a little bit. total spend was softer five minus 5 percent to target. Meta in particular was behind. So it just looked like there was places where Monday just didn't have the yield that it had in previous. I think overall we were like right on target. So point plus 007 a target on Monday but every other day was a beat to expectation. So a little bit of the distribution I think was was different than maybe we had had initially thought. So that was that was something where it seemed seemed to be like what I wonder what let me look at Saturday compared to Monday real fast. So Saturday total rev there Monday. Yeah, Monday was still bigger but not quite. Usually it's almost twice as large. It was looks like it was like closer to 60% bigger this year. So maybe a little bit more distribution across the weekend was just interesting as a primary notice for me. >> Yeah. All right. Well, anything anything else you want to hit on this? >> So, if we if we take this sentiment that growth is a byproduct of AOV and inflation and pricing increase, substantial increase in buy now pay later. I do think we continue to have this weird and this is like a cultural behavioral norm that goes all the way into the however you view the federal government spending which is that >> we the consumer clearly appears to be committed to spending. maybe absent and beyond the actual underlying health of their financial reality. And >> I just I do wonder as we sit in this sort of like uh weird semifrothy state still with all the AI expectations, etc., etc., the tariff thing still being unclear to me how this comes to roost. Mhm. >> I know I can be dispositionally a little bit of a doomer and that's not a cool thing to be, [clears throat] >> but something feels off a little bit about the amount of spending given the surrounding environment. And the the buy now pay later thing is just I just don't like that. I don't like it as a as a as a mechanism in our lives. Every time I use it, I feel like I'm punishing my future self. That's what it feels like to me. Every time I click it, and I I don't click it very often, Richard, for the Of course. Of course. No, it's it's definitely it seems like a sort of a very specific example of this sort of broader trend that we've been seeing of of I mean generally like credit card debt going up this has been happening since like last year around this time just generally speaking people behaving as if they are in better economic circumstances than they actually are. >> That's right. And that that feels like there's something about us dispositionally as a people in the United States that is this like s almost entitlement to a lifestyle that might be beyond the means that we presently have. And there's just something there that I think is is concerning to me. And I I listen to these conversations. Again, I'm going back to this stupid just cuz I was I had to drop my kids off to football practice and so I went to the driving range last night and I just listened to random podcasts while I'm there and I was listening to these people and there's just like it's like a delusion that like oh it's fine we'll just keep acrewing this debt and keep buying things and we have to have these this specific betting and of course we have to go to Disneyland and of course we have to and so what it feels like is and look the advertising industry is a big mechanism for propping up this desire and need. So, don't get me wrong, I think it's really powerful, but I just it feels like there's a layer brewing that doesn't feel sustainable in this in this consumer economy. >> Interesting. All right. Well, so I mean, I think that's maybe a good overall recap of what happened is like we did pretty well. It was a pretty good Black Friday, but there are some some signs that should cause us to worry a little bit over the upcoming year or just drive kind of drive home the point that like the fundamentals are still what matter and making short-term decisions that play into a long-term outcome and all those sorts of things that we've been harping on are more important than it. >> The other fun fact I heard 900% increase in traffic from LLM year. >> Interesting. So that continued shopping trend of just engagement via chat. I know. Did you do much shopping through chat QBT? Do you use it at all? >> Not really. But I will say like just anecdotally I'll get a lot of people coming to us like say for our admission program that found us on chat GPT. Yeah. >> So it is that that's really kicked up in the last probably like six months I would say. >> Yeah, for sure. I I I just think that there I know I do and I was having this debate with Shireen online. I I use it for everything like I everything for shopping. So, I find the experience to be be pretty good. So, that's another thing to >> Yeah. >> to keep it at it. >> Something to keep in mind. All right. Cool. All right. Well, I think I think we can wrap it there unless there's something else you want to hit. Yeah. For everybody everybody else out there, happy BFM. I hope it was good for everyone. And obviously, like, hey, 2026 is around the corner. My god, it seems like too many, but here we are. 2026 is around the corner. It's time to be forecasting if [music] you're not already.
