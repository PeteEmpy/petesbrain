We have uh Dennis had across $147 clients for Thursday through Monday, approximately $127 million in revenue. Uh just a hair under $25 million in media spend. I had an average of 5.1 me across the data set and $40.2 million in contribution margin. Uh, so we got a we got a big chunk of data that we're in the process of we're really beginning to tangle with and understand what what were the trends. I I have a couple things on my mind that we're I'm working with the data team now to to sort out and they're really all in relation to this is the first Black Friday Cyber Monday in the post Andromeda world on the meta side >> and one thing that we've observed really all year long is the the efficacy of UGC style content creator video on the platform. >> All right folks, welcome back to the DTOC [music] hotline. This is your direct connection to hot takes to cold truths to real ecom advice from [music] the best in the business. I'm your host Richard, Professor Gaffin. Now call or text 866 DOC2263. Get your brewing ecom questions answered. [music] 866 382263. You can leave a voicemail, shoot us a text, ask us [music] whatever is on your mind DDC wise. Our operators are standing by now. Speaking of which, we got them both here. First up, I'm gonna go with Luke the weatherman Austin here coming in live from CTC studios in sunny sunny sunny Southern California. Luke, what's going on? >> Oh, it is good to be back home, but going through a bit of a bit of bit of travel withdrawal. Tony and I and a few other folks from CDC HQ cruise out to Dubai for about a 5day trip over Black Friday, Cyber Monday and hung out with Joy Chararma and our accelerator team. And it was it was incredible. Just great time with everyone in person. >> Did all the Dubai things. Did all the Cyber Monday scaling and overnights necessary to accomplish that. So it's good to be back. Sad to leave. >> It's awesome. And of course, we also have Tony the Chopper Chop. So you've been in Dubai as well, Tony. >> We did not take a chopper. >> No choppers were involved at all. Huh. >> No choppers. Flew on the largest airplane I've ever been on. It was like four stories. I'm not sure. >> Um Luke did did make an attempt to go to the the penthouse area up top. >> Nice. In the plane, >> in the plane. Yeah. Made it made it made it there. >> CTC didn't spring for the lounge, huh? >> Made it to the bar in the sky. No, CTC did not spring for first class tickets on Emirates Airlines. Just Just for the record. >> We're not there yet. All right, cool. Well, glad to have you back states. Maybe at the end we can talk a little bit about Dubai takeaways. But what we want to do first is answer a couple questions here and one mainly which is of course what else would which is the following which is hey guys I'm curious what your biggest takeaways from BFCM this year are. So in other words what was different this year than last year what you think what maybe trends pointing to and then what stories we have from over the weekend that are be interesting to kind of unpack here. So I know you both have a lot of them. So why don't we start with you Tony. Well, so, so let me just kind of set the table here. We've been a aggregating some of this data. So, we have uh data set across 147 clients for Thursday through Monday, approximately $127 million in revenue, uh just a hair under $25 million in media spend. I had an average of 5.1 me across the data set and $40.2 million in contribution margin. Uh, so we got a we got a big chunk of data that we're in the process of really beginning to tangle with and understand what what were the trends. I I have a couple things on my mind that we're I'm working with the data team now to to sort out and they're really all in relation to this is the first Black Friday Cyber Monday in the post Andromeda world on the meta side >> and one thing that we've observed really all year long is the the efficacy of UGC style content creator video on the platform and I I'm I I'm on a quest to prove disprove a theory that this year our investment into video and specifically UGC content creator format ads is larger than it's ever been before as a function of the the Andromeda updates on meta. So a couple of things that that stand out before I kick it over to Luke. We the early data suggests that we we our clients in partnership with us and and their existing creative produced orders of magnitude more creative. So, some of my early data is showing three 4x more creative year-over-year to actually get to get to the results that we got to. And then also an interesting pattern, the new kid on the block loven represents the third largest invested channel in our data set out of Meta Google, Pinterest, Snapchat, YouTube, and Tik Tok. So, a lot a sign significant amount of resources coming into this new platform during this moment. >> Yeah. And as I talked about a little bit with Taylor on our earlier e-commerce playbook, our Apploven results smashed our target by a lot. So on almost every metric we were within like let's say 10% of of goal with Apploven, it really feels like it overperformed. So I'm sure there's more to unpack there as well, but let's let's let's go to Luke real quick. Let's give a give us a BFM takeaway. >> Yeah, I'll I'll do another macro takeaway that's to build on what Tony Sharon and then I think we'll get into some of the tactics that frame up that frame this up. But so Tony showed across our data set sort of aggregate what we're seeing takeaways in channel macro in terms of year-over-year and what we're seeing. So this is based on our data data from no commerce as well that they that Jeremiah and the team there were we're were sharing out overall 9.1% year-over-year growth based on that data set from Black Friday 2024 slightly down from 10.2% a year ago. are we're seeing we saw similar outcomes in terms of our data set on aggregate as well which which aligned with with that. So you know somewhere in the the neighborhood of 8 to 10% year-over-year growth in aggregate and then order volume was basically flat year-over-year in that data set. We saw a bit of growth in our data set relative to order volume. But what that indicates is a lot of that a lot of that growth came came from higher prices, higher average order value, right? Rather than the order volume being higher. And then there's other things going on with macro in the macro landscape related to the usage of buy now pay later up about 9% overall 41% of shoppers a 16 to 24 using by now pay later. So I think there's there are always the aggregate data is helpful in sort of framing the the sentiment more broadly and what we saw and it's completely unhelpful in framing up the individual outcomes that we saw Black Friday, Cyber Monday because those were the there those are all over the place in terms of in terms of the outcome but I think helpful for us to understand what happened in the space 8 to 10% year-over-year growth on average and the broader economic sentiment as we think about some of the things Tony shared in terms of additional creative output, the growth of the media channels, and and what really jumped out to me from these two data points is is the continuation of a trend that we've been seeing, which is brands are needing to find relief, margin relief in the business because of these factors related to tariffs, the macro sentiment, the economy, etc. And where that's going is if you start to cut media spend, that's just like it's it that's going to come to haunt you at some point, right? Cut the media spend, your new customer revenue starts to drop. And so what's necessary is keep the media spin going increase the creative volume to get there but find it's necessary to find relief in other areas increasing your prices and then and then and your fixed cost and your and your your yeah your fixed costs what what's going into the into the people tech infrastructure that's running your business so that you can put more into creative and more in media to counteract these trends. So that's that's the that's the continuation of the trend that we've seen and we've been sort of framing up in conversations around how we're evolving our service offering to be able to index against those levers of more money into more media spend and more creative rather than the the fixed cost of people the tech stock etc which is going to be necessary for brands moving forward to continue to see growth and hopefully buck some of this trend. Okay, let's let's jump from the macro into the micro. Then you mentioned that it was some individual sort of circumstances or individual examples where there was sort of some tactical insight that could potentially have a little broader application. So I'll kind of like let's ping pong back and forth between you and drop a tactical insight for us. So let's go uh let's go Tony. What's a what's a tactical insight really a story over the weekend that would really striking? I mean, I don't know that this is new news for for anyone listening here, but the the necessity to monitor media pacing very granularly by by the hour and at least and the relationship between the the media spend pacing that you're seeking to be at and the revenue and efficiency pacing of the business. So, we had more than one situation where we we were unable to at first get the media spend pacing out of meta that we were seeking. And the the tactical solution to solve that problem in many cases is to duplicate the campaign and trying different different bidding tactics actually to actually get the media spend to go. But the the the moral of the story is like it's not enough to set your campaigns and go do something else on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It really requires like minute-by-minute vigilance purely because of the the pace at the moment. So yeah, I'm not sure that that's a new news story, but it was a common theme for us in in many accounts. >> Luke, there's something I was going to say connected to what Tony just said, but I'll start with this one and then maybe will come back to me. So offer strategy being one of the main levers that we all know is critical during this this time period. >> What occurred to me based on what we were seeing across our data set and the for the brands that were winning is the error bars sort of the like disparate outcomes that are available when thinking about offer strategy and the impact that it can have on the business. And I think the temptation is to think that the revenue outcome is baked. Like whether you slice your offer one way or the other, 30% off, or it's going to be, you know, buy two get one or whether it's, you know, 3 days only, or whether it's the whole month of November, like the the temptation could be that you're just going to kind of get the same outcome and you pull some revenue forward or maybe not, and it's going to be sort of the same like it's baked, you know? And what occurred to me based on the results we were seeing this weekend is that is one of the farthest thing from things from the truth in this time period. The brands that we saw winning the most were the ones that had a really had really clear urgency and tight time constraints around their offer strategy. Where over the past couple years, I'll say like two to three years, there's been more of a trend in the direction of have a consistent offer that's easy to access. you can run paid media against consistently. You don't have to change all of your creatives. Run it earlier so you have more time to run. And then it's like, okay, for Cyber Week, those 7 to 10 days, we're going to run 30% off sitewide. And that's the thing we're going to do and message 30% off sitewide. And the brands that we saw winning this year were ones that actually opted to tighten the time horizon against their offers who didn't pull some of that revenue earlier in the week or earlier in the month, but maybe did a VIP launch Thursday and then their biggest day, Black Friday, and then through the weekend. So, tighten the tightened the urgency around it, but then two had tons of mini peaks over the course of Cyber Weekend that they were building into their offer strategy in the form of novelty in the offers. Whether that's doorbusters and you're adding new styles every day that get sold out, whether that's tearing up your offer over the course of the weekend, it's flash sales on Saturday and then Sunday and then your biggest offer Monday. And it gives you different ways to message the offer that you're driving and create novelty rather than consistency. It's it's really an art form to be able to find out like to identify the offer that we can run and that can give paid media sort of the consistency that that engine needs and you're not switching out creative every day and you know like that's but that in terms of your email messaging and in terms of your own channels email and SMS messaging that you can create novelty and urgency around and then your website and how that's framed can drive it as well. And so heading into next year, I think that's that is the one thing I would say is like there is a lot there's just a w much larger range of outcomes that I think many brands understand for Black Friday, Cyber Monday that's directly connected to interesting their offer strategy is over that time period and lends to the strengths of each of the channels and built in that way. And we we're actually putting together a database of like the the the cyber weekend the cyber week offers that we saw work best of 2025 and we'll we'll make that available at some point for folks because it's it always interesting seeing how many different ways you can slice and dice those seven days and how many brands do it so differently and see a wide range of outcomes as a result. >> All right, cool. So, one thing I'll just say like to your point, Luke, because I think it's interesting is anecdotally for me anyway, this is like one of the first BFCMs where this sort of like general cultural knowledge of Black Friday, Cyber Monday sort of being too long felt like it was a little bit more in the guys than before. In other words, like my in-laws were like, "Ah, I don't know about Black Friday." They run the things the whole week like I don't know if you have to shop today, whatever. My parents being like, "What?" That sort of thing. And I wonder if like part of what you're alluding to is like it's not necessarily that it's too long per se, but that the Black Friday is not special enough or something and that's kind of the fundamental difference between the people who won and the people who lost. Is that fair to say? >> Yeah. And I I think it's like you kind of think about like an adoption curve and as sort of like oscillating a different direction where like call it seven years ago it was it was less long in aggregate in terms of that time period the perception and it's slowly like more and more brands have become like ah let's run for the month or let's run for the week and like let's add more consistency rather than a different black Friday offer versus cyber Monday offer and and there was arbitrage it there's just not arbitrage in that anymore because that's where I think the majority is sitting now and the ones the ones that aren't are actually oscillating the other way, seeing where the majority is and actually driving in the other direction to, hey, let's let's actually push for urgency and tight time constraints and go that direction. And then at some point it'll oscillate in a different direction or back in the back the other way. But I think over the next couple years, we're going to see more of a trend to getting back to the heart of Black Friday, Cyber Monday. The the challenge is like what you do is you introduce more revenue risk for sure. So like you have to be able to stomach that and you have to be able to create additional revenue peaks for yourself at other times of the year when you start to constrain the time period because if you if you run the offer for two weeks like you just have more levers to pull on and you can like gives you a couple like okay we saw the first week's performance now let's change things up for the second week or add this in if you're doing a thing for two days right like you got to do the thing really well otherwise you're going to have to have some backup options so that can come e either in the form of additional revenue peaks later in December early in the year or packing a parachute for Cyber Monday and your Friday, Black Friday offer, which we sell for a number of brands as well, which is let's run this offer, let's start our plan for the weekend, but we got a parachute packed with ads, everything we need for the landing page, everything we need for the email to switch the offer over to this higher outcome if we're not seeing what we planned and we can pull the parachute and we can see the the higher outcome as a result, >> which we which we absolutely had to do in one one specific case with with a with a brand that had one of their top selling SKs that that had an offer and they started with one offer that that turned out not turned out to not have the response rate that that we were that we were looking for. So Tuk's parachute packing metaphor >> I like that analog >> the parachute was unpacked. >> Yeah. >> In order to change the direct trajectory. >> Yeah. And that made and I think I was talking maybe with Brian or Taylor about this on the pod but or on the e-commerce playbook but that was like a transformative moment too, right? like the the amount of difference that those types of like hourby- hour decisions can make and those sort of like triage decisions can make is like is massive. And in this particular instance, if it's the one I'm thinking of, they were able to switch the offer and that basically saved the entire debt at up to a certain point. They were trending like 20% behind or whatever. They switched the offer and they were able to make up everything and actually kind of crush their target. So it's just yeah a good lesson in being able to be flexible and then just like the value of that day and you know how much things can change on that specific >> Yeah. Exactly. >> Yeah. Right. So like you know from a media perspective like our our role in this whole thing is to make sure the media dollars get get invested and tactically we have these things these different levers to pull in order to compel that to happen. Good. But the precursor to that is product and the offer >> and this the the combination of those two things can yield like dramatically different different outcomes. >> Cool. All right. More more tactical observations if you have Luke Tony anything else pop out >> me media investment the app piece of the story is is really interesting for the >> for one standout reason. So the media investment follows a pretty a pretty normalized curve. So Thursday then Friday is the largest then drop down for Saturday, Sunday, then Monday is is a bump bump up but less than Friday. So the maximum app the peak app investment actually happened on on Monday and it I think it I think it's telling me a it's telling us a story of the efficacy of that media throughout the weekend as as people as our as media teams worked to deploy those dollars and we saw the investment increase throughout throughout the throughout the weekend. It actually peak on Monday. >> Yeah. Oh, so that's an Let me to summarize that back to you. So like Apploven did better just generally did better on Cyber Cyber Monday. >> Spent more for sure. >> Spend more. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. >> Interesting. Well, I just I'm always curious like what what the human dynamic of that is. It's like you're back at work so you're >> screwing around on your phone more. Like what's the >> No, I don't think it's that. No. No. I think I think we we are just scratching the surface of what's available through that inventory pool. So I think what I think what the story I'm making up is that throughout the weekend people were developing more and more confidence in the channel's ability to return and affect revenue and as a result ended up moving more media dollars in into the channel in a way that in a way that was is different than the normal curve. Uh Luke, >> what I what I think are going to be the main takeaways heading into Black Friday Cyber Monday next year as well as future sale moments to brand for brands is to Tony's opening point clarity and transparency and tracking on an hourly basis just the standard. If you're if that's not happening and you don't have visibility into revenue, spend, contribution margin, and then spend and and return by channel on an hourly basis and targets that map with those, >> you do not have enough. Yeah. You do not have enough you do not have enough visibility and you are going to leave margin dollars on the table either to the upside or the downside. And so only at that level of visibility do you have the visibil? Do you have the do you see what you need to be able to make the accurate decisions? two is novelty and offer strategy coming it's coming back like tighter time frames really unique ways at running offers that are really strategic and that cut through the noise and then three which is this is the sort of novel one to tie tie it off I think is email and SMS communication sort of matching the uniqueness of the offer strategy and and being something that people are more comfortable leading into a higher volume of sends because There's different ways to talk about your sale than just, hey, it's 30% off. Hey, reminder 30% off. Hey, last chance 30% off. You can talk about these things as, hey, this hero product of ours is now included in the offer. Hey, this collection that you've been browsing is now included this offer. Even though the offer is consistent, you can talk about it a million different ways. And there are and we even saw brands we were in the office on Friday. We even saw brands over the course of the day looking at feedback they're getting from customers and things customers are saying and then firing off emails in the middle of the day related to those specific topics, right? And and even playing into it, right? Like, hey, I know this is the seventh time that you've heard from me today. This I just believe in it this much, right? And if you like if a concern is unsubscribe rates and and that getting you flagged in terms of deliverability like a message like that is just not going it's that's not going to be harmful in most cases, right? That's very thoughtful, very personal, very relational and it's the founder or whoever's owning the marketing channel like responding in real time to the customers and to specific things in the email that then just you're talking about the offer in a unique way and more time. So that's that's what we want to see more of in future sale periods for our brands and in the next year is the hourly tracking visibility offer strategy and the novelty of that narrative and then speaking about it in as many ways as as possible across media as many channels as possible scaling up left and right and then across email and SMS and and and doing that in a way that cuts the noise and makes it more unique than than it candidly has been over the past couple years especially where there's been a lot more consist consistency that's sort of been prioritized over novelty. >> Yeah. Okay. Let's So, one other thing that I wanted to talk about with you specifically, Tony, because I think this'd be interesting to hear your take on and I talked a little bit with Taylor about how on over BFCM like one of our kind of consistent tropes is that creative is the most important, offer is the most important. That obviously is still the case as you pointed out Luke over BFCM. But Black Friday is one of the few instances where we can actually say like, "Hey, like media buying tactics actually maybe make a difference here or like very specific clever like, hey, we need to unlock more volume here. Retargeting has been smashing for one of my accounts. Let's like try that." You know, these sort of like little ways to kind of game the system, so to speak, to gain to get more of an edge. And I was curious, a what's your general thoughts on that and b whether there's any kind of specific instances of that you saw on Black Friday that were interesting. >> Yeah. Yeah. 100%. So I I think like there's there's this value in a certain amount of value in consistency and patience through throughout the year especially like consider that all the media platforms like you know whether unless you're optimizing against one day click like for the most part you're optimizing on some sort of click window that's like more than a day. So if you're making you're making doing a lot of decision making, you know, in intraday in a sort of a BAU period, you're in some ways fighting against the algorithm. Black Friday and Cyber Monday and really throughout the weekend all bets are off as far as you know, set it, forget it. And in some cases, the the posture really shifts because the primary mission on in this moment in time is to deploy the media budget. the the only thing that the number one thing you can't do is let the media budget not not get delivered. So there's all sorts of things that that we do tactically. I think I think probably the the most consistent tactical approach at least across CTC is we we use a lot of cost cap, a lot of minros, a lot of efficiency based bidding through throughout the year. And it's great. It it really helps us control for downside and is really predictable to come into a sale moment like Black Friday and Cyber Monday without having some volume based bidding campaigns packed in your parachute to use Luke's use Luke's metaphor here is a mistake. So I would say that and this this is actually part of the the analysis that we're going to we're going to run back is how much of the media actually got delivered through through highest volume campaigns. But I'm going to estimate that it's somewhere between 30 40 maybe upwards of 50%. >> You absolutely need this to to be able to to fight in this in this auction. So, and the other thing that that we see a lot of tactically is we sort of joke about a little bit, but add adding zeros to the campaign budgets, right? There sometimes more more than one zero. So, duplicating campaigns, adding zeros, all of these are like sending signals, screaming at the platform, deliver my dollars. Yeah. Yeah. You must deliver. And there's like one other one other thing that I think is really important here from a media buyer perspective and it's paired with this idea of you know hourly tracking which is the the understanding of if you are looking at hourly tracking on Cyber Monday in the morning and your ROS is at target you are not spending enough. You have not delivered enough into that moment. And so this idea of really pushing on the delivery, doing everything you possibly can to push on the delivery during those moments in time, duplicating campaigns, highest volume, anything, anything that you got. Lifetime budgets is another is another little media buyer hacky thing. So run set up a campaign with a lifetime budget for just that day on highest volume and that that will compel delivery. But yeah, the the behavior the behavior is unique in this moment in time in line with how how much different it is versus any other time of the year. >> Yeah. No, I mean I was just really struck like talking talking to you, talking to Taylor, whatever how much this really is our Super Bowl. Like the one day of the year, the Super Bowl is the one day of the year every single person cares about football. This is like the one, two, three days of the year where every single person cares about shopping, particularly online. And that's not the environment that we're in most of the time. And so I think that's kind of like the the fundamental Yeah. fundamental context has changed so much that you have to approach but Okay, cool. Let's I think we we're good. Put it there. So I want to end with observations. What was the most interesting thing about Dubai? That's what I'm curious. Start start with you. >> Dubai is simultaneously the most interesting place and the most uninteresting place I've been to. You while you're there like this is the progression of you get you get to Dubai. the the first day you get there, you're like, "Whoa, look at all these buildings. Like, it's so nice and modern." And then and then what you start to do like the next two days is sort of like there's a weird feeling about this place. I'm not really sure what it is, but I feel weird. And and then by the end what settles in is like the you know like the parallel might be like in New York City you have like all this bedrock and then you like talk about some place like Istanbul, Turkey or something like there's just like all this history over centuries that sort of forms the foundation of the city and what's been built and while we were there in Dubai it was the 51st anniversary of the United Arab Emirates um formation I believe. I I I hope that's right. And but it was the 51st first anniversary of that happening. That's just so new. That's like yesterday in relation to these things and the amount of growth that's happened. And so it's just been sort of like it's the the fabrication and sort of veneer that exists over the place relative to the amount of infrastructure. like every building you're like you're on the 77th floor of this building overlooking like a drone show that's like going over the ferris wheel on the man-made island you know the palm you like it's a fascinating dynamic >> interesting Tony >> what's the weirdest thing about Dubai >> it was remarkably difficult for me to come across some baklava >> oh that's a bummer that's not what you want but did you get some >> the book at at the airport lounge on the way out. >> Yeah. >> Airport lounge. >> Okay. >> Finally made it out. >> Yeah. No, I I sort I sort of second what Luke said. It's like it's obviously super polished and I looked out my hotel window hotel or was a restaurant. I can't remember. Looked out in my field of view. I counted 14 cranes. >> Oh wow. >> Like literally every two inches in my field of view was a was a crane. So the the the infrastructure piece of it is is is striking and it's it's it's really quite it's quite beautiful to look at. There is something about the there's something that it's like I don't want to say inauthentic cuz that that sounds bad but I I I crave like experiences that feel really real and and I think there's there's there's other places where I've I've had that. Here's one other thing that one other thing that was interesting. >> Very few you like cross intersections. So it's not it's not a place where it's like a really walkable city and when you're driving around there's not a lot of left turns. There's just all these loops everywhere. So several times we like missed our turn or whatever else we ended up on this super long about. So I don't know just an interesting infrastructure >> tra traffic control system out there. >> Yeah. Fascinating. Yeah, all I know about it is the overhead shot from the Apple TV screen saver. So, all right. Well, that's going to do it for us. We lost Luke. But remember, if you if you want your questions answered on the pod call, leave us a voicemail 866D TOC 22263, shoot us a text there.
