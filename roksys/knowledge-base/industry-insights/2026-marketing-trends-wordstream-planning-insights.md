## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: General marketing trends and planning for 2026
**Reason**: This appears to be a broad marketing planning article that likely covers multiple channels and trends. While it may include some PPC/Google Ads insights given WordStream's focus on paid search, the title and description suggest general marketing content rather than Google Ads-specific strategies. Without deeper content visibility, it rates as medium relevance.
