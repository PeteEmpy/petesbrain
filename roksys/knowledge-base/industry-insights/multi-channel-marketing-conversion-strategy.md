## Transcript

There's lots of ways to get traffic. And back then I was helping out with their SEO, helping out with paid ads, doing a little bit of social, taking product pictures, kind of doing it all. And I focused more on SEO because I thought, who doesn't want free traffic? And over the years, I worked at different advertising agencies as a director of SEO and before work, after working on my lunch break, so I'd work on my own company. Eventually, I was able to build that up to quit my job and been doing this ever since. Just helping people tap into that free traffic from Google. But over the years, I realized that traffic is traffic and traffic doesn't mean conversions and sales and leads and phone calls. And that's what business owners want is conversions. They don't really care about traffic. So, I started looking at more holistically and looking at like remarketing ads, trying to follow people around, keeping yourself top of mind since half your traffic is probably going to leave that bounce rate and just trying to be more holistic with it. And that's where probably in 2013 I started doing a little bit more with the paid ads and social and just trying to bring it all together because they all work together to help drive those conversions.
