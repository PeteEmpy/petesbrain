## Google clears $32B Wiz acquisition hurdle

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Google's $32B acquisition of cloud security firm Wiz has cleared U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review, bringing the tech giant closer to finalizing. **Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport confirmed the milestone** at a Wall Street Journal event, though it still requires additional approvals before closing in early 2026.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The acquisition amount rose from **Google's initial $23B in 2024**, which Wiz rejected, to $32B when talks resumed in early 2025.

* Wiz provides cloud security solutions that scan and protect cloud infrastructure, making it a strategic asset for **Google Cloud as enterprises migrate sensitive workloads to cloud environments requiring robust security frameworks.**

* **The timeline spans nearly two years from initial discussions to expected closure, with antitrust permissions representing a major milestone,** but additional regulatory approvals are still pending before the acquisition completes.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This acquisition signals Google's aggressive push to compete with Microsoft and Amazon in enterprise cloud security. For enterprise leaders, this consolidation could mean **enhanced security tools within Google Cloud** but potentially altered vendor landscapes as major platforms acquire independent security companies.

**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How Instacart cut engineering time by 20% with AI

* Instacart, a US grocery delivery platform,** faced slow product development cycles **that delayed launches and a lack of innovation speed across engineering teams.

* The issue came from **manual coding, debugging, and testing workflows** that consumed hours of repetitive effort within large, complex codebases.

* Through its internal **Project Tomato initiative**, Instacart embedded AI coding assistants like Ava and Cursor to automate refactoring, debugging, and test generation.

* The result was a **20% increase in engineering velocity**, freeing developers to focus on design quality and faster product delivery.
