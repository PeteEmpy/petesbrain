## Transcript

The question becomes, okay, well, if we have these specific gaps at this point in time, then to use some more Luke language, what are the units of growth that we can apply to these specific gaps? And so for us, it's there's lots of things you can do. It kind of boils down into some pretty simple things, marketing, calendar moments, creative, and the other thought that occurred to me when this caller's question was spoken is potentially looking at some channel expansion. So let me give you four example. Let's say we have a revenue gap in forecasted for the Black Friday Cyber Monday period. Okay? And we have a certain amount of creative that we've already commissioned to produce. Well, one of the things that we're doing for our clients right now, right now at this moment in time, is we're exploring incrementality testing into into AppL and into some channel expansion. What do we get to do with that? Well, we get the measurement right and then for in the situations where we we find this to be a channel that we believe can create the financial outcome that we need for a particular account, we don't need more new creative. We just get to deploy more media dollars against the creative that we already have. So, hypothetically, this madeup brand, let's say there's a $100,000 gap in the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, we go and do some incrementality testing. we we get to a target for app 111. Now the unit of growth equals deploy 304 maybe $50,000 into app 11 in a net new channel during this period aka gap close. This episode of the e-commerce playbook is brought to you by Vermont.

I'm your host Richard the Professor Gaff. Now I want to say a couple words. If you're hearing this from the e-commerce playbook feed, we're putting our DTOC hotline [music] episode for this week on that feed as well as a little bonus. So you can all get listening because we think you all should be listening to this because some of the again hottest takes, coldest truths and realist ecom advice in the game is happening on this podcast right here right now. So a couple words about how this works. First off, this is a real hotline. You can call, you can text 866DTC2263 to get your burning ecom questions answered. So again, that's 866 3822263. You can leave us a voicemail. You can shoot us a text, ask whatever's on your mind, DDC wise. Our operators, like I always say, are standing by. Now, speaking of which, we got our two operators here right now. We got Tony the Chopper Chop. We got Luke the weatherman Austin who are here to answer all of your questions. I'll start with you, Tony. Tony, what's going on with you today, man? >> Oh, you know, just a massive global internet outage at AWS. the the infrastructure layer that underpins it all. [laughter] >> Yeah, >> it's been it's been interesting. So, we had we use several tools at CTC, one of them being a sauna for all of our project management, various whatevers. And so, we came in this morning to where is everything? >> Yeah. >> These sorts of things remind me of when I was a kid in Michigan. It's almost like a snow day. Yeah. >> Not quite though. [laughter] >> Right. Right. You almost get to take off because nothing's working. Yeah. It's like it's definitely as we record this the AWS outage is in full swing now. This could be like maybe the last thing that gets recorded before all the entire internet falls down. So this or collapses rather. So this could be sort of a cultural artifact. I don't know. >> It's like the first video that was ever uploaded to YouTube. Maybe this will be the end [laughter] of it all. >> Yeah. What's his name at the San Diego Zoo? And the last one is going to be the three of us talking ecom. [snorts] So we'll see. I don't know. Luke, what's going on with you, dude? >> How are you coping? Well, I'm I'm I'm in a very existential state now based on this based on this discussion. >> I do this I do this to Luke all the time like what does any of it mean? >> We we say to Tony about [laughter] it's a once a quarter. It's once a quarter is the frequency is Tony got to come back down from the clouds. You spent a little too much time in the clouds. It's time to come back down. Not not all [clears throat] the way down. That's fine. But somewhere somewhere in breathing altitude level. >> Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Well, hey, maybe the lesson of this AWS thing is we're all spending too much time in the cloud, right? Yeah, Luke saw where I was going with that. [laughter] That's right. So, Tony, you might end up being right. I don't know. All right. Well, okay. As long as the internet's still working and you're still listening to this wherever you are, we're going to jump right into it. So, we only really have one voicemail today that we want to get into because it's a complex question that is crucially important as we go into the holiday season, which we're already in the full swing of. November's almost here. So, I'm going to play that right now and then we'll kick it over to our our operators here and see what they have to say. So, here we go. >> Hello. I have a quick question going into holiday for the operators. How would you identify and fill your Q4 revenue gaps? Thank you. >> A short question with a with a long potential answer here. How do you identify and fill Q4 revenue gaps? So, Luke, why don't we start with you? >> There's so many layers so many layers to this question. So, I like how the question was framed, which is you're you're identifying a gap that exists, right? And then and then the actions to to fill it. But there's an assertion that there's a definition of where we're at and where we're supposed to be and a gap that exists between the two, right? Rather than, hey, we want to like, you know, could we get a little more out of this thing, right? Sort of question. So identifying the gap is once you have clarity on that I think that the actions will will naturally follow and so I think the identification of the gap needs to be done in the same in the same way but there's a lot of different frameworks that people do this one is they might start to look at a channel like look at Google analytics you know contribution from each other channel on a percentage basis and sort of see like where's the channel the channel level fall off based on last click going or am I lock rocker box MTA but where we where we start in terms of understanding the gap that exists is by tying it to actions that we can actually go and take, right? So, so knowing that the paid social last click revenue is 12% this quarter versus the same quarter last year it was 14% of the total like that it's a it's a much more challenging sort of exercise in that regard. So the gap has been identified and then what we're going to do first is understand if the gap is coming from our new customer cohort or returning customer cohort and then from there we're going to decompose what actions need to be taken as a result of which they're going to be really really different. If the gap that we're seeing is coming from the expectation of a returning customer cohort then that's likely going to lead to a set of actions in relation to our to our own and earned channels. email and and SMS specifically are the main levers that we can pull. So, additional volume of campaigns that we're pushing, additional foot flows that we're going to be building out to be able to execute in in the coming in the coming time period. A lot of conversations we're having right now around duplicating all the core flows and updating the messaging and the universal banners to be BFCM oriented. So, you have flows cloned for every single one of your automations that has BFCM or offer specific messaging over the course of November and December. So that's going to be a big lever as well as just adding in additional uh email campaign sets to subsets of your audience or different segments to be able to to be able to capitalize on that. And then another action that may result from it is meta retention campaign. So understanding if you can push into your lapsing or your churn customer cohorts within meta. And then and then the final one is sort of ensuring that your Google brand or you're capturing the demand on Google because you got a bunch of returning customers that are searching and if you have a more competitive environment in in the search sphere then that's going to be impactful there. new customers is going to be a whole another set of actions related to okay on the new customer revenue side of things you're the majority of your revenue is being driven by meta likely and then you might have some app and Tik Tok or Google in there and so it's understanding what is the additional creative output and volume that we need in meta to be able to get to the goal additional spend volume and then outside of that are there additional channels we can expand into we're not running app 111 so let's get app 11ven going ahead of Q4 to drive net new c net net new customer revenue But that's all to say you identified a gap. Then the second step is identifying where that gap is coming from related to the customer cohort. Am I going after new or my returning customers in the specific time period that I'm after? And then from that, what are the specific actions that are going to lead to the impact on their new and returning customer cohort and on and on down the line. >> Okay. So part of I I want to jump back to kind of the beginning of your answer, Luke, which is where what you were pointing out is that the way that this becomes a little bit more complex or or rather a way that this question is phrased a little bit more with a little bit more nuance is that what it's talking about is identifying a problem before you actually go and fix it. Like you were saying before, a lot of time people are just like, hey, we need to just kind of like we want to do a little bit more in Q4. We want to outperform whatever that that might be. when in actuality what they need to do first is identify where there are meaning or like where the problems might be specifically and and how they'll need to back from. So Tony let's talk a little bit I'll throw it over to you to kind of comment I suppose on kind of how that happens and I mean Luke Luke already spoke to it but I'll I wanted to hear your perspective. [snorts] I'm just like having an emotional like visceral response to the language like a little bit more or as best as possible that that inherent in those sort of statements that lack of specificity is where all of the problems of the world exist as far as I can tell. So I think I think the caller's framing of the question like I I found it to be like when I when I heard the question I felt the thing I was like oh that that's a good starting point. I think the the thing that struck me in Luke's answer is he applied it to I think you applied it to the past sort of analyzing the past and I actually heard the caller's question in like the future the Q4 future planning but the same set of questions are relevant whether you're trying to diagnose something that's gone off track from your plan in the past you're trying to look forward into the future and it's practically [snorts] for all intents and purposes the exact same exercise. So if you were to work with CTC, you would have two data models that would support what what's likely going to happen with your business moving into Q4. You would have a spend and AMER model and then you would have a retention model. The combination of those two things will lead to the combination of those two things plus the planning process will lead to a likely financial outcome which then may represent a gap from whatever the organization is trying to do whether it's from the board or whatever the organization is trying to do. So, and then the question to to Luke's point earlier, the question becomes, okay, well, if we have these specific gaps at this point in time, then to use some more Luke language, what are the units of growth that we can apply to these specific gaps? And so, for us, it's there's lots of things you can do. It kind of boils down into some pretty simple things. marketing calendar moments creative and the other thought that occurred to me when this caller's question was spoken is potentially looking at some channel expansion. So let me give you four example. Let's say we have a revenue gap in forecasted for the Black Friday Cyber Monday period. Okay? And we have a certain amount of creative that we've already commissioned to produce. Well, one of the things that we're doing for our clients right now, right now at this moment in time, is we're exploring incrementality testing into into applov and into some channel expansion. What do we get to do with that? Well, we get the measurement right and then for in the situations where we we find this to be a channel that we believe can create the financial outcome that we need for a particular account, we don't need more new creative. we just get to deploy more media dollars against the creative that we already have. So, hypothetically, this madeup brand, let's say there's a $100,000 gap in the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period. We go and do some incrementality testing. We we get to a target for AppLin. Now, the unit of growth equals deploy 30, 40, maybe $50,000 into app in a net new channel during this period, aka gap close.

Try it yourself free for 7 days. Head to vermont.com/ctc or just click the first link in the description. >> All right. All right. Well, so I mean, is it as simple as that? Identify and then and then execute or is there like what what are I guess the things to watch out for with this? >> Well, [laughter] there there's having a plan, there's executing gets a plan. So, so the devil's in the devil's in the details and the execution for sure. So we it's very easy for us to go say well in this madeup particular scenario we have a plan to go deploy 50,000 incremental dollars into applov and we think this is going to be the return and we think that that that's going to create this financial outcome for us. So we can go do all those things and we may still need to adjust or pivot as a result of it. So yeah there's no there's no guarantee. >> Okay. Well, so I think it would be interesting then and I Luke maybe you'd be good to answer this, but like getting specific about obviously we don't know this caller specific situation, but specific about some of the ways that that execution happens. Um whether it's hey this is what happened when we deployed $40,000 in app loven or I don't know this is how we fill the hole in Google non-brand whatever the case may be. >> Yeah. So, this is kind of where I was going to go with it as well, which is identify and fill in a gap. It's sort of like we're we're talking about this language of this point in time that you identify the gap and then you look maybe historically you look in your future plan and then you sort of dissect from there. Okay, here's the actions we're going to take. How we do this actually is you do that every single day and that's how you fill the gap is the way to identify and then fill the gap is every single day identify and fill the gap based on a based on a specific what we're what we're talking about is a framework and structure for assessing that right you start at the top where's my contribution margin revenue ad spend me and then new and returning customers right and then down to the channel level right email meta Google so total business metrics new and returning customers and then channel level so that that framework and that that help us uncover where the gaps exist. But the the more from a from an executional lens how this actually comes to fruition is the way to identify and fill the gap is every single day identify and fill the gap that you're seeing in that point of time and it will change you. You create a plan today to go launch app and deploy $50,000 on it. three days from now the email campaign that you had planned is going to produce more or less revenue than you expected to because that's how a forecast works. So three days from now when you go and identify to fill that gap your returning customer revenue start to is going to start to be lagging behind and you are going to think have to think about an incremental campaign send or resend of that email just something along those lines to be able to fill that gap. And so I think the devil's in the details absolutely the the execution of these things using good media measurement framework to understand the true contribution of your channels. There's things that we could talk about in each of these lenses. But I think if there would be anything it would be have a clearly defined agreed upon framework for assessing how the business is performing against expectation, right? Like we talked about how we how we look at things. We set targets for each of these metrics. contribution margin down a new returning down to the channel level agreed upon framework for assessing the business impact. And then what you do is identify where you're off against that plan every single day and go and fill that gap. And you do that every single day. And that's how you identify and fill the gap consistently is have agreed upon framework, have persistence against executing against it every day. And the specific actions that are going to be the result of that sort of a processing cadence are going to change every day also. >> Interesting. So, so talk then so how do you balance say let's say that you do want to or you have identified that potentially upcoming there is this gap that would be filled by say putting 50 grand or something into app and obviously there's some sort of execution needed against that. Now obviously I understand talking about kind of the day-to-day execution but clearly there needs to be some sort of balance between actions that can be taken today in order for that app thing to come to fruition in a couple of months. So maybe pick apart a little bit more how that daily behavior is still allowing you to keep an eye out for what's happening in 4 to 6 weeks or whatever. I don't think they're separate things because the what that what that framework and daily behavior is going to highlight is where the gap actually exists for the business within that time frame and and the action of our new c our new customer revenue is behind let's say we believe we have a very high volume of creative output on meta and very high spin volume and we're going to continue to do that but we actually think we need to expand into other channels. So like all that let's just say we take for granted and because of that we're going to deploy app and media to affect our new customer revenue target. That's in the context of you're looking at the data every day. That's what surfaced. It may take a week to get app 11 live right get the creatives get the account set up the pixel rather than 24 hours to get it live. But you want to get app loven live as soon as you can get app loven live. it. There's no reason to say, "Hey, let's slate Appven for, you know, 40 days from now and let's work towards a 40-day launch timeline on Appven." Like, what what are we doing? You know, like you get Apploven to live tomorrow if you can get Apploven live because you're trying to solve for the new customer revenue gap that exists. Now there's just going to be a a necessity based on the resourcing constraints and any other dynamics that might exist of why app can't get live an hour from now and does actually need five business days or whatever whatever it might be. So those things are going to come but it shouldn't be this is the gap we're seeing for a business and then here's the things that we're slating purposely in the future to sort of cadence it. It's here's the gap we see here's all the things we need to do. how fast can we get those things live and and and then it's going to there's just going to be a necessary timeline against those things. But what's going to what what's going to dictate the timeline is is the resourcing necessary to complete those things rather than a strategic plan to launch it 30 days from now, right? Rather than a week from now. >> I see what you're saying. So it's like if there's a sense in which because the plan's already built and the plans and and that plan is good or you know however you want to define that if you just behave relative to these daily signals you will have eventually kind of executed the plan 30 to 60 months out. Even though let's say on a day-to-day basis you're really only thinking like one or two days in advance. At a certain point, if you're kind of like following what you need to follow and you're listening to these various signals, you're going to end up kind of doing what you said you were going to do without actually having to think about planning something out 30 to 60 days in advance or whatever. Is that does that sound right? >> Yeah, that that sounds that sounds right. What what I would just maybe add to clarify is if you've identified that this gap exists in your business against your forecast and this is the action that needs to result from it, then go and do that action as soon as you can. Now identifying the gap that exists, we we use this daily language which is like we have this rhythm of daily tracking against the outcome. But that doesn't mean that you're viewing the performance of your business in a 24-hour time frame. Okay? So I want I want to draw a distinction between these things where when you're tracking every day against the business forecast, it doesn't mean you're looking at last seven days only or even just yesterday's only data, right? Typically what we have in mind is a monthly time frame in terms of what we're executing against. In some cases, we'd go even broader than that. It can go out quarterly. But we we actually would say looking at yesterday's data only is not what you want to be looking at in assessing your in assessing the actions that you're taking. It can be used to inform it. But if you're if the main objective is a monthly hitting a monthly target, then you should be looking at the pacing of the business against that broader time horizon, right, in which you're assessing it. But do that every day and make sure the gap doesn't continue to grow in these areas against that monthly monthly target. So I think it's an important distinction just to say like we're looking at it every day, taking the actions and then as quickly as possible getting the actions into the workflow to be able to affect the problem. Yes, it's critical assessing the business performance on a 24-hour time window blocks individually not what we're advocating for. >> Right. So I I guess yeah one one thing to then kind of clarify that distinction is that the daily targets that you're talking about that you're working from are targets that are built or ladder up rather to monthly targets to yearly targets whatever. So, they are they already is what I guess I'm trying to say is that they exist within the context of an entire 12-month forecast or a month-to-month forecast, but because they're broken down into bite-sized chunks, so to speak, you have a much clearer sense of on a day-to-day basis what needs to be done today in order to reach those monthly those long-term targets. So, in that sense, the long term is broken into the short term and then the short term allows you to execute the long term a little bit more clearly. Let's go Tony. What what are your thoughts on this on this conversation? >> I'm trying to think of like a metaphor like like the metaphor of like the big picture sort of longer term planning cycle is like I want to lose weight >> or I want to [snorts] become healthier. Yeah. It's like the equivalent of saying like I want my business to grow. >> Yet the the way there is through the cumulative effect of daily actions, right? Today I go get some exercise and I go go do that again tomorrow. Did you guys lose me? My phone's ringing. >> No, still got you. >> So yeah, I think I think this this idea like it's easy to get lost in like the lofty like, oh, I have this big picture goal and what what I think CTC does really well in our thinking is put put shape and metric to the big picture goal. It's not I want to lose weight. is I want to lose 10 pounds in 10 months and then break that down into I need to do this every single day, >> right? >> And maybe if I just extend the metaphor a little bit further, let's see if I can come up with something on the spot. >> Well, okay. So, let's say I have it's the holidays, right? And I know that I want to lose 10 pounds by March of next year, but there's going to be some gaps created during Christmas and maybe some other holidays. Maybe I won't get to my exercise goal for that day or my calorie goal for that day. Well, what we can do ahead of time is we can account for some of that and try to daily plan our way around having a lower calorie week before Thanksgiving. I think this is like and the inverse of you know add in apploven at this point in time in the future because we see we foresee a revenue gap based on what our models are telling us and sort of strategically go into that space. But but back to Luke's point like if you have a new customer gap there's no reason to wait 30 or 45 days to go start trying to solve it by expanding your media into into a new channel. Makes sense. Yeah. No, I think that the the weight loss metaphor is a good one because it also like includes like you're saying like not predicting what am I anticipating seasonal changes, right? And saying like I expect that's what they never cut during the holidays, right? You know what I mean? Like you're going to be eating big on Thanksgiving and on Christmas. Therefore, you have to have some understanding what your like daily caloric budget is going to be in the days leading up or whatever. And so this is what we're talking about is like >> well you could you could cut during the holidays. You could eat 10,000 calories on Thanksgiving Day >> and still lose weight. No, you'd have to >> you'd have to be fasting. >> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] >> Several days before and after. >> Exactly. >> But that's the that's like the the magic of breaking down like a big picture like long-term strategy into into dayto-day practical. These are the thing this is the output that we need from today specifically. >> Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Well, do we we feel like we answered this question? We've gone for about 20 something minutes on it. Anything else we want to add, Luke, Tony? >> No, just just like the the caller's question like it really I think it got both of us going because it sort of started with the spirit of specificity which you're you're you're always going to get like a lot of excitement out of Luke and I if you talk in specific terms and over specific time horizons as well. That's right. All right. And and the only thing I'd add is I really like where we landed in answering the question with the question. The way you identify and fill the gap is every day you identify and fill the gap. >> That's Hold on. My dog's going off. >> Got the pup excited, too. Everyone loves loves a meadow response. >> All right. Well, I think what maybe what we can do here is take a quick slide into hot take corner before we go out. So, Tony Luke, what are your what are your hot takes of the week here? [snorts] >> I miss I miss basement. >> Interesting. >> I grew up in the Midwest and one of our co-workers was posting about his basement remodel and it's just not a thing they do in the in the South and in the West Coast. Like, apparently you can't dig in the ground here for whatever reason. So, basements are cool. >> Basements are cool. Agreed, Luke. [snorts] Maybe like our yards are the same thing here. I'm trying to think of what the parallel is. Garages are definitely part of it. But I but I won't say that because the Midwest, my my wife's side of the family in the Midwest, th those are some garages. you ever seen a garage? Hey, what I've been thinking about is having being able to flex being able to flex the resourcing and output of uh of your team and the resources that they oversee to be able to accomplish your revenue goals, I think is is something that not many organizations have built into their workflow. And what I mean by that is uh we have a person on our team or an agency or vendor that can support us and they can do 25 emails for us per month. But some months you need 29 to get to your revenue and some months you you need a 23 and you can shift some things around but because there's this fix fixed expectation there isn't variation and margin inside of that. The same could be said for your creative output and what's necessary in that time period. Same could be said for your the media channels you have. Well, we don't we don't really need app loving or Tik Tok because we'd probably only run it a couple months out of the year or pretty small spin. So, let's not so so let's just focus in these other areas. Having those as options in the arsenal that can be flexed on to be able to achieve the business goal. Finding a way to be able to make that a reality for the business, I think, is is not as not not as existing as it could be. >> Okay. I like it. So, we got we got there should be more basements and we've got we've got Luke's take on an actual e-commerce hot take on on basically figuring out staffing around these types of things. And then finally, I'll say that if I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be Brazilian steakhouse. I don't know how hot of a take that is actually, but that is a lot of meat to have for the rest of your life. But I do think it's good. That and the little cheese spreads. So, I think we'll leave it at that, folks. Now, real quick, for those of you who's joined us from the E-Commerce Playbook podcast, thanks for listening. Of course, you can subscribe to the DDC hotline separately. It's a separate feed. Listen to the pod and you'll get more answers like this. Now, if you want your questions answered, again, call and leave us a voicemail 866 DDC2263. You can shoot us a text there. Uh uh hit us up on X, hit us up on whatever, LinkedIn. If the internet still exists, hit us up on that. We'll see. [snorts] And but yeah, and then we might read our qu your question rather on a subsequent episode. So until next time for Tony the Chopper Chopped for Luke the weatherman Austin. I'm Richard the Professor Gaffin signing off. Hopefully not for the last time. Hopefully the AWS thing will resolve. But all right, we'll see you all next time. Take out.
