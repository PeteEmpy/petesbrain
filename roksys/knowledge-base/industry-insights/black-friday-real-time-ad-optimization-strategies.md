Hey folks, welcome to the E-Commerce Playbook Podcast. I'm your host, Richard Gaffin, director of digital product strategy here at Common Thread Collective, and I'm joined today by our VP of e-commerce strategy and sometime war reporter. He's out there on the front lines in the ecom trenches reporting for us. It's Mr. Luke Austin, also my co-host on the DDC hotline. Check it out. But Luke, what what's going on today, man? >> It's we're we're in November. It's official. And with that, I think the the early bird sales have some of them been launched. The others sort of in the in the midst of doing that and then Black Friday, Cyber Monday is right around the corner. So there's this there's this anxious anticipation that hangs in the air for all DTOC operators, marketers, and teams that we are very much in in the in in that state with with you all as well. But excitement, excitement to push forward the next few weeks and see what it has in store. >> That's right. Exactly. It is that time of year and that's what we're talking about today. Of course, what else is on anyone's mind? And and the thing that we're going to focus on today is around the concept of hourly tracking over Black Friday, Cyber Monday weekend. And what we're going to have Luke do is kind of make the case for why hourly tracking is so crucial in this obviously crucial time. But I should preface this by saying, you know, and after you L talks through this, it's going to make a little bit more sense here. But by the time you're hearing this, this is this is going to be the 4th of November. And for the following week until the 10th, we are offering a free Black Friday, Cyber Monday hourly tracking report that comes with the purchase of a profit system, which again to remind those of you who have forgotten, it's our spend and forecasting model. will model out 12 months of revenue for you, give you a sense of what daily targets should be across all of your different key platforms. But not only that, in in this upcoming week, we're also going to be offering this hourly BFCM tracking report. So, with that out of the way, let's actually jump into what this is and and I'll throw it over to you, Luke, to make the kind of pitch to us about why hourly tracking is so important. >> Yeah. So, I thought we'd do this through the lens of a couple examples of brands last year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, that we worked with to be able to execute on hitting hitting forecast and using the hourly targets to do that. So, we're I'm I'm going to pull up two specific brands that we'll walk through and we'll have the conversation through that lens of why it is crucial to not just have hourly targets in place for these big days, but then how do you actually operationalize against hourly targets? What what is it once you have the hourly targets? What does it enable you to do? Right? What is the behavior that it that that it helps to instill and create within your within your team? And so I think we'll start with we'll start with the first brand here. And each of these brands, the lens that we're looking at this with was each of these brands was had a high risk of missing either their Black Friday or Cyber Monday target. Brand one was pacing on Black Friday well behind what their revenue forecast was. And then brand two, Cyber Monday was was at risk based on the pacing for that day. And both of them because of the transparency of the hourly targets and what it allowed us to see, we're able to course correct really meaningfully to help bridge that gap. And so I think this will sort of come come to light and hopefully be helpful to folks in terms of how we think about operationalizing hourly targets in their workflow and to the the offer we're running right now. We want to be able to create the the forecast out through our profit system and hourly targets for as many brands as possible. So, it could be something that we partner with you in to be able to to be able to help make make reality. >> Cool. All right. Well, let's jump into it. So, you'd mentioned that the this first brand that we're going to look at here is a brand that would have missed their Black Friday target. They were pacing behind early in the day presumably and be but because we had an hourly hourly pacing build for them or rather an hourly tracking report, we were able to correct that before it was too late. So, let's jump into that right now. >> Yeah, that's that's exactly right. So this this first brand I'll and for those watching we'll have screen share pulled up for those listening along. We'll describe what we're talking through here. But for this first brand what we have up here is on Black Friday we landed minus1% to discounted sales target for the day and ad spin landed plus 16% to target. So from first glance this could be read as okay we hit the revenue target slightly under 1% whatever but we had to spend 16% more to get there from an efficiency standpoint from a profit standpoint uh that's not a great outcome. It might it might be the first read of this which this day in isolation um could be read as that. But we're I'm going to zoom out to what was happening in the days leading up to this because it's really important to frame the execution over Black Friday and where it landed. Before we talk through the specific examples though, I want to talk through hourly tracking and how we approach this in terms of the methodology and and the specifics of of these numbers. So, we're not going to talk through much of the forecasting process that goes into our profit system. We have many conversations and episodes around that of how we use the spending power model, the retention model, the event effect model, the marketing calendar, ad spend, incrementality and measurement to build out a P&L level forecast for every single month of the year and then break that down into daily targets that then have day of week effect overlaid with the marketing calendar to help get us to really high level of granularity in our daily targets which allows us to be really close to landing in forecast across our data set. for less than 2% on in in on either side of of missing forecast. So 98% or better to goal over the course of this year. As it relates to hourly targets though, we take that same process each of those steps. And once we have the daily targets, the main way that we're looking at hourly pacing is we are overlaying the target for this specific day against the hourly pacing of the year prior for that same day. Right? So we have a forecast set for this year and that is based on all the factors and the process that I mentioned which is going to be a target that's different than the the target for that same day of last year. It's going to be higher or lower than last year for that specific day. But then in terms of the hourly pacing we look at every single hour of the day the composition of that hour of revenue spend efficiency for each of the hours by day. And then we take the target for this year and we look at the overlay of that against the same pacing as last year because what it allows us to do is be able to see the the number we're after this year against a similar behavioral pacing of of last year. That's helpful for a number of reasons which we'll talk through here. But in terms of the visual we have up and what we'll be talking through, that's what we're looking at is we have the forecast set for this day of this year and then we're decomposing that on an hourly basis based on the last year's hourly pacing for that specific day to then see if we're pacing ahead or behind and which specific metric and be able to make the adjustments accordingly. So that's what we have in the hourly tracker here. We call it compare target to last year by hour. a target of this year by the hourly pacing of last year is a lens at which we're looking through this which which helps us to get a better understanding of our pacing throughout the day. Most ecom founders I know are drowning in spreadsheets waiting weeks just to figure out if they're actually profitable. Sound familiar? Here's what I tell them. Switch to Finaloop. It's the only accounting service built specifically for e-commerce and multi- channelannel brands. Instead of piecing together QuickBooks with a bookkeeper who really doesn't get cogs or inventory, Finloop's team handles everything and actually gets it. They sync directly with Shopify, Amazon, banks, ad accounts, and give you real-time P&L and cash flow that speak your language. Want to know if that new skew is making money? It's right there on the dashboard. Planning a raise or thinking exit? Your books are already investor ready. And honestly, it costs less than what you're paying your current bookkeeper for slow service level financials. I've seen too many founders tank their brand because they didn't know their numbers. Don't be one of them. Try Final Loop. You get 50% off for the first two months and you'll see the value from day one. Links in the show notes. Yeah. And just to clarify for those who are listening, the the kind of top chart that we're seeing here, if I'm understanding this correctly, is so what you have is basically Black Friday is Black Friday of 2024 here is pulled up and and broken down by performance by hour. And then there's a chart above it that shows the sort of hourly performance overlaid against 2023's Black Friday performance, I would presume. Right. And what you can see is that there's a very strong correlation between those two lines. I mean, there's there's some discrepancies here and there, but overall the sort of these two lines, what actually happened on 2024 and then what happened in 2023 in terms of the buying behavior over the course of the day follows roughly the same curve. which just goes to sort of reinforce that idea that looking at last year's behavior is super beneficial for thinking about what hourly pacing should look like. >> Yes, that that's exactly right. And there's so there's two there's two important things for us to chat about as it relates to this this approach which is I think it's clear to most of us that if your marketing calendar your promo schedule your email send cadence if that's similar to the year prior then this approach should yield very similar correlation in terms of your hourly tracking right like you should expect we're running the same business very similar consumer consumer customer subset or potential customer subset and the behavior associated with them and we have a similar offer going out and email sync cadence etc. Our hourly pacing should look really similar. So this approach makes a lot of sense, right? Like and for many brands that that that would be the case. And then the the second response to this might be, well, how does this help us if we're doing things different this year, right? So we're looking at the hourly pacing relative to last year's hourly pacing. That makes sense if all things are held consistent, but how how does this help us if we are doing something different than we did last year? And the answer to that question is it helps you to see how you're doing compared to last year. It it helps you to know if the things that you have changed in your marketing calendar, your email cadence, etc. If those are in improving or not improving relative to what you did the year prior and not just improve, yes, worse, yes, but like what is the what is the magnitude to what the impact of these things, right? So helps us understand how are we doing relative to the activities we did the year prior and then what's this what how do how are we quantifying that as well to what what extent are those are those changing and so I think it's important that we all understand that having a frame a frame of reference in order to assess the performance and the impact of these decisions is is is really important and and this this brand that we're looking at I think is a good example of that. So, as I mentioned on Black Friday, we landed minus 1% to discounted sales target and and we landed 16% ahead of ad spend, right? So, we had to spend more to get to right at our forecast goal for that day. But what's important is we're going to zoom out here to the day prior to Thursday. Um, and on Thursday, this brand does a VIP early access launch like many of us do to its existing customer set through email and SMS channels. It's a really high percentage returning revenue day and and then the sale goes live early access couple a couple hours later. But Thursday is the first day of the sale towards the back half of the day. And what we have pulled up here on the hourly tracker is that Thursday landed 65% ahead of sales target. and we landed 20% ahead of of of spend. So, Thursday meaningfully outperformed what the expectation was by 65%. In this case, that's a little over $100,000 relative to what the expectation was. And then we were able to spend more volume than we expected as well based on that pacing. So, 20 20% ahead. And the reason for this is you what we can see in the hourly pacing here is last year this sale launched at at 400 pm Pacific. And so that's the first sort of hourly spike we see in terms of their revenue pacing is 400 p.m. Pac Pacific spike and then an SMS was sent out 2 hours later. So it was early access email then wait two hours then the SMS that went out local time for the remaining you know subsequent few hours of the day. And so you sort of see like two spikes happening through the course of that day as those communications were sent at different times and the cadence was and the cadence was different. This year or sorry 2024 what we did right so last year relative to the year prior we went out at an earlier time. We actually did an early access VIP through SMS prior and did that 2:00 p.m. so 2 hours earlier in the day. And then we did the full sort of maximum list available on email email blast 2 hours later and then that did local send time throughout the tapered off throughout the rest of the day. Um and so what you can see in the hourly pacing is we started ramping up revenue earlier than we did the year prior, right? because we did the the SMS send earlier and then we did the email send and it started to taper off through the day and that led us to beating the revenue target substantially. What this allowed us to do again I think through the lens of the the this year prior was very different in terms of the marketing calendar cadence than the than the year before. And so what was helpful in this case is to understand what the impact of that different set of activities was. Right? We had a hypothesis around sending the SMS first, sending out earlier, doing the email send in this cadence, but we need to quantify what the actual impact was. And in this case, it led to a revenue day that was 65% higher than the year before as it allowed us to to drive that volume through the day. And then the subsequent action that that led us to be able to engage in is increasing the ad spend investment over the course of that day. So we've toggled in the chart here from looking at the sales by hour to the spend by hour. we were able to ramp up ad spend earlier in the day because the the offer went out earlier which allowed us to drive more volume as well and then we kept sort of the same hourly pacing for the remainder of the day. So we got like an extra 2 hours of spend ramp up which for a shorter day like this when we're doing an afternoon VIP early access launch was was really valuable as well. So, Thursday, the day prior, meaningfully beat the revenue expectation that allowed us to spend 20% more than we had planned for that day. But at the end of all of this, we actually underspent the opportunity on Thursday. We we left volume on the table relative to what was available to us by only spending 20% more against 65% higher revenue target. Our new revenue landed 26% ahead of goal. So, we had more room to be able to push ad spin volume over the course of this day because it was even stronger than we anticipated it would be. >> Yeah. Okay. So, then let's talk about how that affected like what happened on Black Friday of >> 204. Exactly. So, this was the outcome of Thursday and so we go into Friday looking at okay, we we beat expectation meaningfully. This was a the adjustments to the VIP launch on Thursday were even more impactful than we thought. We were able to push more volume, but we left volume on the table. So when you look at Friday in isolation again we landed minus 1% to revenue goal for the day but spin landed 16% ahead. So what we have on the chart here is we can see our revenue pacing over the course of of the day was was pretty strong relative to the year prior. But when we toggle over to ad spend, what we ended up doing on Friday is spending much more aggressively the first half of the day and into the early afternoon relative to what the pacing was the year prior. And so we have the hourly spend target breakdown chart here up. And what you can see is our hourly pacing up to about the 4:00 a.m. hour was was really commiserate with the year prior. But then the subsequent like six hours, seven hours, we outspent each of the hour pacing. We kept a higher ad spend over the course of those hours. And in the evening, it sort of tapered off and kept more consistent with with the remainder of the day. Now, why did we do this? The main reason was because we left volume on the table on Thursday, right? we under spent. We actually realized too much of the profit expectation relative to um the revenue on that day which allowed us to have the dollars available on Friday to be able to spend more to make sure we arrived at the revenue target and didn't leave that on the table relative to Thursday. And so you can see the sort of like net impact of this is if we look at Thursday and Friday in aggregate which we have pulled up here, we landed 14% ahead of revenue target for those days on aggregate and 16% ahead of spend target. So really dang close to the expectation of total ad spin ad spend volume against the revenue expectation for those two days in aggregate. But that came after Thursday being a much more meaningfully meaningful beat and us leaving volume on the table and then us taking those additional dollars and deploying them on Friday over spinning against the expectation to make sure the aggregate landed at the expected goal. if we didn't have the transparency into how much of an impact those different actions on Thursday made and then what the hourly pacing was relative to the target and then Friday we had just allowed to spend to goal right like allowed it to spend 0% to forecast like write a goal instead of spending 16% to forecast our revenue would have landed 10 12% behind for black Friday right we would have just left the continue to leave the volume on the table and the total for those days would have been below expect expectation relative to the revenue outcome. >> Yeah. Okay. So to clarify then the our ability to track hour by hour at least on Thursday revealed to us the fact that there was an opportunity here that we were potentially missing if we had just sort of continued business as usual. So because we had that insight, we were able to on Friday then make some pretty make some pretty major adjustments to the way that we were approaching Black Friday in order to realize, you know, the the potential revenue, right? So talk to me about like how how the actual like hour like understanding of hourby- hour performance on Friday impact decision making. >> Yeah. So on on Friday, we'll pull back up the hourly hourly pacing here. What we can see is that starting about the 4:00 a.m. hour, the 4,5 and 6 a.m. hour, our revenue outpaced the expectation relative to what the hourly targets were. So, we we were doing we were doing better the 4, 5, and 6 a.m. hours um relative to where we thought we would be, but then what we started to see is the 7 8 a.m. hours tapered off and started to hit the same level as the year prior. And then you can see the 9 and 10 hours then started to be below the hourly pacing prior, right? So like the morning hours like oh we're we're we're actually potentially pacing ahead here. Then it starts to get back plateaus back to the pacing last year. Okay, this is commisser and then it starts to dip down and the indication there would be okay we might we may have pulled some of the more more of the revenue forward right by doing the earlier launch and the email SMS communication. And so these hours are going to be softer. And so we started to see the softness of the revenue during those sort of midm morning hours there in terms of the revenue. And so you have a decision to make at that point, right? Okay, we lean in the morning. We saw a strong outcome. We're starting to see slower revenue pacing over the course of these hours. What should we do as a result? Should we pull back our ad spend pacing commiserate with that? Right? like the 10 a.m. hour landed 22% behind the revenue goal based on the hourly targets for the 10 a.m. hour on Black Friday. So, do we start to pull back our ad spend that the the day in aggregate or the remaining hours of the day we pace, you know, 10 15% lower than the than the hourly expectations? Do we hold things consistent hoping that our revenue is going to pick up or do we actually double down and and try to make up some of the revenue some of the revenue gap? So that's what the hourly the hourly targets in this case surface that that specifically in terms of here's here's what here's the decision that we have to make relative to the ad spend that we're going to be allocating over the re the remainder of the day. Now the context of Thursday if we had on Thursday let's say landed 20% ahead of revenue target and 20% ahead of spend right so we had we had sort of matched up to the revenue expectation then the decision the decision on Friday at that 10 a.m. hour again likely would have been let's keep our spend consistent with the daily targets. Let's not overindex. Let's not pull back too soon, right? Because we know the set cyber Monday evening revenue peak, but let's keep things consistent because Thursday we sort of like spent right up to the goal of where the revenue landed. Friday, we're like right right in the mix there. So, we don't want to overextend. We don't want to pull back too aggressively. That wasn't the case, though, because Thursday was 68% ahead of the the revenue target. So we had we had understand that what we what we could have over the course of that day. And so then the conversation on Friday becomes okay this is where we're at. We're seeing softness in some of these revenue hours. We have a lot of additional revenue banked from Thursday relative to the expectation and we know later this day we're going to see that increase. And so what we're going to do is actually double down on the ad spend over the over the remaining hours. And so what I switched to here for those listening along is the hourly pacing of ad spend over those remaining hours. And you can see at 10 at those 9 10 a.m. hours when the revenue started to soften, our ad spend actually started to pick up. We started to push more ad spend volume over the course of those hours to help sort of push against that curve over the remainder of the day so that we made sure to stay at the revenue expectation. And that's what we continue to track over the remainder of the day is how our revenue is pacing against target. and it was slower for a few of those hours and then as a result of us leaning more into the ad spend right over these hours the evening hours picked up and and ended up pacing in line with what the re revenue expectation was because we we didn't let off the gas in a similar way. So the context of where we landed Thursday, beating the expectation actually under under spending by some extent that and then on Friday being able to see how the revenue pacing by hour where that was landing then allowed us to make make the decision to let's actually increase our ad spend volume against it to make sure that Friday lands really close to the goal. >> Okay. So let's let's then jump into our next example unless there's something else you want to hit here. And so for context and this is a this is on Cyber Monday and it's a similar kind of situation where >> there was a sense in which like if we had continued business as usual that it would have missed a crucial target on Cyber Monday but because of our hourly pacing we were able to understand how we would need to adjust to get to where we needed to go. So let's let's jump into the second brand here. >> Yeah. So this is a similar sort of example but on a very different day of Cyber Monday where the hourly pacing on Cyber Monday your evening hours are going to be the strongest. On Black Friday typically it's going to start tailing off those evening hours after the first half of the day into the early early afternoon. So each of the each of these days the shape of revenue is really really important to to understand. But what we can see here is starting pretty early on in the day, the 7:00 a.m. hour on forward, really through noon, really through midday, revenue was underpacing the expectation meaningfully. Some of some of these hours some of these hours were missing expectation by by 40% 30% to to goal for for a number of subsequent hours there which you play that out and Cyber Monday lands 30 40% behind forecast right well where Cyber Monday actually landed for this business was minus 15% behind forecast in terms of the the revenue outcome we won't have time to sort of like put that in the context of where the other days were leading up to it but it's safe to say This day was pacing to being really far off the target. And although it landed lower than forecast, it was it was a much much better outcome that it was on pace to be over the course of those initial few hours that were that were pacing meaningfully off target. And so when we see the the revenue pacing by hour for those early hours of the day, we can look at the ad spend target by hour and what we see is a similar story which is we're under spending the expectation meaningfully, right? And the the year prior, what we can see in the hourly targets is the ad spend continued to climb up really through like the 9:00 a.m. hour, like 6 7 8 9:00 a.m. just continued to stack higher ad spend and then it sort of hit a plateau and then increased into the evening hours for the rest of the day. Well, for this day, we were underspending those morning hours pretty substantially and we weren't really building up building them up the same way the year prior had. And so that it's a pretty clear story to say here our revenue is pacing meaningfully behind target. Our ad spend pacing meaningfully behind target. We we need to make some substantial changes or we're going to land 30 40% behind the expectation for for this day out of the weekend. And so that's what you can see is starting around the noon the noon hour spend starts to increase more and then builds up 1 2 3 4 p.m. PST. And each of those hours outpaced the spend of the prior year really substantially. And if we sort of cross that with what the revenue looked like is starting around the noon 1 hour is when we started to comp to the revenue by hour of the year prior. And the the 2 p.m. PST actually beat the year prior after again those morning hours were pacing meaningfully off. And then the evening hours paced a lot a lot closer to the expectation for the day prior. And in this case, I think it's the the important thing to illustrate is how aggressive these early afternoon hours were in terms of the ad spend. They were substantially higher than the original target for those days. And that was a result of one having transparency to how much the morning hours were pacing behind. And so knowing how much we had to the specific amount of ad spend we had to go and make up plus understanding the evening hours are the biggest on Cyber Monday. And so we really need to get ramp up that volume prior to those evening hours to give us a chance at comping at those levels which is what we ended up we ended up doing to bridge the gap from earlier in the day. So again like the clear lesson here being that let's say that we didn't have sort of hourly transparency into what was happening on Cyber Monday like you're saying that line that where you can see it being 40% below the previous year's performance that kind of gap would have just persisted throughout the day and they would have ended up meeting completely behind. So, so essentially like what happened then is is like you saw that in order to replicate the success or replicate the performance of the previous year or even beat it, there would have to be some sort of meaningful injection of ad spend over and against what you were originally planning to do. Is that correct? like you had originally been planning to spend a lot less during that hour, but because we had some understanding of the way that the forecast or the plan would need to be broken in order to get the result that we wanted, we were able to meaningfully overspend where we had thought we were going to be at that hour or something along those lines. Yeah. >> Yeah. That that's exactly right. And I think it sort of goes back to framing of like okay what's what's the impact of having the hourly targets especially in relation to the breakdown by hour compared compared to the year prior is like one we can see where we're ahead or behind pace that's that's the easier thing to get at get at but quantifying the extent to which we're at or we're above or behind pace for each of these metrics sales spend new customer revenue Facebook spend Facebook rise Google spend google so quantifying the exact amount that we're behind. And then knowing what that means to the rest of the day to be able to stay on on track is is the most important thing. Okay, we're pacing behind the hour. Are we pacing are we pacing behind, you know, $2,000 in spend for each of these hours or $20,000 in spend? What does that mean in terms of how aggressive our actions need to be in the afternoon to give us a shot at being able to comp in in this specific example? So, yeah, highlighting for every single metric, every single hour, are we ahead or behind? and then specifically by how much. That that's what helps to inform the decisions around how we're going to adjust to make sure that trend doesn't persist or that it improves. >> Right. All right. Anything else that you want to hit hit on these, Luke? >> I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so. Don't know what we do with without hourly trackers and we want to build some for you all. So, let us know if you're interested. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, if Yeah. If you do want us to build a free Black Friday, Cyber Monday hourly track and report with the purchase of a profit system, that's going on right now. That offer is going on right now for the next week or so. And this is, by the way, open to, unlike some of our other things, this is open to seven figure brands as well. So, if you're anywhere from seven to nine figures, this is absolutely going to change the way that you approach Black Friday, Cyber Monday. So, obviously, I highly recommend it. I think one thing that worth pointing out too is that like the the hourly shape of Black Friday and Cyber Monday is very specific in a way that like the hourly sort of customer behavior is not on other days. So there's like because there's such like clear hourly changes, it's really really important to understand how you're performing relative to those on an hourly basis as opposed to a daily basis. So anyway, if that's something that you want and I think you do, you know where to find us. como.com. Hit that hire us button. Let us know that you're interested. We would love to chat. All right, I think that's going to do it for us for Luke the weatherman Austin, which is of course his name on DODC Hotline or other podcast. Great talking to you all and we [music] will see you all next time. Bye. [music]
