impact. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration see on average +18%  
increase in unique search query categories with conversions and +19%  
increase in conversions.



INDUSTRY NEWS

   Challenger brands are winning UK shoppers

   Challenger brands are attracting UK consumers, including young families  
and high-income households, by gamifying the retail experience. While  
competitive pricing is the initial draw, the real driver of repeat  
purchases is the emotional payoff they engineer. Legacy retailers can  
counter by creating the same excitement, focusing on lifetime value, and  
leveraging physical stores for seamless, rewarding omnichannel journeys.

   New control for Ads on Google Search

   We've introduced an update to make Search better for everyone. Now, all  
text ads on Google Search are grouped under ‘Sponsored results', which  
stays visible as you scroll, making it easier to distinguish ads from  
organic results. To improve user navigation, a ‘Hide sponsored result'  
control allows users to collapse all text ads with a single click. The  
‘Sponsored' label is also being rolled out to other units, like Shopping  
ads.
