## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: AI's impact on workforce and job displacement
**Reason**: While this addresses AI's broader business impact including potential effects on marketing departments, it focuses primarily on job cuts rather than specific AI marketing tools, strategies, or automation practices. It provides contextual awareness for AI adoption but lacks actionable marketing insights.
