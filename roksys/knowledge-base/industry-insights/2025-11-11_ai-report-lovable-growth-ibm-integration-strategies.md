## Boost the impact of your agentic AI

Leaders today face critical challenges when going from AI ambition to practical implementation.

One of the biggest obstacles is integration. While integration is critical to unlocking AI’s value, CIOs may not feel fully prepared to manage and integrate AI technology into their existing business. 

This can lead to AI agents and assistants operating in silos, which can be a barrier to progress. 

Explore IBM’s playbook detailing 3 challenges and approaches you can take to help boost the impact of your agentic AI.

## 💡 Lovable hits 8M user milestone

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Stockholm-based AI coding startup **Lovable** **is approaching 8M users**, up from 2.3B in July, CEO Anton Osika confirmed at Web Summit in Lisbon. The company, founded one year ago, sees 100,000 products built daily and **has raised $228M to date, including a $200M Series A that valued it at $1.8B.**

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* **Lovable’s user base has tripled in four months**, with more than half of Fortune 500 companies using the platform to accelerate internal software creation and prototyping.

* The company reached **$100M in annual recurring revenue** in June, though Osika declined to share updated figures amid questions about whether the “vibe coding” trend is cooling.

* Despite a 40% inflow dip reported by Barclays analysts in September, **retention remains above 100%**, and the company has surpassed 100 employees, adding leadership from San Francisco.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

Lovable’s surge shows** how low-code AI tools are reshaping software creation**, letting non-developers build apps at enterprise scale. For business leaders, this signals faster product cycles and lower development fees, but also **a need to track sustainability** as hype-driven adoption stabilizes.

## How AI cut disputes and sped up cash flow

* Danone **struggled with inefficiencies in HR and operations**, with manual data entry causing billing errors and delayed payments.

* The company deployed **Microsoft 365 Copilot and autonomous agents** to automate validation, detect discrepancies, and prefill HR and order data accurately.

* Results included **faster order handling, fewer billing disputes, and improved inflows**. Employees gained time to focus on innovation and higher-value work.
