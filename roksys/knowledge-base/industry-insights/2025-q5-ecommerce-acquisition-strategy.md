# Welcome to Q5: The Most Important Quarter You're Ignoring

**Source**: Common Thread Collective (YouTube Podcast)

## Summary

Common Thread Collective's podcast episode featuring Dean Brennan (CEO of Heart & Soil) and Dave Huffman (Co-Founder of Fifth Hammer) breaks down why Q5—the six-week period from late December through January—is the most critical acquisition window for health, wellness, beauty, and subscription e-commerce brands.

**Key premise**: After holiday shipping cutoffs, the calendar flips into Q5, a period characterised by:
- **Identity change moments** (New Year's resolutions - 79% related to health)
- **CPM price collapse** (bottoms out December 23rd, lowest prices all year)
- **Highest intent customers** (January cohorts outperform all other months in LTV)
- **Highest volume opportunity** (most new customers acquired in this period)

The episode contrasts two approaches:
1. **Community-led challenges** (Heart & Soil) - High engagement, 8.2% higher customer value
2. **Frictionless acquisition** (Fifth Hammer) - Volume focus, "acquire and harvest" model

Both agree: Q5 is the Super Bowl for customer acquisition, not Q4.

## Key Takeaways

### Strategic Insights

1. **Q5 > Q4 for many brands** - The holiday shipping cutoff doesn't end the year; it starts the most important acquisition window

2. **CPM arbitrage window** - December 23rd marks the absolute bottom of advertising prices, which gradually increase through the entire year until the next Black Friday/Cyber Monday

3. **Identity change = purchase intent** - January is culturally ingrained as permission to change identity, similar to major life events (divorce, home purchase) that drive behavioural shifts

4. **January cohorts outperform** - Higher LTV, more purchases throughout the year, better retention (even accounting for longer purchase window)

5. **Law of Double Jeopardy** - More customers = more loyal customers (because the 20-30% heavy buyer ratio holds, so more volume = more heavy buyers in absolute numbers)

6. **Most growth comes from light buyers** - 70-80% of customers purchase 1-2 times ever; Coca-Cola's average buyer frequency is only 12 times/year

7. **Early momentum lowers future friction** - Hitting January/February goals sets the tone for the entire year

### Tactical Approaches

**Heart & Soil (Community Model)**:
- 30-day challenge (Animal-Based 30 Challenge)
- Circle community platform (50,000+ members)
- Kickoff calls, self-paced courses, cohort-based engagement
- 8.2% higher customer value at 12 months
- January cohort pattern: Strong start → dip in months 2-3 → returns month 4-5 → outperforms by 12% at month 12
- **Tradeoff**: Higher LTV, lower volume (high friction to enter)

**Fifth Hammer (Frictionless Model)**:
- "Acquire and harvest" strategy
- Small pack sizes (lower price point, less friction)
- Volume over efficiency in January
- Scale into 60-day LTV or even 1-year LTV during Q5
- Harvest throughout year with additional promos (February/March for second purchase)
- **Philosophy**: "I don't care" about light buyers leaving - focus on penetrating total addressable market

### Volume vs. Efficiency Trade-Off

**Dave Huffman's position (Volume)**:
- Go all-in on volume in January
- Scale into 60-day or 1-year LTV (acceptable during this window only)
- "January sets the tone for the year" (Law of January)
- More January customers = bigger harvest in Q4 to offset media degradation
- By April, if you've exceeded forecast 4 months in a row, you can miss Q3 and still hit year goals

**Dean Brennan's consideration**:
- Previous year chose efficiency (cash flow preservation for inventory build)
- Now questioning if missed opportunity (could have acquired "unbelievable" volume)
- January cohort has 10% more orders over the year vs. any other cohort
- Leaning toward volume for 2026

### Channel & Tactics

**Partnerships**:
- Performance PR on CPA basis
- Performance TV (CPA-negotiated)
- Healthcare practitioner channels (white coat syndrome = credibility)
- Influencer partnerships
- Cross-brand promotions during challenges

**Organic Content**:
- Founder-led content performs significantly better in January (algorithm boost for health content)
- Educational debates (e.g., Paul Saladino vs. Brian Johnson on diet approaches)

### Offer Design

**Retention-focused offers** (Heart & Soil):
- Avoid deep Black Friday-style discounting for health brands
- Focus on transformation and behavioural components
- Store credit instead of discounts (different psychology)
- Offer at program start + completion incentive

**Low-friction entry** (Fifth Hammer):
- Smaller pack sizes (18-count vs. 30-count) = faster reorder cycle
- Lower price points (still good margin)
- 60-day money-back guarantees
- Not afraid of extreme discounts if margins hold

### Data Points

- **Heart & Soil January cohort**: 8.2% higher customer value, 10% higher purchase frequency
- **Buyer frequency across industry**: 2-3 purchases/year average (driven down by light buyers)
- **Coca-Cola buyer frequency**: 12 times/year (50%+ buy only 1-2 times ever)
- **Heavy buyer ratio**: 20-40% of customers (3+ purchases ever), holds consistently across brands
- **New Year's resolutions**: 79% health-related; 8% still active after 30-60 days
- **CPM bottom**: December 23rd consistently year-over-year

## Relevance to Business

**High relevance (8/10)** - Directly applicable to e-commerce client strategy:

1. **Budget allocation timing** - Clients in health/wellness/beauty/supplements should shift thinking from Q4 as peak to Q5 as the critical window

2. **ROAS expectations** - CPM arbitrage in January means better efficiency; set targets accordingly and communicate to clients why January performance looks different

3. **Cohort analysis** - When analysing client performance, track January cohorts separately; use 12-month LTV data to justify volume over efficiency trade-offs

4. **Offer strategy consultation** - Help clients decide between:
   - Community/challenge model (higher LTV, lower volume, better for established brands with product-market fit)
   - Frictionless acquisition (higher volume, acceptable for scaling or proving TAM)

5. **Budget pacing advice** - "Law of January" and "Riley Law of November" frameworks useful for forecasting and momentum management

6. **Client retention storytelling** - If client hits January/February hard and succeeds, positions agency well for rest of year (momentum = confidence)

7. **Multi-brand clients** - Fifth Hammer's portfolio approach (acquire heavily in January, harvest throughout year) applicable to clients with multiple product lines

**Not directly applicable**:
- Specific to subscription/repeat purchase businesses (less relevant for high-ticket, one-time purchase clients)
- US market focus (cultural New Year's resolution pattern may vary by market)
