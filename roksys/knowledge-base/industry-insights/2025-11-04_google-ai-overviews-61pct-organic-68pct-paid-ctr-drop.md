## Summary

- Google AI Overviews are causing dramatic CTR declines: 61% drop in organic and 68% drop in paid search click-through rates
- Even when AI Overviews don't appear on SERPs, overall user clicking behavior has fundamentally changed with CTRs hitting historic lows
- This represents a major shift in search behavior that impacts all Google Ads campaign performance metrics and expectations
- The data suggests users are finding answers directly in AI Overviews without needing to click through to websites
- Advertisers need to fundamentally reassess bid strategies, budget allocation, and performance benchmarks in light of these changes

## Key Insights

- The 68% decline in paid CTR is unprecedented and signals a fundamental shift in how users interact with search results, not just a temporary adjustment period
- The fact that CTRs are declining even when AI Overviews don't appear suggests broader behavioral changes in how users approach search, potentially doing more research before clicking
- Campaign performance benchmarks from pre-AI Overview era are no longer valid; advertisers must establish new baseline expectations
- This CTR decline will disproportionately impact top-of-funnel and informational queries where AI Overviews are most likely to provide direct answers
- Budget efficiency may actually improve if the remaining clicks are more qualified, but total volume expectations must be significantly reduced
