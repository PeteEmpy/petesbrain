## Transcript

We're actually starting to think more and more about January and how our industry e-commerce can get sort of lumped into these like patterns where everybody's on the same rhythms. But the reality is for a lot of businesses, the most important time of year starts right freaking now. And this idea of Q5 and as Dean, you even talked about it, people begin to consider changing their identity. I like that phrase. Like always a great impetus for purchase. You know, I've seen a lot of the data of like people's shopping behavioral patterns change a lot when they get divorced or they buy a new home. These major pivots lead to identity change as an impetus for purchase. And that's part of what makes January so powerful. This episode of the e-commerce playbook is brought to you by Tax Cloud. It's peak season for e-commerce. Your team's moving fast, orders are flying in, and every day feels like a sprint to the finish line. But as sales climb, your sales tax obligations are probably getting more complicated, too. That's where Taxcloud comes in. They're the trusted sales tax filing partner for Shopify brands, handling registrations, filings, and compliance directly with the state so you don't have to. With everything else you're juggling this season, sales tax shouldn't be one of them. Taxcloud has you covered. Start at taxcloud.com/thread. Welcome back to another episode of the e-commerce playbook podcast. We're sitting here, it's about 24 hours till the Christmas season. shopping, shipping cutoff is upon us. And so that means it's over, right? That means that there's nothing left to sell and we can all just go and rest and enjoy the festivities. But oh no is that's not true. In fact, what the calendar just does is flip to Q5, baby. So today I brought in the two greatest supplement sellers I've ever met in the history of my life and we're going to jam on all things Q5. Let's dive in. Joining me today, I've got Dean Brennan, CEO of Heart and Soil, and Dave Huffman, CEO of the Fifth Hammer and 1,000 supplement brands filling your Instagram feeds. And we're here today to talk all about the Super Bowl of health and wellness that is Q5. and we're going to talk about that. But first, let's get an intro from these gents. Dean, I'll go to you. Who are you and what are is the health and well-being that you're selling me? >> All right. Appreciate you having me on again. Dean Brennan, been on the pod before and you might notice I have uh a little bit of a different haircut here. Shaved the hair off about four weeks ago. We don't need to go into that. Anyways, yeah, I've been with Heart and Soil Supplements since the beginning 2020. The supplements we sell, they're beef organs. They happen. In my opinion, they're a tool. We really sell what I call radical health, which is going to be a fun conversation about Q5 because that's when people's identity transforms or they wish it to. So, it's a really good moment for us. >> Dino, I was going to say you're going to challenge Taylor for the top spot of Madonna of e-commerce, >> but Taylor hasn't changed. I know. I need to I need to I need to I was just thinking about that the other day, Dave. I'm really getting boring. I think you got to get like a handle like a handlebar mustache next. Like I think that'll be good. >> Yes, I'll go next, I guess. Huh? Dave Huffman. I'm the I'm a partner and co-founder in a group called Fifth Hammer. We we think of ourselves sort of as an accelerator studio for consumer health supplement brands, but I've been in the space since about 2015. I've worked with dozens of of health and wellness brands across the space, even into personal development. So Q5 is something that, you know, I have thought was cliche in certain moments because it feels overused, but it's has maintained its impact over the years. So we lean into it pretty heavily across our entire portfolio. We we specifically work with founders to help them achieve their ultimate outcome, but that's also just to make greater impact. And so that's why we lean into the space. We've seen a lot of people genuinely change their lives with supplements. and this journey that people go on from hope and health and you know that's why that's why we do what we do. So, the reason this is such an important episode, we had a sort of a client webinar pre- Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and I got on and I I was struck and reminded by a bunch of people telling me, "Yeah, yeah, like Black Friday is super important, but we're not really a gifting business. We're actually starting to think more and more about January and how our industry, e-commerce, can get sort of lumped into these like patterns where everybody's on the same rhythms." But the reality is for a lot of businesses, the most important time of year starts right freaking now. And this idea of Q5 and as Dean, you even talked about it, people begin to consider changing their identity. I like that phrase. That's like always a great impetus for purchase. You know, I've seen a lot of the data of like people's shopping behavioral patterns change a lot when they get divorced or they buy a new home. These major pivots lead to identity change as an impetus for purchase. And that's part of what makes January so powerful. But on top of that, one of the other major reasons I was just looking at a graph and Cory, let's throw this up on the screen. It is our tracking of meta CPMs that throughout the year for the last two years and we are about to experience what is a consistent regular pattern every single year that the absolute bottom of the advertising pricing market begins about December 23rd and then it just scales up the entire year. So you have this pattern of that's cyclical every year where you have a bottoming out of ad inventory on December 23rd and then the price of ads go up all the way through Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas through the end of the year. That's functionally how the CPM pricing market works. And so for brands we we and this this applies to supplements, health and wellness also to beauty. We experienced that at Bamboo Earth January in this period of time where your conversion rate remains higher and CPMs are depressed because for a lot of brands they remove spend down represent the biggest opportunity to acquire business new customers and grow your business all year. So today I'm going to have these gentlemen talk a little bit about how they each approach it. I think they take slightly different approaches each of them. Dean and co have been running a very specific program for multiple years where they invite all their customers into a challenge and Dave as he likes to describe himself goes much more Tim Duncan turnaround jumper off the backboard. So you're going to hear about both today. But if you are in the space where these next six weeks are your Super Bowl, stick around cuz this is going to be everything. So Dean, I'm going to come to you first. Tell me what how Heart and Soil approaches this moment and give us some data about how it relates to the rest of the year in terms of impact for your business. Yeah, I love it. So, it's an interesting time period because if if we scale back and just think about like why people buy in the first place and then why people stick with a product, you always hear marketers talk about identity, right? Appeal to their identity. And U5 is a moment in which at least I can't think of any other moment over the course of every single year where it's it it's kind of strange actually. is just ingrained in the entire culture that we give ourselves permission to change our identity. We give ourselves proactive permission to change our identity. And why that is really really important in the terms of health is you know usually people don't change a habit or do something like how many people listening to this were like oh I'm going to I'm going to do this new new program starting next week or today because I don't want to wait until the new year. Most people don't do that, right? Like the reason why and Dave can actually talk a lot about this because I think this is his area of expertise from a psychological component or behavior change component. People don't change unless they have something that happens to them, right? They get diagnosed with diabetes. They I don't know their wife says, "Hey, you're really unhealthy and I can't deal with this anymore." there there has to be something where the pain is greater than the actual >> like a rough >> yes than that >> 100%. So that's usually how it is and so given you have this moment come January where everybody almost everybody I think like 79% of resolutions are related to health. People are proactively saying I give myself permission to be a new human. I'm going to be the walker that eats healthy in the morning. Right? And so you have this identity shift that happens at just a mass scale. And so how we approach it is like okay we know that most resolutions fail within what a month right maybe after 30 or 60 days like 8% of the the people that started are still actually going forward with what they set out to to do. We tried to build programs and support around that. So, it doesn't just start with the sales moment of like, oh, hey, let's get as many people into this funnel as possible. It's like, what is the funnel itself after somebody purchases? So, we do one of the things we do is a 30-day challenge. We call it the annualbased 30 challenge. And, you know, we might have 20,000 30,000 people committing to, you know, one goal over the course of 30 days. It might be like, hey, I'm going to walk an hour a day. And obviously we have, you know, we placed our supplements which are tools to get healthier in kind of that experience. But that's how we approach it. We kind of think like, okay, what like if we are to do our best to support someone who wants to shift their identity and take out friction in that experience and process, how do we do that? >> Here's the thing. Every minute spent worrying about sales tax is a minute that could have been spent on your customers, your product, your brand, and growing your business. That's why so many Shopify brands work with TaxCloud. They take the complexity out of sales tax by handling registrations, filings, and compliance directly with the states. No complex setup, no waiting days for support, just a trusted partner who gets it right and gives you time back to focus on what really matters. Get back to running your business. Visit taxcloud.com/thread. That's taxcloud.com/thread. What I love about the challenges that Dean, what you got to do is it smooths out the surge. So like Q5 for individuals is kind of happening on a couple of levels. There's like the people thinking about reflecting and looking forward about who they want to become. But really this is mostly crowd- driven and the crowd crowds don't think they feel. That's why there's just a huge emotional surge in that moment. Even people who say it's cliche and roll their eyes at resolutions are writing their goals down for next year. Right? So what happens is then you you could like literally see this play out in the gym like and it like even from the personal development space I remember this happened in the personal development space people aren't necessarily going they're just thinking about their mindset and like what they want to make next year for a salary. Then we've got people in consumer health that that have chronic illness you know and they don't necessarily aspire to be anything other than what they used to be. And then you've got people like I think a probably a swath of hard soils customer base are people optimizing their health really healthy you know like lifesty like really strong lifestyle but at the same time like you can see in the gym it spikes in January and then it lasts it actually lasts until like early March. You just see everybody just kind of drop off. But that's going to the gym there's a community there. That's what I love about what you guys do with the challenge. We don't do a lot of that which anymore we did at Micro and Cellcore the business we exited in 2022. But anyways, I just wanted to jump in and say there's a literally a book called The Crowd that's 120 years old that explains this exact phenomenon that kicks in. >> Yeah. So, >> I appreciate that. Totally. Yeah. How do you connect people? How do you how do people have the experience of the crowd? Like I think a like so I just this weekend my wife and I did our first Hy Rocks and I don't know if you guys have been to one of these things. It is un It is insane. Like I remember the peak CrossFit Games era like we were a sponsor. I was in the middle of all of that and this feels higher energy than that even. It's crazy to me what you see and like communal fitness and communal health is like a really really powerful experience. >> But I wonder like how do you create that online? like how do you create a digital version of that for your people so they do benefit from what Dave's talking about in terms of getting a sense that they're a part of something bigger than themselves and connecting broadly. >> Yeah. Important aspect really important aspect of it in my mind. Um because if we go back again to behavior change, right? Like part of part of what helps somebody actually change their behavior is the environment that they put themselves in. So and the people that they're communicating with. So we clash everyone together. So we pulled people into our circle community. It's something that we built on the circle platform and we have you know we've engineered this to kind of facilitate the challenge in January and then after they graduate from the challenge they get put into the larger space where we've got you know 50,000 people in there. Much of them are active. People are sharing recipes all kinds of stuff. So yeah we clash them together. We put them in a cohort. We have a few few things that we've designed in the experience are like a kickoff call and so we try to incentivize like hey we know if somebody joins that kickoff call one of our leads Steve he's great he's our podcast host he leads the call if we know that they show up there then they're most likely to take the first module in the course there's a self-faced course that goes along and if they do that they're going to interact in the community so we just try to clash people together and one educate them or help them you know become educated on their next step and then clash them into the larger community when they finish. >> So, break down how does the journey, it sounds like, okay, so you're going to join this community. There's a 30-day challenge. How does it relate to the product and the offer and the mechanics of what you're actually trying to sell them in this moment? Give me take the people through a little bit like what is the relationship between the challenge, the offer, and the ongoing community. Yeah. So people will enter the challenge in one of two ways. One is they might come through the challenge funnel. Somebody else might have joined and it's like hey you know like wouldn't you love it if you have a couple of friends that would you know benefit from this share it with them or they might see an ad you know around the new year time and be like oh that might be something I want to try. So they might come in through wanting to do the program or they might come in through buying a product, right? They might have heard about us. They might buy beef organs and then, you know, that follow-up email after they purchase or sequence of emails, they might get introduced to the challenge. So they're going to pop, they're going to go in there. We try to keep it really simple in terms of like what action somebody should take after they join. We don't want to give them a list of like here's 20 things. And so we do some things on the tech side where they automatically get their account set up and everything to where they could just easily they can they already have the password they just go like straight into community. There's no additional friction steps there. And we have an offer right at that point a product offer. It's our it's a pretty appealing offer. We we try to get folks on subscription through that and it's you know it's all embedded in you know transform your health in the next year. like we we discount it. We we actually add in store credit this year. We did a little bit different psychology there and then there's another offer at the end of the challenge as well. So you keep keep people engaged and then we give them a bigger kind of incentive if they complete the program the steps right at the end. >> I was going to say the other way to think about aligning offer is we've got we actually do have a challenge on one of our brands but it's we don't lean into it for Q5. It's just like an perpetual evergreen offer. We we run traffic to it year round. >> This is evergreen. And the way I think about it is, you know, at least of all the brands I've worked with over my career, most of the growth comes from light buyers. So people who will never buy more than two times, right? But 20 to 30% of them will go on to become heavy buyers. So I just think about it in terms of penetrating the total addressable market with something that's more behavioral driven and not as much like, you know, the supplement. And then we from that group of people that we've sort of indoctrinated into the brand and just the way that that like we think we're we're dripping the offer throughout. But then I we'll make more we'll like make an offer at the end. But it's it's more about just brand alignment and then and just taking people from hopeless and unaware igniting some hope making them and then that at that point we're genuinely just marketing or remarketing to people who are problem and and solution aware. Well, I was going to make the quick point that our offers are designed more to be retention focused. >> I found, you know, people are really excited to invest in themselves in the new year. And so, in terms of taking the kind of the psychology of Black Friday and like deep discounting things, like I think that's a a really poor thing for a health brand to do. So, I feel like if you focus on kind of your offer in terms of transformation and these behavioral components and set up your offer to be retention focused, you'll have way more success and customer buy over the course of the year. >> Yeah. >> Um Dave, I want to go back to something you said that I think is an interesting unexpected data point. You said growth comes from the light purchaser, the casual purchaser was the phrase that you used. So, in other words, the bulk of your customers won't be these large LTV. They'll purchase once or twice. Tell me a little bit more about that. That might be counter to what I think people would assume in a business like this. >> Well, it's funny. I I would have thought the same thing. I think, you know, there's always some exception to the rule, but every I I'll just give you like the the broader example. What do you think CocaCola's buyer frequency is? Meaning over the course of one year? Gosh. >> I know. Mine. 7,000. I don't know. I don't know. It is really high. Really high. >> So my my my business partner Ryan used to drink like three a day. So when I first was asked this question, I thought, man, it's probably a thousand. >> It's 12. >> 12 a year, once a month. >> More than half of Coca-Cola's customer buys one to two times. Crazy. >> So when you go and you look at like when you look at buyer frequency numbers across any brand I've ever worked in and like health and wellness brands, it's between two and three. And that's driven down mainly by the light buyer who buys maybe once or twice ever, but maybe once in in in an entire year. It's called the law of buyer moderation. It's a it's a legit thing. I don't know that I've ever audited a brand. the the the the one like there was one brand that sort of broke the mold and they were like they were still 6040 60% live buyer 40% heavy buyer heavy buyer defined as someone who's purchased three or more times ever and this brand had people who had purchased 80 plus times. So this is why I say I like more I love what Dean does. I think what what Dean does is what I think is is I we we do that. I love it. But I think sometimes we think too much about acquiring the heavy buyer and then we cut off all the other people. Like brands grow by penetrating the total addressful market. It's by getting every buyer in that market you can possibly get. And the fact is most of those are going to be light buyers. So that's why price matters. That's why friction matters. That's why you need to make it as easy as possible because there's also something called the law of double jeopardy which says the more customers a brand has the more loyal they are and that's because that 20 to 30% heavy buyer ratio actually holds over time. So it's really just like a it's just a function of math at the end of the day >> the way super interesting and especially as you think about okay then that overlays in my mind with the depth of penetration and the cost of reach and part of why this moment becomes so important then right is that if we want to drive the broadest awareness into the total market as possible the cost to do that right now you have an advantage in that arena and so this is an area So Dean, you had some numbers though about volume and LTV in this period for you and then Dave, we'll use it to jump me off to sort of contrast that with your approach in terms of what we see. So Dean, how does that community and challenge engagement translate to business impact for Heart and Soil? >> For us, it's about an 8.2% increase to customer value over the course of a year. Volume-wise though, January is not our highest volume month. Now, there's a few reasons for that, and I'm actually curious your take, Taylor. Since you're familiar with our brand, I think last year we might have made the mistake of like cutting some of our ad budgets in January was so high that maybe that was a time for us to lean in a little bit more into the acquisition moment. But yeah, so we see purchase frequency about 10% higher, customer value about eight, eight or so percent higher. What's really interesting though, if you dig into the cohort data, is month two and three actually performs less than the other cohorts. So, it appears like there's something where they get really excited for this new habit and they might go through the program or whatever and then they kind of like lose it, but the cohort will come back in like month four or five and then they outperform all the rest of them in terms of customer value by 12 months. So, there's some really interesting stuff there that we're kind of looking into our retention strategy and seeing if there's anything we can do there to uncover. I think I think there is this contrast with the challenge offer that it's actually like such a high bar that from a volume standpoint it's the opposite of the frictionless purchase, right? Like come join a community for 30 days and engage heavily. It's like a really high ask, right? And so it would make sense to me that like sort of that would be higher LTV, lower potential volume versus like making it as simple to just try it. No, you don't have to go do all these other things. Like so there's there is some I think way in which I wonder if there's a way to pair these things together in a way. I know for me sometimes the ask feels really high to engage or enter a community is like man I wish there was a way to like sample it or like to to see if I want to before I have to commit to a 30 days of participating in something like is there a lower barrier moment to get into the thing that would be easier for me. So I think there's probably some balance there to to think about the distinction between those two things. >> Yeah, totally agree. And I think we we do run some funnels like that don't point to the program as well as well. And then we try to drift that in. We converted our 30-day challenge, the animalbased 30 challenge into an evergreen moment as well because we're kind of like we're looking at the LTV data for folks that go through it. We're like, "Wow, if someone engages with this, the LTV is like way higher." So we're trying to do that from an evergreen standpoint throughout the year as well and see kind of what what happens. So that's awesome. So Dave, let's just because for most of your breath and and tell us how many there are that you guys are currently working with for you this is the highest volume moment of the year in terms of new customer acquisition for most of them. Is that correct? >> That is correct. that they we have some other sort of like peak moments where we we will do a little bit more but they're they're based around events you know like where we have a like a big health event like biohacking conference or something that we'll go to we'll take a brand to we don't quite have a thousand brands I think I would be fully bald if we did that we we've got I think we've got a portfolio of five at this point but we we only really we we not only we we directly work in one so I'm actually the chief revenue officer in one of the brands hit the INC 5,000 two years in a row now actually hit top five for supplements in in 2024 and then the rest we've made we've made investment in and we kind of sit as adviserss but across the board you see January as the highest new customer acquisition month we take I you know what's interesting my like Dean Dean alluded to this my old background is in psychology I worked as clinical psych for a while I thought I was going to go be a psychologist but I take I've taken more of an engineering approach to growth both over the years and just purely like almost mathematical. I mean even when when we were first when I first think about Q5 sometimes I actually kind of roll my eyes a little bit even though I know all of these things to be true and I start going towards well the reason why they're the super cohort is because they made the earliest purchase in the year. So that there's a there's a time since purchase timeline where you actually look if we look even though if we you know we have more new customers in January they will if our buyer frequency is like three the people in January will buy four times they have more time to buy throughout the year but also I do believe they're sort of more they're more motivated. So across the board, we just try to go out and and acquire as many buyers as possible knowing that most of them are going to be live buyers and they're not if they don't purchase again have nothing to do with us because we do believe that retention is sort of table stakes. Good product, good support, good education, you know, experience that's congruent with the product. So all that stuff is table stakes and then we go and overindex where to your point Taylor by making it easier to purchase. We're looking at smaller pack sizes at a lower price but still great margin. I'm not above an extreme discount as long as I've got good margins. I don't I think premium is table stakes. I don't think discounting erodess brand at all. I've never heard somebody complain about getting a cheaper supplement to help you know them achieve their goals, right? or talk about how the brand is not what they thought it was because they got it at a discount. So, we really look at January as we're just going all in on new customers. And then we sort of what we call acquire and harvest throughout Q1 where we'll run another promo like in February or March to try and get that second purchase. If we can get two two and a half in that first quarter, we know like throughout the year that that LTV in in our flagship brand stimmer that one year LTV growth like it's coming up on close to 200%. And it's really I'm just playing those numbers and just making sure that the experience they're having a good experience with product. I'm okay. If they're not going to make more than two purchases at a time, I'm just going to go get more of them. And it's just it's it's the reason why I say it's Tim Duncan turn around bank shaws off the glass is it's it's really simple at the end of the day when you think about it. >> Yeah. And I I this is part of why I wanted to have you guys on is that there is a contrast in the approach here like a little bit in terms of the way you think about this period of time and what you want to try and generate out of this group of customers. And I think either one, you guys both run wildly successful businesses, but and it's funny like what I experience is that it follows your disposition as leaders. Like Dean's preference is always to sort of start he's a creative by definition and he starts in this like empathetic state of the customer and trying to create this communal connection towards this identity change. Like you heard him talk about it that's like very real for who he is. And Dave, you and I first bonded over a formula, a set of numerical inputs that generate an output. And I think each approach has its merits and opportunity. Dave, let's talk about some of the tactical offers. I liked the things you're describing when you think about creating entry points to supplements. One of the things I always struggle with is I have a cabinet full of supplements that I'm not totally sure if it worked or not or how I create impact is that these things are they're not all icy hot. They all don't give us a tingling sensation the first time that we use it. What is the experience that you're trying to create when you think about the offer design for somebody that allows them to have the experience that you want with your products? Like how do you think about the overlap of that sampling initiative versus like how long do you really need to engage the product for it to actually matter? How do you think about that when it comes to designing an entry point for customers? >> I'll have Dean go. I'm going to really probably disappoint you with my answer. >> Well, disappoint me first and then Dean can bring me back to life. >> This is going to sound bad. Okay. So, like when I say this, people's faces go blank, but I I don't care. Like, and this this is what I'm this is like my third contrarian take. I don't care because I know most people, no matter how good the experience is, they they don't care either. My wife just recently ordered a supplement maybe three or four months ago and she said it changed her life. Okay. You know how many months in a row she took it? >> Three. She had had enough. There was enough life changes, Dave. She had enough. >> Yes. But and then it's she stayed a subscriber and it started stacking up in our cabinet and I finally went in and canceled a subscription. >> So my my point is it like there's only so like you can't do anything about that. Like that's why I say it's table stakes. So when we first start working with the brand do they have clinical trials behind their products? Most supplement companies are no but but but a lot of them have done enough like work there. There are companies you can do like small study groups with to actually show that it does what it says it does. So, does the product do what it says it does? Do we have good education? Do we have good support? Do we get them the product fast? All of those things. And then I just know like no matter what, like I try to we try to set expectations like it's probably going to take 30 to 60 days, but also some people have taken our like our products and th something immediately. So, judge for yourself. So, we have like return windows, like you can return the product after 30 days, we've got like a 60-day guarantee on one of them, but the reason why I'm overindexing on live buyers the past couple of years and what we do to do that and decrease that friction is smaller pack sizes so they don't have to, you know, one of the most genius things I've ever seen was Element took their pack sizes from 30 to 18. And guess what? I order that thing every month and I'm out by week three. And you know, like hydration is maybe there's some different consumption patterns there. But that's that's my take. I was I was recently pitching like smaller pack sizes to a brand and they said, "Well, how do we know like how is that long enough for somebody to experience the product?" And I said, "I don't care." And they just went, >> "Yeah, wait. How could you say that?" >> Well, Dean, are you going white? Are you turning white? What do you think? >> I actually don't like I don't disagree with Dave much. You know, he's right. There's some realities that are very difficult to engineer through, I guess. But what is funny is like on the back end of Dave's answer, he gave some pretty practical things that one can do to increase that purchase purchase frequency, which in Element's case is probably people are using it, right? They're using it and then they're buying again and again again. I I just think from a philosophical perspective, if There's like two types of audiences again like one is one is someone who has an actual problem painpoint that is so painful that they will do about anything or they'll try about anything to try to resolve it. So I think if we engineer our touch points as a brand and the product to try to resolve that and support that person, we're going to be in a much better place than if we don't, you know, from from that standpoint. And the same goes for the new year knowing that people are trying to they're giving themselves permission to try something new from a health perspective on like if if you can play a little bit of a role in in helping them change that identity and be successful, then even if they let their product stack up, they might pause their sub subscription rather than cancel it. Or they might cancel it, but they're going to return again the next January because they trust you and they like the product. I like it. So there's there's definitely something for you, the listener, to wrestle with about what you believe about your capacity to modify human behavior with your product. Seems like we've got one market taker and one market maker here in terms of a little bit of how that's approached. But here's another question that I think as brands think about the tradeoff between volume and efficiency. How do you think about what is the opportunity cost to scale in this moment and to go acquire as many customers as possible at maybe the best prices you'll have opportunity all year? And so argument one would be take as many of them as you possibly can even at the cost to some short-term profitability because this is the cheapest available acquisition for some period of time. So go and reap that harvest today and push that CAC up maybe higher than you would normally be comfortable with. Or is this period of arbitrage about the efficiency of that acquisition and we're building our contribution dollars today? Where do you guys sit when you look at this market? What do you think the opportunity is for a business? Let's let's sort of set aside let's make this an X level debate. So, we'll set aside the nuance of capitalization and all of the things that go into that decision reality, but just generally as you approach it, do you see it as an opportunity for volume or is it an opportunity for efficiency in this moment of time? Dave, I'll start with you. I have a guess of where you're Well, it's it's volume for me all day, all day, every day. We I'll scale into my at least in our 60-day LTV in this moment. I'm cool with even in this moment scaling into our one-year LTV. I don't want to do that all the time. We also have some brands that are that are that have some funding to rely on. We don't like to do that. We try to grow these businesses, you know, not to rely on that funding. But I will I it's volume for me. I will get a little uncomfortable as we are scaling into those LT like 60-day one-year LTVs. But that there's like there's like two of our own like laws that we've we've come up with. One we call I call the Riley law of November. And it's like where your November is a good proxy for where your business might be in a normal month within the next six months of the year, but also there's like a law of January where like January really does, as I think we were saying earlier, set the tone for the actual year. So if we can overindex in that month, you know, we just with enough volume, we set ourselves up good for, you know, the good rest of the year. Oh man, it's what I'm struggling with right now. Last year we chose the efficiency equation. There's a couple reasons for that. One is we, you know, from a cash flow perspective, we wanted to build our inventory up more for the Q Q3 Q4 moment because we we were a little light the year year prior and so we wanted to make sure that we had enough cash to do that. we're 100% cash flow and so that was part of the reason is we didn't we wanted to preserve enough cash to be able to do that in kind of the middle of the year and then we also kind of know the margin degradation towards the end of the year and in Q4 and so for us to hit the goals that we set out to to hit we just were like you know what we're going to focus on efficiency here we had a pretty high target in terms of volume but man the other side of me thinking like Dave is like If we really would have pressed spend, the amount of customers that we could have acquired in January would have been unbelievable. And so maybe that was a missed opportunity for us. And that's what I'm, you know, struggling with going into this year. Not that it has to be on each any extreme to that, you know, question, but like where where are we going to fall this January? >> And I've only got 15 days to figure that out. >> All right. So So Dave, what would you say to convince him? convince him that he should substantially increase the volume of acquisition in January for Heart and Soil. >> I'd say he already knows the answer. >> Truth. Truth experience is more impactful than truth told. >> We're on a podcast, Dave. We can't give him the experience. We got to give him truth told here. Come on. No, but but I think it's in kind of what we're saying like look at if so so go go into your January cohort and look at the and then but look at the so take your total customers from January and the total orders they made throughout the year. I bet it's higher than any cohort throughout the rest of the year. Which means the more customers you have in January when you really start cranking on, you know, sales and and and offers in Q4, you give yourself a greater chance to harvest more of that later in the year, which will offset the media degradation towards the end of the year. And this is why we call acquire and harvest is we acquire as much as we can and then we will harvest them throughout the year. And even though I believe, you know, I'm overindexing on this light buyer talk, etc., etc., 20 to 30 like 30 Dean yours probably like 35 to 40% because I remember what it was when I worked at this at your sister brand right it is a little bit higher because this is a foodbased supplement >> so I mean I don't know if that helps convince but I would that's that's what I would say >> it does it does help convince I think I like you said I think I know the answer already and there's about 10% more orders you know over the course of a year with that cohort compared to any other So, makes sense to >> It's funny this is no different than my business, right? Like when we look at we have a new customer revenue goal for 2026 for CTC. If you miss January and February, it's really hard to get to that number because every new cohort you're going to acquire has less time to contribute to the total, right? And so hitting January and February there's sort of this like rule in age service business that by March like you know your year because you know usually your your retention is on a calendar basis. So you know okay how many of your customers did you retain coming from December to January and how did you do in your January February new business cohorts like so much of your business is baked after that period of time. Now, of course, there's a ton of blocking, tackling to get all the way through it, don't get me wrong, but for the most part, those cohorts are so long with so much contributing dollars throughout the year that you have to press all the gas in January and February. And it feels like this is really no different for these subscription high LTB businesses. If you don't go out and get those January, February cohorts, like the July cohort just doesn't have enough time to save you on an annual calendar basis. It just doesn't. >> Right. >> Right. Well, the July of course no matter what. So, >> I mean, we I overstacked Q3 so hard people think I'm crazy. And just for a little bit more lift, there's like hardly anything you can do. But if you've got a huge crop from Q1, I I've overindexed so hard to crush Q1. Also, just for the confidence of the team and the founders to know we're rolling through the year. And it's for that same thing, Taylor. As we get into April, if I've hit or exceeded forecast four months in a row, >> we're we're on a roll. And I know what once we get into half the year, I can miss in Q3 and we're good. I'm telling a good story because we've got a and it's really really just comes down to we're just we're harvesting as many new customers as we can. >> It's a momentum game. Like so you you're taking advantage of we have a cultural imperative which is people are I'm stealing this phrase. They're giving themselves proactive permission to change their identity. You're benefiting from an advertising mechanic around the inventories price of arbitrage and then you have a game to set up momentum for all 12 months of the year in this business. And so this is it time to press the gas and go in these periods of time. >> Early momentum lowers future friction. Early momentum. >> Great. Also, who's Riley and how did he get a lot named after him in November? >> That's my business partner, Ryan Riley. You've met him before. He so I it was like six years ago. I heard him say I I should name it after myself because I joke with him he steals all my ideas. But he I'd heard him say to the team, "Hey, we're going to hit a million dollars this month." And you know what that means? Probably about 6 months million dollars is going to be the month. And I started just paying attention to that. And I just named it the Riley Law of November because every brand in successful supplements that I've worked in like across the board, every brand I've seen if we no what we do in November ends up becoming a proxy for a normal month within six months. I like it. >> Anything else in terms of channel exploration that you guys do differently? So if this is the month to go out and harvest, we know meta matters. Where else are you guys finding opportunities or pockets in the health and wellness space to drive incremental demand right now? like what do you is there anything interesting on your radars that's popping up as being super important or effective? >> Partnerships are really big for us. I I actually use also use January as a way to explore some new things. I don't know that I do a lot of like you know incrementality testing of new channels and things. I'm usually kind of just doing that throughout the year, but we're going to we're really going to lean into performance PR a little bit more. >> We're going to actually work with some CPA based partners. We're going to we're going to run some TV performance TV on a CPA basis. So I'm not I'm not paying for the ads spit unless I get a new customer and we will negotiate like a rate that >> what's the attribution how how do you assign credit to that? >> Yes. >> I don't know yet. >> I might I might the most conservative fashion possible. That's how Yeah. >> Yeah. >> That's interesting though. That's >> Yeah. I think we're just we're really going to overindex on partnerships. We're going to get our healthcare practitioner channel more involved next year. So we actually outside of D TOC we have a healthcare practitioner channel and I've started to think of them like they can actually both grow each other versus in a silo. I've been a little sheepish on doing that because of meta health restrictions. I don't want to be seen as a, you know, a health care company and lose my conversions objective. But, you know, a white white coat syndrome is real, both good and bad. And if I have a doctor talking about my product, it really helps ignite hope. This is a new this is a solution. But outside of media channels, it's really meta at the end of the day. We've got a long way to go there on all of our brands. >> Dean, what about you guys? Anything you're exploring? >> Yeah, much of the same. Lean leaning really hard into partnerships, influencers. We also partner with a number of brands on the AB30 program and so we penetrate their audiences as well through doing some cross promotion there. And then you know our founder is a health voice and he you know talks a lot about this come January and gets you know the algorithm gives him a lot more views and and new audience this time of year compared to July. >> I've seen I've seen some like comparisons against Brian Johnson. Is he like specifically like going headtohead with him on some things? right now. There's some interesting content I've come across of those two kind of contrasting each other over specifically around the animal-based diet versus like the sort of more vegan thing. It's been interesting. >> Yeah, it's really interesting there. You know, I think I think Paul had a little bit of a bone to pick with him months ago. I can't remember what the topic was. It wasn't about him personally. It was like one thing he disagreed with and then they ended up connecting and becoming friends and they just debate back and forth now. And I I really like it because, you know, one thing that I can say about Paul is that he's always trying to figure out what the truth actually is. And some people sometimes dawned him on that that he's changed his mind on certain things. But I actually appreciate it. And so it's really good dialogue between the two. >> Well, there you go, guys. It's the opportunity. If this is your moment, if it's Q5, both of these guys I find to be incredibly generous. They're both on X. They'll answer your DMs. They would love to pour into the community and offer the wisdom that they have. Even if it's even if it's just the spoken word and you're going to have to live it for yourself to ultimately believe it, you can at least be able to hear from them and then go back and tell them they were right after after the fact. But if you need help thinking about the potential scale that's available to you, how much volume is the potential and the trade-off that Dean is wrestling with? I know my takeaway from this is to go take a look and think about go back and look at January look at our spending AM model that you got all right where is the threshold where could we press up against that bound to try and make sure that we set the volume of new customer acquisition up appropriately and one of the things I'll tell you is that if you're coming off of a year where new customer acquisition wasn't up dramatically this choice is going to be even harder because you're actually going to experience a little bit of a depression in your returning customer base. Don't let that hide for you the fact that the engine is the new customer acquisition and you don't want to end up in that death spiral. So if you need help processing any of that, we're here as always. Hit these gentlemen up. Dean, what's your name on X? >> Dean Crave, what are you? >> Pretty straightforward. >> Dave is getting these middle initials, man. You just got to go find the original name, guys, and get them back, man. I was too late. 2009 was still too late to get Dave Huffman for something. >> Well guys, it's always a pleasure. I appreciate you stopping by. Sorry about the slight audio lags on my side, but I appreciate you both and good luck in Q5.
