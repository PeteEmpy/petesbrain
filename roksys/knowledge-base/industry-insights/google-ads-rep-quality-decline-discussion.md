## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Google Ads account management and Google rep experiences
**Reason**: This Reddit post discusses a common and relevant topic for Google Ads practitioners - the quality and value of Google account representatives. While it provides insight into advertiser experiences with Google reps and their tendency to push budget increases, it lacks actionable insights, specific strategies, or data-driven recommendations that would make it highly valuable for a knowledge base.
