## Summary

- Andromeda audience targeting consistently underperformed compared to manually selected audiences
- Manual audience selection yielded significantly better ROAS, with one audience returning 800% ad spend
- ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) remains more effective than Meta's recommended campaign strategies
- Meta's generic advice about creativity and campaign structure appears ineffective for real performance optimization

## Key Insights

- Manual audience targeting can significantly outperform automated audience selection
- Practitioners should continuously test and layer custom audiences instead of relying solely on platform-recommended approaches

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve had 3 consecutive weeks of Andromeda performing below ROAS targets. While audiences I specified beat the targets.</p> <p>Meta, and the X “Meta experts” keep recycling the same spiel: “Run CBO”, then when it doesn’t work “it’s your CreATIveS”. The whole 1-campaign, 1-adset, 40-creatives mantra seems like a way to distract us from the fact we’re just donating money to Meta at the moment.</p> <p>I’ve tested different hooks, angles, images, carousels, videos etc. Marginal improvement.</p> <p>The REAL needle mover has been targeting the audiences I know perform strong. And running multiple of them.</p> <p>In the last 3 weeks I uncovered 7 audiences that beat my &quot;No detailed targeting set&quot; Andromeda audience. One of which returned 800% on ad spend!</p> <p>ABO still remains king. So I'd keep choosing and layering those Adset audiences.</p> <p>Is anyone actually having success with Andromeda? Or having a similar experience to me? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HopefulReality2"> /u/HopefulReality2 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p68kg3/stop_relying_on_andromeda_its_broken_and_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p68kg3/stop_relying_on_andromeda_its_broken_and_i/">[comments]</a></span>
