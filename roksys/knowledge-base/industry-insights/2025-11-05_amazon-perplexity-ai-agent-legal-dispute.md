## Amazon threatens Perplexity over AI shopping agent

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

Perplexity AI has **received a threat from Amazon demanding that the startup block its AI agent **on the Comet browser from shopping on Amazon's platform on users' behalf.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* Amazon repeatedly requested that Perplexity get rid of the retailer from its Comet experience, citing a **"significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience"** that the AI agent provides to users.

* Perplexity rejected Amazon's demands and accused the e-commerce giant of using **"legal threats and intimidation to block innovation and make the world worse for people,"** according to the company's blog post response.

* The AI agent on Perplexity's Comet browser can make purchases and fee comparisons autonomously for users, with **user credentials stored locally** rather than on Perplexity's servers to maintain privacy and security.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This dispute highlights emerging regulatory questions around AI agents and website usage rights.** Amazon** **develops competing tools like "Buy For Me" and "Rufus," **suggesting the law challenge may protect market position as much as address user experience concerns.

## Unknown number calling? It’s not random…

The BBC caught scam call center workers on hidden cameras as they laughed at the people they were tricking. One worker bragged about making $250k from victims. 

The disturbing truth? 

Scammers don’t pick phone numbers at random. They buy your data from brokers. Once your data is out there, it’s not just calls. It’s phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. 

That’s why we recommend Incogni: They delete your info from the web, monitor and follow up automatically, and continue to erase data as new risks appear.

**Case Study**

## How AI slashed healthcare support response times

* MatrixCare, a **cloud-based EHR provider serving 13,000 US healthcare organizations**, faced 20-hour average response times for customer support requests.

* Their fragmented platform of nearly 20 separate systems caused confusion, with **60% of support calls being user coaching** rather than technical issues.

* They deployed **DRUID AI agents across Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, and mobile apps** to automate routine queries and triage customer requests 24/7.

* **Support response times dropped dramatically with 96% accuracy**, reducing volumes and improving customer reviews across all healthcare settings significantly.
