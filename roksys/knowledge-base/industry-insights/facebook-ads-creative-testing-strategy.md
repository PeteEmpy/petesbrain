## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like most people here, I've been team ABO for years. That said, I wanted to give Andromeda a shot, so I setup 2 simple campaigns:</p> <p>1 - Scale campaign (CBO, 1 ad set, 25 of my top ads, etc)<br /> 1 - Testing campaign (ABO, 3-5 ad sets, 1-4 ads per adset, etc)</p> <p>My method is $500/day per ad-set, give 3-5 days to stabilize unless way off metrics. If CPAs, CTR, CPC, hook rate, etc all hit a certain threshold, I scale 20%. I do this once more after ~7 days. </p> <p>If everything maintains, I move the ad over to the scale campaign. As expected though, almost none of the new creatives I move over get any spend. </p> <p>Typically this is why I favor ABO as I can control this, but I'm trying to give Andro a fair shot... but Im hitting a brick wall after every test by new creatives not getting any spend at all. I end up letting my creatives ride far longer in the testing campaign as they performing better than in the scale. </p> <p>Daily spend $5-7k FYI</p> <p>What are you guys doing to mitigate this?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Formal3117"> /u/Ok_Formal3117 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p6ke5y/testing_scale_campaign_how_do_you_work_in_new/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p6ke5y/testing_scale_campaign_how_do_you_work_in_new/">[comments]</a></span>
