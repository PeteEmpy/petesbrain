**Case Study**

———————————————————————————

## How AI boosted security efficiency

* **Lemonade processes through its app,** but faced overwhelming security alert volumes requiring manual investigation.

* Manual alert management was **time-consuming and inconsistent**, leading to false positives and missed threats across their growing platform.

* They deployed **Dropzone AI to autonomously investigate security alerts** and provide detailed reports.

* The implementation **reduced manual workload and enabled 24/7 monitoring** without expanding headcount, allowing analysts to focus on higher-value tasks.

**AI News Story **

## The United States’  "electron gap"

* OpenAI has **urged the White House to expand national energy capacity by 100 gigawatts a year**, warning that the U.S. risks falling behind China in AI development without major power infrastructure growth. 

* The appeal follows OpenAI’s **ambitious infrastructure buildouts with Oracle and SoftBank**, which demand unprecedented power levels. China added 429 gigawatts of capacity last year compared with 51 in the U.S.

* The statement reframes AI competition around energy use, **positioning power generation as the next frontier of national tech strategy.**
