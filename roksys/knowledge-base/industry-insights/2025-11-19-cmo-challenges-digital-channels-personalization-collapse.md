## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: CMO challenges with digital marketing channels and personalization strategies
**Reason**: Highly relevant to marketing strategy and the need to rethink digital approaches, which increasingly involves AI-powered solutions for personalization and channel management. However, the preview doesn't explicitly mention AI tools or automation, focusing more on the strategic crisis CMOs face, which makes it contextually valuable but not directly actionable for AI implementation.
