## Summary

- White-label web designer questions why PPC agencies build their own landing pages
- Argues specialization increases profitability: agencies focus on ads, specialists handle post-click optimization
- Identifies potential barriers: trust/control issues, perceived cost savings, lack of reliable partners
- Highlights technical requirements: sub-2 second load times, mobile-first design, GTM implementation
- Discussion about agency workflow optimization and resource allocation

## Key Insights

- Landing page development diverts PPC specialists from their core competency of campaign optimization
- Technical landing page requirements (speed, mobile optimization, tracking) require specialized skills
- Many agencies struggle with build vs buy decisions due to control concerns or lack of trusted partners
- Post-click optimization is equally important as pre-click strategy but often deprioritized
- Agency profitability may suffer when generalists handle specialized technical tasks

# A question for PPC pros who still build their *own* client landing pages... Why?

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I'm a web designer who operates as a white-label partner for PPC agencies and freelance media buyers.</p> <p>My entire business is built on a simple specialization:</p> <ul> <li>My partners focus 100% on the 'pre-click' (strategy, audience, creative).</li> <li>I focus 100% on the 'post-click' (the &lt;2s load time, the mobile-first UI, the GTM implementation).</li> </ul> <p>This model works. The clients get results, and the agency gets to focus on what they're actually good at (buying ads).</p> <p>But I'm genuinely curious: I still see <em>so many</em> PPC pros and small agencies trying to do it all themselves. They're spending hours fighting with Elementor, debugging plugins, or trying to optimize a client's 10-year-old theme... all time they <em>aren't</em> spending on optimizing campaigns.</p> <p>So, for those of you who <em>don't</em> outsource this:</p> <ol> <li>Is it a trust/control issue (you're worried a partner will mess it up)?</li> <li>Is it a cost issue (you assume it's just cheaper to DIY, even if it takes you hours)?</li> <li>Have you just not been able to find a <em>reliable</em> technical partner?</li> </ol> <p>Genuinely trying to understand the bottleneck, because from the outside, it looks way less profitable and way more stressful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard-Shame-3364"> /u/Standard-Shame-3364 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqtvlt/a_question_for_ppc_pros_who_still_build_their_own/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqtvlt/a_question_for_ppc_pros_who_still_build_their_own/">[comments]</a></span>

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Landing page development and agency workflow optimization for PPC
**Reason**: This article addresses a relevant aspect of PPC operations (landing page development and post-click optimization) and raises valid questions about agency workflows and specialization. However, it's primarily a discussion prompt rather than actionable content, and appears to have self-promotional undertones from a service provider seeking clients.
