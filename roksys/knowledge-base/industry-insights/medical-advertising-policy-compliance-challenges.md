# Trouble with advertising medical procedures.

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wondering if anyone can help me out here. One of my clients is a urologist looking to advertise for vasectomy procedures on Google search. We created a landing page with a vasectomy focus and set up keywords, ad headlines, and descriptions to match. Google will not allow us to launch the campaign due to some violation of the birth control, fertility, and testing policy. But, I can clearly see in the google ads transparency center that many advertisers across the United States are advertising for vasectomies. Many are using similar ad copy as well so I don’t see the problem. </p> <p>Does anyone have any experience with something similar or circumnavigating a similar issue? </p> <p>I also tried setting up a general urology campaign with the mindset that I could start broad with general urology keywords and slowly inject vasectomy based keywords over time. Google didn’t even allow me to launch that campaign. They flagged phrases like “urologist near me”.</p> <p>I looked into google’s healthcare-related services application but none of the selections seemed to align with my client. If anyone has any insight or experience here I’d greatly appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/baucemane"> /u/baucemane </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqd73i/trouble_with_advertising_medical_procedures/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqd73i/trouble_with_advertising_medical_procedures/">[comments]</a></span>
