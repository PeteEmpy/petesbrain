## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I had a question regarding the transition from leveraging GTM client to sGTM. We are currently advertising on Google, Facebook, Reddit &amp; Linkedin, it's gotten us to basically 80% -85% conversion matching (platforms vary). Will this switch immediately increase our matching? Or rather saying, what's the best approach to include sGTM (assuming it increases matching)?</p> <p>Also, if we go with sGTM, will we need to use various CAPIs that the platforms use?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pity_Party8"> /u/Pity_Party8 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqf2fd/gtm_sgtm_capi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqf2fd/gtm_sgtm_capi/">[comments]</a></span>
