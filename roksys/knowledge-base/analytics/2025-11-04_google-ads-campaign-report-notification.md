For account security, reports are only sent to users on this Google Ads  
account. If there are people that you want to send reports to without  
giving full access to your account, you can give them email-only access.  
Keep in mind that you’ll need administrative access to the account to do  
this. If you have email-only access to this account, you’ll need to  
download this report as a table.
