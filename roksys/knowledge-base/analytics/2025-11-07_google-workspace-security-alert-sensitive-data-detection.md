## Summary

- Google Workspace identified security gaps in the organization's account (petere@roksys.co.uk)
- Critical issue: 155 outgoing files or emails contain sensitive data, posing breach risk
- Positive security measures in place: malware/phishing protection enabled, strong passwords required, 2SV active for all users
- Action required to review and address sensitive data sharing vulnerabilities
- Email received November 7, 2025 from Google Workspace Team

## Key Insights

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) concern: 155 instances of sensitive data found in outgoing communications indicates potential compliance and security risks that need immediate attention
- Multi-layered security status is mixed - while authentication (2SV, strong passwords) and malware protection are properly configured, data sharing controls require enhancement
- This is a system-generated security audit notification requiring admin-level review and remediation actions to prevent costly data breaches
- The organization should prioritize implementing stricter DLP policies and employee training on sensitive data handling
