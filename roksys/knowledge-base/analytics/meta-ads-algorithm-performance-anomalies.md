## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday I launched a CBO campaign with a €150 daily budget. Broad Advantage audience, just as Meta and all our beloved gurus recommend.<br /> 3 ads for the same product, but with different angles.</p> <p>Yesterday, the first of the 3 ads got a few ATCs and 2 purchases at a decent CPA, the second got 1 purchase at a slightly higher CPA, and the third got 0 purchases and 0 ATCs.</p> <p>Well, surprise surprise: today (it’s 01:00 p.m. here) Meta has spent almost the entire budget on the ad that yesterday generated 0 purchases and 0 ATCs, and of course today it’s also produced 0 purchases and 0 ATCs.</p> <p>And the ad that performed well yesterday?<br /> Today it spent 0. And not “zero” as in “almost nothing”, literally <em>zero</em>, not even a cent, as if it were blocked.</p> <p>Meta’s magic…</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous-Metal-281"> /u/Infamous-Metal-281 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p6bdms/ok_metas_algo_dont_even_understands_his_own_stats/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p6bdms/ok_metas_algo_dont_even_understands_his_own_stats/">[comments]</a></span>

## Scoring Analysis

**Primary Topic**: Meta Ads Campaign Performance Anomalies
**Reason**: While the post highlights a specific complaint about Meta's algorithm behavior, it provides an anecdotal observation about unexpected ad spending patterns without deeper strategic insights or systemic analysis of Meta's ad delivery mechanisms.
