## Summary

- Google Apps Script 'Untitled project' experienced a server-side failure on November 4, 2025
- The dailyProductCheck function failed to complete, running for approximately 30 minutes before timing out
- Error was a Google server error (not a code issue), suggesting temporary platform instability
- Time-based trigger was set to run at 5:31 AM GMT but failed to complete by 6:01 AM GMT

## Key Insights

- The script ran for the maximum execution time (30 minutes) before failing, indicating either a timeout issue or server-side problem rather than immediate code failure
- The function name 'dailyProductCheck' suggests this is likely a product feed or inventory monitoring automation that requires attention
- Server errors from Google Apps Script typically resolve themselves, but recurring failures may require script optimization or error handling improvements
- The unnamed project ('Untitled project') should be properly labeled for better tracking and maintenance
