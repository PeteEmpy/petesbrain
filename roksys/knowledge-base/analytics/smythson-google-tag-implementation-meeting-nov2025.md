Hi Lauryn,

Would 6th November at 4:00 PM CET work for you? The slot is subject to availability, however, we can proceed to reschedule the appointment for the earliest available time.

Once rescheduled, you’ll receive an “Edit Appointment” link, which you can use to adjust the time at your convenience.
