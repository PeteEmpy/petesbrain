## Summary

- Single Google Apps Script entry for Roksys domain tracking script metadata and usage
- Script is associated with a Google Spreadsheet container and owned by petere@roksys.co.uk
- Script shows no execution history (0 runs), no dependencies, and no library usage as of January 2025
- Script is not opted out and has no compatibility issues reported
- Appears to be a newly created or unused automation script within the Roksys technical infrastructure

## Key Insights

- This represents internal technical infrastructure documentation rather than marketing strategy content
- Zero execution count suggests the script is either newly deployed, in testing, or not yet activated for production use
- The systematic tracking of script metadata indicates mature technical operations and governance practices
- Script is linked to a specific spreadsheet (ID: 17Vr_aWFOOJj7RXbKqj3-7ccYt7ZFZ8apjEVkGhrTCHc), suggesting potential data processing or reporting automation
