## Summary

- Scheduled technical support appointment for Google Ads tag implementation on November 14, 2025, 6:30-7:30 PM IST
- Requires admin access attendees for both website source code and Google Ads/Analytics accounts
- Pre-appointment requirements include accepting calendar invite, backing up website, and having Google Meet ready for screen sharing
- Google support does NOT cover server-side tagging, GTM 360, or Measurement Protocol - those require separate specialist contact
- Maximum 3 reschedules allowed; appointment will be cancelled if required attendees decline or are absent

## Key Insights

- This is a hands-on implementation session requiring both technical (developer) and account admin (Google Ads/Analytics) personnel present
- Google explicitly disclaims responsibility for any campaign spending increases or website functionality issues resulting from implementation changes
- Support is limited to standard tagging only - advanced implementations (server-side, GTM 360, Measurement Protocol) require different support channels
- The 3-reschedule limit and required attendee acceptance indicates Google's focus on ensuring productive sessions with properly prepared clients
