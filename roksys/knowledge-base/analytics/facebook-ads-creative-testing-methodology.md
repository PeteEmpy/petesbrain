# I scaled from $1k/day to $7k/day by fixing ONE thing (and it wasn't my bidding strategy)

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Everyone's obsessed with campaign structure. CBO vs ABO. Three ad sets or five. Advantage Plus or manual placements.</p> <p>I spent six months tweaking my account structure like a psychopath. Duplicate this campaign. Try broad targeting. Switch to Lookalikes. Back to broad.</p> <p>You know what actually changed everything? I stopped testing random shit and started testing with intention.</p> <p>Here's what I mean. I was launching 20 to 30 ads per week thinking volume was the answer. Different hooks. Different images. Different videos. Just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping something stuck.</p> <p>My cost caps would spend one day and completely die the next. I'd wake up to two Shopify notifications after spending $800 the day before. Brutal.</p> <p>Then I started using something I call the Creative Hit Rate Tracker. Basically a spreadsheet where I map out every single test BEFORE I launch it.</p> <p>For each ad I write down what I'm actually testing. Not just &quot;new angle&quot; but specifically which desire, which avatar segment, which awareness level.</p> <p>Example. I sell a cat water fountain. Instead of just making ads about &quot;hydration&quot; I got specific.</p> <p>Desire one: I want my senior cat to live longer. Desire two: I want to avoid expensive vet bills. Desire three: I want my cat to stop peeing outside the litter box.</p> <p>Three completely different emotional drivers. Three different ad sets. Each with three image variations but the SAME copy focused on that one desire.</p> <p>Whichever ad set gets the most spend plus conversions in 72 hours? That's my winner. Now I know what people actually want.</p> <p>Then I test angles on that winning desire. Different stories. Different positioning. Rock bottom moments that make someone say &quot;that's exactly what happened to me.&quot;</p> <p>One angle about a $4,000 vet bill outperformed everything else by 300%. Now THAT became my advertorial. That became my landing page. That became the foundation for 50 more creative tests.</p> <p>My hit rate went from maybe one winner out of 30 tests to one winner out of every five tests. Sometimes three out of five.</p> <p>The campaign structure barely changed. I'm still running cost caps in a basic CBO. One campaign. Ad sets grouped by angle. That's it.</p> <p>What changed was I stopped guessing and started isolating variables. I test desires until I find one that converts. Then I test angles on that desire. Then I test landing pages with that angle.</p> <p>Most people are testing everything at once. New desire plus new angle plus new format plus new landing page. Then when it fails they have no idea what was actually wrong.</p> <p>If you're stuck at $1k or $2k per day and nothing seems to scale consistently, I'd bet money your problem isn't your bidding strategy or your budget.</p> <p>It's that you don't actually know WHY your winners are winning. So you can't replicate them.</p> <p>Start tracking your tests properly. Write down your hypothesis before you launch. Figure out your dominant desire. Build from there.</p> <p>That's what took me from inconsistent $1k days to consistent $7k days at 35% margin.</p> <p>Would love to hear if anyone else has tried something similar or if you think I'm completely wrong about this. Always open to being challenged.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dazqn"> /u/Dazqn </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p64uqx/i_scaled_from_1kday_to_7kday_by_fixing_one_thing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1p64uqx/i_scaled_from_1kday_to_7kday_by_fixing_one_thing/">[comments]</a></span>
