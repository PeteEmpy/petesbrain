## Summary

- Scheduled Tag Implementation appointment with Google Technical Support team on Nov 6, 2025, 5:30-6:30 PM Asia/Calcutta timezone
- Requires attendees with admin access to website source code and Google Ads/Analytics accounts to accept calendar invite
- Pre-call requirements include backing up website, accepting calendar invite, and having Google Meet available for screen sharing
- Google will not assist with server-side tagging, GTM 360, or Measurement Protocol implementation - separate resources provided
- All implementation changes are at client's own risk with no guaranteed results; full website backup recommended before modifications

## Key Insights

- Action Required: Accept calendar invite and complete pre-call checklist within 1 business day for appointment on Nov 6, 2025
- Critical attendees needed: someone with website source code admin access AND someone with Google Ads/Analytics administrative access
- Scope limitations: Google Technical Support excludes server-side tagging, GTM 360, and Measurement Protocol - contact Account Manager for these services
- Risk mitigation: Backup website before call as changes may affect website functionality and campaign spending; client assumes full responsibility for all implementations
- Appointment can be rescheduled maximum 3 times; will be canceled if all attendees decline invite
