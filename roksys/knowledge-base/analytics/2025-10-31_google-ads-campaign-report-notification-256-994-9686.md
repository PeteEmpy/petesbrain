## Summary

- Automated notification from Google Ads indicating a Campaign report is ready for review
- Report accessible for customer account 256-994-9686 (petere@roksys.co.uk)
- Includes information about report access permissions and security protocols
- Contains links to view the specific report and learn about Google Ads reporting features
- Reminder about user management and email-only access options for report sharing

## Key Insights

- This is a system-generated notification rather than substantive content - it signals that campaign data is available for analysis but doesn't contain the actual performance metrics
- The email emphasizes security protocols, noting reports are only sent to authorized account users, which is important for maintaining client data confidentiality
- For knowledge base purposes, this represents report cadence documentation (dated 2025-10-31 01:32:36) that could help track reporting schedules and automated delivery
- The presence of email-only access options suggests opportunities for client reporting workflows without granting full account access

For account security, reports are only sent to users on this Google Ads  
account. If there are people that you want to send reports to without  
giving full access to your account, you can give them email-only access.  
Keep in mind that you’ll need administrative access to the account to do  
this. If you have email-only access to this account, you’ll need to  
download this report as a table.
