## Summary

- Peter Empson provided the Google Ads conversion tag ID (AW-1069535771) for National Design Academy (NDA) website
- Google Technical Solutions clarified that NDA and NMA (National Make-up Academy) require separate Ads accounts and conversion IDs
- NMA Enhanced Conversions For Leads is working correctly but requires resumed daily data uploads (none in last 7 days)
- Each institution needs its own AW ID from Tools > Data manager > Google Tag for proper conversion tracking
- Account manager validation required for new conversion tracking implementation on NDA site

## Key Insights

- Multiple brands under same management need separate Google Ads accounts and conversion tracking - cannot share AW IDs across different domains/properties
- Enhanced Conversions for Leads requires consistent daily data uploads to function properly; 7+ days of inactivity indicates a broken integration
- Proper conversion tag implementation requires: correct AW ID retrieval from Ads account > implementation on site > account manager validation > 7-day monitoring period
- Google Support operates on one Ads account per ticket basis - multi-property issues require separate support cases

Please use that AW ID for the NDA site and to validate that you would have to reach out to your account manager for a new case.

However, you will need to upload recent data as we can see that there has been no new uploads in the last 7 days to this conversion action "NMA Enhanced Conversions For Leads". Once you confirm that you have resumed daily uploads we will monitor it for 7 days.
