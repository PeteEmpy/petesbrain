Hi Devin,

I hope that you are well and thank you for your time on the call yesterday! We look forward to receiving the deck to review.

We need to change the tracking/conversion action for the EUR and ROW accounts, could you share with us the best point of contact from the Google tech support team to set this up please?

Kind regards,
Lauryn
