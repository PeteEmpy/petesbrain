## Summary

- Scheduled Google Technical Support appointment for tag implementation on November 6, 2025, 5:30-6:30 PM Asia/Calcutta timezone
- Requires admin access attendees for both website source code and Google Ads/Analytics accounts to be present on the call
- Pre-call requirements include accepting calendar invite, backing up website, and having Google Meet ready for screen sharing
- Appointment can be rescheduled maximum 3 times and will be cancelled if required attendees decline or are not present
- Google does not provide support for server-side tagging, GTM 360, or Measurement Protocol through this service

## Key Insights

- This is a hands-on technical implementation session requiring both technical (developer with source code access) and business (Ads/Analytics admin) stakeholders to be present
- Google explicitly disclaimers responsibility for results and spending increases, requiring client acknowledgment that changes are made at their own risk
- The support service has clear limitations - excludes server-side tagging, GTM 360, and Measurement Protocol, which require separate support channels or account manager involvement
- Multiple team members from both Smythson (Beth Simpson, Alex Clarke, Lauryn Sobers) and Roksys (Peter R) are included, suggesting this is a client-agency collaborative implementation
