# Google Forwarding Numbers Question (Tag Manager/Ads)

## Summary

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have GFN setup for a website and I have question about the implementation/troubleshooting it.</p> <p>If I have for number on the site - say its (111) 222-3333 as the display and the link is tel:1112223333</p> <p>What do I put as the GFN number in both google ads and tag manager? (where it asks what the number is on the site) Do I put the (111) 222-3333 with the parenthesis or do i put the link number (just the numbers themselves)? Ex: 1112223333.</p> <p>I'm asking because I have 2 google ad campaigns where this works and I get leads often via this... but then I have one, who constantly gets call leads for the extensions and bookings via an online scheduler on the site.. but they never gets calls on their site. Despite 60+ conversions for the month calls/schedules 0 came from the tel: click on the site, which I find hard to believe. Especially since im tracking tel: clicks as secondary and they have over 2 dozen clicks.</p> <p>The ones I have working the display numbers nor my tag/ads have have ( ) in them - but this company does on their site.. so I'm not sure it's working but I can't figure out why.</p> <p>In that regard, is there a way to test that this is working without clicking the ad? I'm not in the region her local business is in so I'd have to enable location interest to test it. Was wondering if there's an easier way to test to see if it's actually changing these numbers and forwarding them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/i4mt3hwin"> /u/i4mt3hwin </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqxso0/google_forwarding_numbers_question_tag_managerads/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1oqxso0/google_forwarding_numbers_question_tag_managerads/">[comments]</a></span>
