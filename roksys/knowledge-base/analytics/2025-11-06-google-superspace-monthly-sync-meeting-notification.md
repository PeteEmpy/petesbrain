- Meeting organized by Jasmine Chauhan (Google) with Peter Empson (Roksys) and Sinead Hurley (Google) as attendees
- Virtual meeting accessible via Google Meet with phone dial-in options available
- Peter Empson's attendance marked as optional
- Part of ongoing monthly coordination between Google and Superspace teams

## Key Insights

- This is a calendar notification rather than substantive knowledge content - primarily administrative in nature
- Indicates an established relationship with regular monthly touchpoints between Google and Superspace requiring Roksys involvement
- The optional attendance status suggests Peter Empson may be a secondary participant or observer rather than core decision-maker
- Meeting format (30 minutes, virtual) suggests tactical sync rather than strategic planning session
