## Transcript

Hello, welcome to the e-commerce playbook podcast. I'm your host Tony Chop. Richard the professor is is on PTO today I believe. So you got me and you got Steve. Steve, how are you today? >> I'm doing great, Tony. You know, saw the consumer confidence the future purchase sentiment jumped up to record high. Yes. Yesterday. >> America's feeling good. >> Really? >> Yeah. Feeling good about that. So, turns out consumers are just holding. They're waiting. Well, you know, that's actually the perfect segue into our conversation today. Steve and I are are have been digging doing a bunch of digging into our favorite topic, one of our favorite topics, the ideas of attribution and measurement and the the time windows and how we measure and capture value and how that relates to our spend and AMR models and our spending power and all of it through the lens of this moment that's coming up Black Friday and Cyber Monday. So, Steve, I want to I want to get into some of the conversations that we've been having over the last several weeks around let's actually start on the topic measuring attribution, measuring the full value of the media investment. And I I'm going to start with the exploration that I've been doing around this idea of like how do I set my roest target today knowing that I have this big event coming up in in several weeks for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. So, we've been going through a bunch of accounts and and looking at the difference between 7-day click attribution, which is what we measure for for most of our accounts. There's it's the optima optimization setting that we use for for most of our accounts. and comparing that to the reported conversion value from a 28 day click window which is only available as a a reporting function in meta not not available as an optimization. So it it's been really interesting to me in this exploration because I'm seeing something that I can best describe as symmetry and I want to get your take on it Steve. So when we look at an account and we compare these two a 7-day click to 28 day click in in almost all the cases that I've looked at in most of the cases that I've looked at I see this relationship where approximately 80% maybe 85% of the total value capture is happening within that 7-day window and the remaining 15 or 20% give or take is happening in the day 8 between day 28 window and the symmetry here for me is in relationship to our incrementality testing. So, Steve, I'm curious if you're on the same page as me as thinking that what our incrementality testing is doing when we often find 120 or 115% incrementality from those geo holdout tests is sort of the inverse of what I'm talking about when we measure the value capture between seven and 28 day click as being 80 or 85%. What what do you think about this? Do you see do you see the same symmetry that I do or am I chasing ghosts? Yes, I think you have the right idea. I do think incrementality is catching that longer latency from the ad spend that you're talking about 8 to 28 day window that where we pick up an additional 20 15 20% that we're seeing on a somewhat regular basis between that 7-day click and the 28 day click. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's such an interesting thing. So, so now I've been approaching this looking at it in through this lens of the difference between seven and 28 day click and you and and then comparing that to incrementality. share a little bit about some of the way that you've been approaching this question around looking at the the daily spending power and potentially some of the overlaps that we're were coming across in our thinking there. >> Yeah. So, of course, we're concerned with coming up with daily forecast at CTC where we want to budget and see how we crack versus a brand on a daily basis. So it becomes really interesting to us to be able to create what should be spent in a day and what we can model spending in a day. So in order to kind of come up with a decent model for that basically what I thought is what if I took what we do on the monthly basis and get that even more granular going down to a daily basis. So, how much should I spend in a day and what can I expect in return in new customer revenue? Basically, a spending power or AME versus spend model on a daily basis. So, that can kind of give you what's going on by the day. But what it doesn't account for really as much is the latency that we're talking about. And that's kind of the one factor that we we need to include in considering such a granular approach to spending power is what happens from the money I spent today on November 12th further down the line like during a Black Friday and Cyber Monday. >> Yeah, it's such an interesting idea. So you're so the idea of getting to daily spending power. Correct me if I'm misunderstanding this in any way, but is around the thesis that potentially your brand has significantly more spending power on weekends or potentially there's significantly more spending power at I don't know what what are some of your other ideas for like why this would be different on a daily level? Well, I think some of it is obviously going to be around product drops or events, but some of it might also be related to holidays as well or to paychecks or to, you know, like the the Monday, two weeks before Mother's Day actually sees a kick up or something where we see an interesting gifting increase for a particular holiday or we have spring break coming up and we didn't understand that, oh, the Monday before spring break start beginning people start buying more swimsuits and then we'll s see it tick up with brands that are in that space. So we I think there's nuances here that we'll learn when we start looking at this that there's advantages that we can kind of in a way arbitrage opportunities for brands to spend more on certain days and then other days when makes sense to like hey pull back a little bit there there might not be that much available interest in your brand at that time. >> Yeah. Yeah. It's such an interesting idea. So, I'm going to I'm going to try to connect some dots here that I think are I think they're going to bridge these two worlds. So, I'm over here looking at the difference between 7-day click and 28 day click and what is that what is that gap? And fundamentally what what I'm seeking from that information is can I be more aggressive with my ROS targets? Can I can I deploy more media dollars because the value capture is going to happen later. incrementality testing that that gets us to a incrementality percentage that's over a 100% is effectively accomplishing the same thing. It's helping me understand that I can push my meta row targets down or any channel for that matter. I can push my rorowis targets down with confidence because the full value capture is going to be more than what's reported in the platform. Okay. And so as as I've been sorting out this idea for myself, I'm I'm what I'm recognizing is that I can't I can't combine these two ideas, right? I can't say for an account that we have that we're already running the meta meta target 20% lower because we've gotten an incrementality read. I can't go and then double add in this math from like looking at the difference between 7-day click and 28 day click because at that point I'm going to be effectively sort of double counting that that laden impact. So let's let's come back to this idea of like you're trying to look you're trying to get to daily spending power. How are you thinking about factoring in either the incrementality test that we already have for or this idea of latency between 7-day click and 28 day click? Like what what's on your mind for how we don't how how we don't go too far and and I'm I'm the guy here at CTC that's always trying to push the media spend as far as possible. So keep keep me honest. Yeah, I think that this is a really challenging question because what I'm concerned with necessarily is not necessarily what the media is going to report. So that 7 versus 28 day and I think you're right, a lot of that is captured through increment. There might be some kind of halo effect and friends telling friends or word of mouth basically or other kind of impacts from media spend that that that's incorporated into incrementality factors as well, not just the latency of the spend. I think there needs to be and we're going down this path with considering the latency on Facebook because that's kind of our primary channel that we spend a lot more on and it's also one of the best reporting channels. it it has pretty good data that I can rely on far more than some other channels. We're I'm really concerned with trying to find out the overall impact of it of spend not just in meta but in all other channels. So I'm also I also took a peek at like Google 30 and 60 and 90day windows and by that point in time you're you're pretty close. It's not that much more that you're gaining by going from 30 to 60 and 60 to 90. It's a few percentage points I was seeing for brands when I was kind of looking at that data going a little bit deeper in. So I I what I'd want to do in combination with all these is kind of come up with a decent curve for each brand of the latency of that consideration period. How much how far out does spend continue to impact you? And it might be indefinitely but probably a small percentage point after a certain amount of time where it's almost it could almost be ignored. Yeah, >> you and I were talking about this earlier this week and my my Steve and I Steve and I were drawing on the whiteboard and we drew drew a curve and the cut off line on 7-day click that curve capturing approximately 80% of the value and then the cut off line at 28 day capturing as far as the meta reporting is concerned earned 100% of the value, but we're wondering about that that tail of the curve. And and my point Steve was like, "What do you think the value of a click was in like 2017?" And I was like probably pretty close to zero. And you're like, "Well, I don't know." So I I >> for for me I just like speaking as an operator like the these questions of value capture and like how we connect to measurement are it's a it's a question of like how much fidelity is enough fidelity for me to go do what I need to do which is ultimately set a ROS target in meta and if I believe that 7day captures 80 or 85% of the value and 28 day captures 90 95% of the value. That's going to get me pretty darn close to what I need to do with my Meta Ross target. So, the the debate still ongoing here between Steve and I around what is what is the value of that that really long-term tail that that 30 to 60 day window and that 60 to 90day window. And I'm I'm at this point, Steve, I'm not yet I haven't yet been convinced by any data that it's large enough for any of the brands that we've looked at that it's it's going to be a big differentiating factor for how we fundamentally how we go and set the Roy target on Meta for today. But maybe you disagree. I think the accumulation of all that from previous periods has a small impact individually. But when you sum that up to me that almost represents what brand can be said as like oh they they have good brand it like heads up from all previous PR events you have done from all previous spend on all the media channels it's because it's a summation over like a decade maybe of ad spend and promotions. >> Yeah. So when you add it all up, all those percentage points from the past actually wind up being significant for a brand. >> Yeah. Yeah. That that's a super fair point. And I think, you know, we have we have several projects that we're we're working on right now that are that are involved in like expanding our scope of measurement to include upperfunnel and and brand activities. And I I think this is the this is a space that is I'm really excited about how we push our push our measurement like further like how we further measure impact. So by no means am I like am I like sort of out on like hey I don't I don't care about 60 value capture 90day value capture. I I I think that we we need to continue to press into how we understand this and connecting the dots between what is the value capture of a click 90 days after and how do we set our ROS target today specifically on on meta and how do we use Steve's daily spending power model to think about even more specifically how do we set our ROS target on meta for this coming Saturday. I think that the the different sort of the the the gap between those two ideas of super long-term value capture like really brand media investment like ad stack like how how much are we spending over over months or quarters all the way down to what does that mean for us to in in our meta ads account is like that's like prime CTC measuring philosophy. How do we connect these big ideas to these daily actions? That's a difficult problem to address because the the stuff further out the 90 days, the stuff beyond 28 and even the stuff beyond 7 days comes far more noisy and challenging to measure and challenging to put particular value on in terms of what you're getting in return. And when you need to hold every ad dollar accountable, there's a lot of noise that you're trying to hold accountable. >> Yeah, for sure. So, I want to I want to hit hit us with one more question here, one more idea. So, let's bring it back to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. What what if anything have you noticed from this exploration into daily spending power as it relates to this upcoming seasonal moment? Is there anything popping out of your early stage analysis that we could think about trying to incorporate into this this coming event? >> I think there's a a significant opportunity. Well, we saw with a few different brands that product drops or introductions or any sort of moments leading up before Black Friday and Cyber Monday stuff in earlier November can actually have a good holding pattern like it can increase your spending power and then kind of stay pretty high prior to Black Friday and Cyber Monday kind of keeps it basically increase baseline. That was kind of a wonderful thing to to see for the couple brands we looked at. The other thing is that within kind of that 7-day window, as you're getting within seven days of Black Friday, that spend is pretty conducive to creating conversions during them that special moment. So, yeah, Black Friday doesn't necessarily start now, but it definitely starts before it does in terms of media spend. >> Yeah, it Yeah, it's starting now for me. So I like >> I always think about like for me it's always an interesting like juxaposition between my own like anecdotal behavior in life and like how how I respond to advertising and >> as a person who does this professionally and and the juxiposition with the data science that that we do. I I have one example slide that I want to share that we did from our our monthly client meeting earlier earlier this month that I that I thought was really interesting. I'm going to talk us through this this slide and the analysis that we put together. The very top bar represents a standard distribution and I'm going to call it the baseline. The total value capture over a 28 day period. The darkest blue section of the graph is one day click. And the second one over represents 7-day click. And the vertical blue line represents this baseline. This 85% of the value captured within a 7-day click window. And the remaining 15% captured within a 28 day click window. So, what was super fascinating to me about this analysis is the the second chart, the bar second down from the top, which is the period pre- Black Friday last year. And what this is illustrating here is the value shift into 28-day click. So, notice the shrinking of the one-day click and the 7-day click and the expanding of the 28-day click attribution. And in this case, it's it's significant. It's 47% more of the value is captured over this 28 day click window versus normal. So this is this is the illustration of the longest lag happening pre- Black Friday. The other thing that really jumped out to me from this analysis was the bottom chart. So Cyber Monday actually represents the shortest lag between 7-day click and 28 day click. And if you think about it, it makes it makes perfect sense. The vast majority a large percentage of the conversions that you're going to capture from the advertising investment that you're making right now is going to happen through Black Friday and Cyber Monday and and after that the lag is going to go back to more of a a normal representation. So all of this is going to this idea around how aggressive can we be with our rorowest targets at this moment in time leading up to Black Friday. And my recommendation to everybody listening to this is to go and analyze the difference between your 7-day click and 28-day click attribution. establish a baseline for yourself, for your account, for how that behaves, and then go look at that behavior for for Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year to see if you can arrive at, hm, this period actually behaves quite a bit different. All in service of, hey, we have more spending power right now in this moment in time than we do at a normal period. While while Steve helps us refine these models and get them into our into our CTC lexicon, that's Tony's sort of first pass at how to go think about this for for your brand for this season. So, Steve, on the media side, we're looking at all of our meta ads accounts. We're looking at the difference between 7-day click and 28 day click. We're working to understand the the gap between those two and considering how that affects our ROS targets. At the same time, we have to consider if we're already operating with an incrementality test of 120% because that's going to be factoring in some of this as well. So, this is how we're working towards arriving at this this conclusion for what we do now today. My question to you is what is the what do you see as the next steps for this daily spend in AMR model and when can we hope to see some of this on our side? Oh, so I'm still working on the daily. I think starting in like Q1, well, we're already producing a few of them and kind of like using that a little bit as guidance. Also kind trying to get feedback on how to improve it. But the latency that you're talking about the difference between 1 and 7 and 28 and then on the Google side 30 60 90 kind of important things that I'm thinking about and trying to reconcile those versus the spend overall with that seeing that revenue in the future. So they're different data science things we're going to try to kind of get these models good on the daily basis but also including some latency effect. So it'll be the summation of all the latency that you had from previous spent and those are kind of included and cooked into the model. So you can consider what should I spend 50 days before Black Friday. 50 days before Oh boy, I can't wait. Well, even in this case where you're like more than a little more than two weeks from Black Friday. >> Yeah. I mean I think I think that is the I think that is the anchoring position that that I'm I'm really ultimately after. like we're asking and answering these questions in late October or early November, but yeah, to think about like how how our prospecting in September ultimately affects our Black Friday is like the holy grail. I think that's like, you know, would would be an an amazing thing to be able to understand more concretely. I'm really excited, Steve, to keep doing this work with you and I appreciate every time we get a chance to interact and think about how we tighten our data science and all all in service of the the principle the the the primary goal for CTC which is how do we create predictable profitable growth for our brands and for us that means getting really sharp about measurement. So any last thoughts Steve? >> Yeah that's it. It's getting sharper about measurement not just in the shorter window where it's easier to measure. It's like now let's take on the bigger challenge of looking at longer windows to measure and how effective our spend is in those longer. That's great. All right, here we go. How many days until Black Friday? 17. Yep. Go measure the difference between your 7-day click and 28 day click conversion value in your account. >> Yeah. Hopefully we see those future purchase conversions. Thanks everybody.
