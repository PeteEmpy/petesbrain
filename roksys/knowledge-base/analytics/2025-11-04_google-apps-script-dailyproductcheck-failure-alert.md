## Summary

- Google Apps Script 'Untitled project' experienced a server error on November 4, 2025
- The dailyProductCheck function failed during execution from 5:31 AM to 6:01 AM GMT (30-minute timeout)
- Error was a generic Google server error requiring retry, triggered by time-based automation
- Notification sent to petere@roksys.co.uk regarding the script failure

## Key Insights

- The 30-minute execution window suggests the script hit Google Apps Script's maximum execution time limit, indicating either inefficient code or excessive data processing
- A time-based trigger for 'dailyProductCheck' implies automated product inventory or feed monitoring - critical for e-commerce operations
- The generic server error message may mask underlying issues such as API rate limits, quota exhaustion, or memory constraints
- The 'Untitled project' naming suggests lack of proper project organization and documentation
