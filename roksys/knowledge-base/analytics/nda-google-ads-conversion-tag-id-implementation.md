## Summary

- Peter Empson provided the correct Google Ads conversion tag ID (AW-1069535771) for National Design Academy (NDA) website implementation
- Google Support clarified that NDA requires a separate Ads account and conversion ID from NMA (National Makeup Academy), which had been previously worked on
- NMA Enhanced Conversions for Leads is working correctly but requires resumed daily data uploads as none occurred in the last 7 days
- NDA implementation requires separate validation through account manager via a new support ticket
- Technical Solutions team confirmed proper setup process: Tools > Data manager > Google Tag > Manage to locate correct AW ID

## Key Insights

- Each website (NDA vs NMA) requires its own unique Google Ads conversion tag ID, even when managed by the same agency - proper account separation is critical
- Enhanced Conversions for Leads requires consistent daily data uploads to function properly; 7+ day gaps in uploads will trigger monitoring requirements
- When implementing conversion tracking across multiple client sites, validate tag IDs per account to avoid cross-contamination and tracking errors
- Google Support requires separate tickets per Ads account, so multi-property implementations need coordinated case management with account managers

Please use that AW ID for the NDA site and to validate that you would have to reach out to your account manager for a new case.

However, you will need to upload recent data as we can see that there has been no new uploads in the last 7 days to this conversion action "NMA Enhanced Conversions For Leads". Once you confirm that you have resumed daily uploads we will monitor it for 7 days.
