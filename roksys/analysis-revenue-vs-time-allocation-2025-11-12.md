## Key Findings (COMBINED Analysis - Tasks + Meetings)

### 🔴 CRITICAL IMBALANCES

**IMPORTANT**: Including meeting time (32 hours over 30 days) dramatically changes the analysis. The previous task-only analysis missed 63% of actual time allocation!

1. **Smythson - £2,400/month (17.5% revenue)**
   - **Combined allocation**: 35.4% time (+17.9% variance)
   - **Breakdown**: 4.5 hours tasks + 13.5 hours meetings = 18.0 hours total
   - **Issue**: Highest-revenue client receiving 2x more time than revenue justifies
   - **Note**: 8 meetings in 30 days (more than all other clients combined)
   - **Consideration**: May be justified due to complexity and strategic importance, but warrants monitoring

2. **Devonshire Hotels - £1,400/month (10.2% revenue)**
   - **Combined allocation**: 2.9% time (-7.3% variance)
   - **Breakdown**: 0 hours tasks + 1.5 hours meetings = 1.5 hours total
   - **Issue**: Second-highest revenue client critically under-allocated
   - **Note**: Recent October report flagged critical issues (zero conversions, PMax underperformance)
   - **Change from task-only**: Had 1 meeting which prevented "zero allocation" status, but still severely under-allocated
   - **Recommendation**: Create tasks immediately to address outstanding issues

3. **Bright Minds - £1,000/month (7.3% revenue)**
   - **Combined allocation**: 0.4% time (-6.9% variance)
   - **Breakdown**: 0.2 hours tasks + 0 hours meetings = 0.2 hours total
   - **Issue**: Fifth-highest revenue client with almost no time allocation
   - **Change from task-only**: No meetings at all, making under-allocation even more severe
   - **Recommendation**: Schedule meetings and create proactive tasks immediately

4. **Clear Prospects - £1,300/month (9.5% revenue)**
   - **Combined allocation**: 2.9% time (-6.6% variance)
   - **Breakdown**: 1.5 hours tasks + 0 hours meetings = 1.5 hours total
   - **Issue**: Third-highest revenue client significantly under-allocated
   - **Change from task-only**: Was "well-balanced" (7.9% tasks), but zero meetings reveals significant under-allocation
   - **Recommendation**: Schedule regular check-ins, create proactive optimization tasks

5. **Uno Lighting - £700/month (5.1% revenue)**
   - **Combined allocation**: 11.4% time (+6.3% variance)
   - **Breakdown**: 3.3 hours tasks + 2.5 hours meetings = 5.8 hours total
   - **Issue**: Still over-allocated but less severe than task-only analysis suggested
   - **Change from task-only**: Was +12.4% variance (3.4x), now +6.3% (2.2x)
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor, but may be justified by campaign complexity

### ⚖️ OVER-ALLOCATED CLIENTS (Combined Analysis)

**These clients receive disproportionately high time allocation relative to revenue:**

- **Smythson**: +17.9% variance (2.0x over-allocated) - 8 meetings in 30 days drove this
- **Uno Lighting**: +6.3% variance (2.2x over-allocated) - meetings + complex tasks
- **Tree2Mydoor**: +5.3% variance (1.8x over-allocated) - 3 meetings pushed into over-allocation

**Key Insights**:
- Meeting time is the primary driver of over-allocation
- Smythson's 8 meetings = more than all other clients combined except NDA
- **Go Glean**: NOW well-balanced! Was +8.4% (tasks only), but zero meetings means only +1.7% combined

**Action**:
- Smythson: Acceptable given strategic importance, but monitor meeting frequency
- Uno/Tree2Mydoor: Review if meeting frequency and task complexity match retainer value

### ⚠️ UNDER-ALLOCATED CLIENTS (Combined Analysis)

**Critical under-allocations (>5% variance):**

- **Bright Minds**: -6.9% variance (£1,000/month, 0.4% time) - NO MEETINGS
- **Clear Prospects**: -6.6% variance (£1,300/month, 2.9% time) - NO MEETINGS
- **Devonshire Hotels**: -7.3% variance (£1,400/month, 2.9% time) - NO TASKS, 1 meeting

**Moderate under-allocations (3-5% variance):**

- **Superspace**: -3.8% variance (£800/month, 2.0% time)
- **Positive Bakes**: -3.4% variance (£600/month, 1.0% time)
- **Just Bin Bags**: -3.4% variance (£600/month, 1.0% time)
- **Crowd Control**: -3.4% variance (£600/month, 1.0% time)
- **OTC Ltd**: -3.3% variance (£450/month, 0% time)

**Key Insight**: Zero meetings = major red flag. Three of top-6 revenue clients (Bright Minds, Clear Prospects, Devonshire) have had zero or one meeting in 30 days.

**Recommendation**: Schedule monthly check-ins with top-10 revenue clients at minimum

### ✅ WELL-BALANCED CLIENTS (Combined Analysis)

These clients have good alignment between revenue and time allocation (±2%):

- **Accessories for the Home**: +1.0% variance (was -4.9% tasks-only! 2 meetings fixed the balance)
- **National Design Academy**: +2.1% variance (3 meetings + tasks = well-balanced)
- **Go Glean**: +1.7% variance (was +8.4% tasks-only! Zero meetings brought it into balance)
- **Godshot**: -2.4% variance (acceptable)

**Key Insight**: Meeting time can dramatically shift balance - Accessories went from "significantly under-allocated" to "well-balanced" with just 2 meetings

## Recommended Actions (Based on Combined Analysis)

### CRITICAL (This Week) - Meeting Gaps

**The combined analysis reveals a critical pattern: Top revenue clients are not getting regular meeting touchpoints.**

1. **Schedule monthly meetings with top-3 revenue clients with zero recent meetings**:
   - **Bright Minds** (£1,000/month, 7.3% revenue) - NO MEETINGS in 30 days
   - **Clear Prospects** (£1,300/month, 9.5% revenue) - NO MEETINGS in 30 days
   - **Purpose**: Strategic check-ins, performance reviews, relationship building

2. **Create tasks for Devonshire Hotels** (£1,400/month, 10.2% revenue):
   - Had 1 meeting but ZERO active tasks
   - Address October report critical issues (zero conversions, PMax underperformance)
   - Follow up on issues raised in recent meeting

3. **Establish minimum meeting cadence**:
   - Top 5 revenue clients: Monthly minimum
   - Top 10 revenue clients: Quarterly minimum
   - **Rationale**: Meeting time = 63% of total time allocation. Without meetings, task-only allocation is blind to actual effort.

### Important (This Month) - Time Balance

4. **Review Smythson meeting frequency**:
   - 8 meetings in 30 days (36% of all client meetings)
   - Receiving 35.4% of time vs 17.5% of revenue (2x over-allocated)
   - **Action**: Acceptable given strategic importance, but ensure meetings are value-add (not check-ins that could be async)

5. **Increase task allocation for under-allocated clients**:
   - **Superspace**: £800/month (5.8% revenue), 2.0% time - needs proactive optimization tasks
   - **Positive Bakes, Just Bin Bags, Crowd Control**: Each £600/month (4.4% revenue), 1.0% time - schedule reviews
   - **OTC Ltd**: £450/month (3.3% revenue), 0% time - create baseline tasks

### Strategic (Ongoing)

6. **Run this combined analysis monthly**:
   - Update meeting time data (last 30 days rolling)
   - Update task allocation from Google Tasks
   - Track trends: Are meeting patterns shifting? Are task allocations balanced?
   - **Script location**: `/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain/shared/scripts/analyze_meeting_time.py`

7. **Consider retainer adjustments for persistently unbalanced clients**:
   - Monitor Smythson, Uno, Tree2Mydoor (over-allocated but potentially justified)
   - No action needed for Go Glean - combined analysis shows it's now balanced!

8. **Integrate meeting time into weekly summary email**:
   - Already integrated: `agents/reporting/kb-weekly-summary.py` includes resource allocation analysis
   - Weekly visibility into imbalances will prevent drift

## Methodology Notes

**Revenue Data**:
- Source: Spending Runway annual income spreadsheet (November 2025 column ONLY)
- URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XK0k528vaqtN0Qmg15iqzv5TLGv0UwlSaUV5W_Gyf1A/ (sheet: "inc")
- Devonshire entries combined (Main + Lismore + Weddings)
- Go Glean includes Grain Guard (combined client)
- Excluded clients with no November 2025 revenue (ended clients: X3 Ltd, Elite Competitions)
- Total active client revenue: £13,750/month

**Time Allocation Data**:

*Task Time*:
- Source: Google Tasks active tasks (as of 2025-11-12)
- Time estimates extracted from task titles/notes
- Default: 1 hour per task if no estimate provided
- Total: 18.9 hours across 27 tasks

*Meeting Time*:
- Source: Granola meeting imports in `clients/[client]/meeting-notes/` (last 30 days)
- Script: `/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain/shared/scripts/analyze_meeting_time.py`
- Duration estimation method:
  1. Check frontmatter metadata for explicit `duration` field (preferred)
  2. If not available, estimate from transcript word count using conservative bucketing:
     - >5000 words = 2.0 hours (very long meeting)
     - >3000 words = 1.5 hours (long meeting)
     - >1500 words = 1.0 hours (medium meeting)
     - >800 words = 0.75 hours (short meeting)
     - >300 words = 0.5 hours (very short meeting)
     - <300 words = 0.5 hours (default)
- Total: 32.0 hours across 22 meetings
- **Important**: Only counts transcript content AFTER frontmatter; does NOT search content for duration mentions (to avoid false matches like "12 to 24 hours" → "1224 hours")

*Combined*:
- Total combined hours: 50.9 hours (18.9 task + 32.0 meeting)
- **Meeting time = 63% of total time allocation** - this was completely missing from task-only analysis!
- **Limitation**: Neither measure captures actual time spent, only estimated/planned work

**Variance Calculation**:
- Variance = (Time % - Revenue %)
- Positive variance = over-allocated (more time than revenue justifies)
- Negative variance = under-allocated (less time than revenue justifies)

**Thresholds**:
- ✅ Well-balanced: ±2% variance
- ⚠️ Attention needed: ±2-5% variance
- 🔴 Critical imbalance: >±5% variance
