## **Microsoft launches AI days after OpenAI’s Atlas**

#### 🚨 **Our Report**  

**Microsoft has updated Edge's Copilot Mode with enhanced AI features** that can see and reason across open tabs, summarize information, fill out forms, and book hotels. The announcement came just two days after OpenAI revealed its competing Atlas AI browser, highlighting the intense competition between the tech giants.

#### 🔓 Key Points 

* The upgraded Edge includes "Actions" that **allow Copilot to complete tasks like hotel bookings** and filling, plus "Journeys" that trace connections between browsing sessions across multiple tabs.

* Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, wrote in the announcement post that the product serves as a "dynamic, intelligent companion" that **requires user permission to see** and analyze browsing data.

* The visual and functional similarities between Microsoft's Copilot Mode and OpenAI's Atlas are striking, with both featuring **clean interfaces and integrated AI assistants** that follow users as they browse.

#### 🔐 **Relevance** 

This back-to-back launch timing shows how quickly AI browser competition is accelerating between major players. For enterprise users, **the underlying AI models and workflow integration** will determine which platform delivers real productivity gains rather than interface design alone.

## How AI improved roadside response times 

* CAA Club Group, Canada’s largest not-for-profit auto club,** faced forecasting challenges across nearly 600 micro-regions**.

* Manual forecasting took a week per cycle and could not adapt to weather shifts or regional spikes, **causing** **delays and resource waste.**

* They implemented **Pecan AI's automated platform** to build 30+ predictive models that forecast volume by hour, region, and service type.

* With AI-driven forecasts, **response times improved** as vehicles were pre-positioned where demand was expected, increasing positive feedback.

* Anthropic has **expanded its partnership with Google to have up to 1M TPU chips**, providing over one gigawatt of computing capacity starting in 2026 to train future Claude models.

* This reflects **sustained chip demand across the AI industry**, as firms race to secure massive compute. OpenAI recently signed deals potentially costing over $1 trillion for 26 gigawatts of capacity.

* For Anthropic, the partnership **provides a more inexpensive alternative to supply-constrained Nvidia chips** while supporting its expected revenue growth of more than double next year.
