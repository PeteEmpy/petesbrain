Need to slow spend to avoid overselling before January stock arrives. WHAT: US Shopping/PMax campaigns (Shopping Branded, Shopping Brand Excluded, P Max Brand Excluded) target ROAS increased from 550% to 600%. US Demand Gen campaigns (main + retargeting) target CPA reduced to £60. EXPECTED: Higher ROAS target makes campaigns more conservative and slows spend, lower Demand Gen CPA throttles top-of-funnel traffic. Should increase overall account ROAS and reduce CPA while managing stock levels without killing all momentum. REVIEW: Monday Nov 25 - assess if stock management working and campaigns maintaining reasonable volume. SUCCESS: Spend slows enough to make stock last until new inventory arrives, maintain profitability, don't lose all sales momentum.

WHY: Email from Ant this morning - US stock will only last ~10 days. Cannot support Q4 volume scaling strategy without adequate inventory.

EXPECTED: Throttle spend to extend stock life, protect margins at 600% ROAS, prevent stock-out before new inventory arrives. Daily spend should reduce significantly.

REVIEW: Volatile situation - dependent on Ant's updates about new stock arrival. No fixed timeline.

SUCCESS: Stock doesn't run out before new inventory arrives. Maintain 600% ROAS while preserving stock. Smooth transition back to scaling when stock replenished.

SUPERSEDES: Complete abandonment of Q4 scaling strategy (progressive ROAS reduction 550% → 380%, aggressive budget scaling, Demand Gen expansion). Original plan assumed stock availability through December - assumption no longer valid.

AFFECTED: All campaigns (US, UK, Australia). Previous changes reversed: Nov 13 ROAS reduction to 495% now negated.
