## Scan shared drives and update client CONTEXT.md files
**Completed:** 2025-11-09 09:41  
**Source:** Peter's List  

Monthly on-demand scan of Google Drive "Shared with Me" to categorize and organize shared documents.

**Process:**
1. Tell Claude Code: "Scan shared drives and update files"
2. Claude will search Google Drive for shared documents
3. Files automatically categorized into THREE types:
   - **Client files** → Update client CONTEXT.md files
   - **Roksys/industry files** → Add to knowledge base inbox
   - **Personal files** → Flag for your review
4. Claude updates appropriate locations and reports findings

**What it tracks:**

**Client Resources:**
- Monthly reports and presentations
- Campaign briefs and strategy documents  
- Product data and supplemental feeds
- Client-maintained documentation

**Roksys Knowledge Base:**
- Google Ads platform updates and best practices
- Industry insights and research
- Marketing automation and AI strategies
- ROK methodologies and playbooks

**Personal Knowledge:**
- Your learning resources and training materials
- Personal notes and strategy ideas
- Books, courses, research

**Categorization Keywords:**
- Clients: Matched by client name/campaign prefix
- Roksys: "google ads", "ppc", "pmax", "roas", "ga4", "methodology", etc.
- Personal: "peter empson", "personal", "learning", "training", etc.

**Frequency:** Monthly (first week of month recommended)

This ensures client CONTEXT.md files stay current AND your knowledge base grows automatically from shared resources.

## P0: Fix Google Tasks Bloat - "Peter's List" Exceeds 25K Token Limit
**Completed:** 2025-11-19 11:06
**Source:** Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**Status:** Critical system issue resolved via external cleanup process.

**The Problem:**
- "Peter's List" exceeded 25,000 token limit (reached 25,158 tokens)
- MCP tools unable to load task list
- Daily briefing functionality at risk
- Hundreds of old/completed/duplicate tasks accumulated
- Verbose AI-generated task notes bloating data
- No archival or cleanup process in place

**Impact:**
- Daily briefing could fail
- Cannot view/manage tasks via Claude Code
- Task creation working but results invisible
- Problem would exponentially worsen over time

**Resolution:**
Google Tasks bloat issue resolved by fundamentally re-architecting the task management system. The 25K token limit problem has been eliminated through a new design that doesn't rely on a monolithic Google Tasks list.

**What Was Done:**
- **System Re-specification:** Task management system redesigned
- **Per-Client Architecture:** Tasks now stored in per-client `tasks.json` files instead of single Google Tasks list
- **Eliminated Bottleneck:** No single list can exceed token limits
- **Google Tasks Reserved:** "Peter's List" now used only for personal tasks
- **Client Tasks:** Stored locally in `clients/{client}/tasks.json` files
- **Scalable Design:** System can now handle unlimited client tasks without token issues

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `shared/client_tasks_service.py` for unified task management
- Each client has own `tasks.json` file in their directory
- Supports parent/child task hierarchy for projects
- Task queries can filter by client, priority, status
- Documentation in `docs/INTERNAL-TASK-SYSTEM.md`

**Context:**
- Original issue identified: 2025-11-17
- MCP error: "list_tasks response (25158 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000)"
- Affected list ID: MTY1OTUzNzc4MjgxMDM5NTQwMDY6MDow (Peter's List)
- Priority: P0 (Critical System Issue)
- Due date: 2025-11-18

**Proposed Solutions (for future reference):**
1. Immediate manual cleanup (delete completed, archive old tasks)
2. Project structure implementation (parent/child task hierarchy)
3. Automated task hygiene agent (weekly cleanup of old/completed tasks)

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor token count to prevent recurrence
- Consider implementing automated cleanup agent
- Establish ongoing task hygiene rules
- Review task creation patterns to reduce verbosity

## Roksys Blog: Clean Up "Recent Posts" Sidebar Widget
**Completed:** 2025-11-20 12:10
**Source:** Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**Issue:** "Recent Posts" sidebar widget on roksys.co.uk blog was displaying 3 lines per post (title, date, excerpt), making it messy and hard to read.

**Solution:** Added custom CSS to WordPress Additional CSS + enabled "Display post date" in block settings to create a clean, single-line format with inline dates.

**Technical Details:**
- Blog uses Gutenberg "Latest Posts" block (`.wp-block-latest-posts`), not classic widget
- Initial CSS targeted wrong classes (`.widget_recent_entries`) - corrected after inspecting HTML
- Final CSS targets: `.wp-block-latest-posts`, `.wp-block-latest-posts__post-title`, `.wp-block-latest-posts__post-date`
- Widget settings: Enabled "Display post date" via Appearance → Widgets → Default Sidebar → Recent Posts block

**Changes Applied:**
1. Used flexbox layout to put title and date on same line (`display: flex; justify-content: space-between`)
2. Made dates inline at end of line, right-aligned, 11px, light grey (#999)
3. Added separator lines between posts (1px #e0e0e0 borders)
4. Added Roksys green (#6CC24A) hover effect on post titles
5. Hidden excerpts completely
6. Set post titles to 13px font size with 1.4 line-height
7. Each post now displays as single line: "Article Title........................ Nov 19, 2025"

**Implementation:**
- Location: WordPress Admin → Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS
- Block setting: WordPress Admin → Appearance → Widgets → Default Sidebar → Recent Posts → "Display post date" enabled
- CSS file stored: `roksys/documents/wordpress-recent-posts-css-CORRECT.css`
- Guide document: `roksys/documents/wordpress-recent-posts-cleanup-guide.md`

**Result:** Recent Posts sidebar is now much cleaner, more compact, and easier to scan. Posts reduced from 3 lines (title, date, excerpt) to 1 line (title + inline date). Professional appearance with dates right-aligned at the end of each line.

**Files Created:**
- `/roksys/documents/wordpress-recent-posts-css.css` (initial version - wrong selectors)
- `/roksys/documents/wordpress-recent-posts-css-CORRECT.css` (final version with flexbox inline dates)
- `/roksys/documents/wordpress-recent-posts-cleanup-guide.md` (implementation guide)

**Before/After:**
- Before: 3 lines per post (messy, hard to scan)
- After: 1 line per post with date right-aligned (clean, professional)

## Infrastructure: Fix ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Auth Conflict (Cost: $25)
**Completed:** 2025-11-20 15:30
**Source:** Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**Issue:** ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was set globally in `~/.bashrc`, causing Claude Code interactive sessions to use API billing instead of the claude.ai token. This resulted in unexpected charges of **$25 today** for what should have been free/included usage.

**Root Cause:**
- `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."` was present in `~/.bashrc`
- Origin unknown (not intentionally added)
- Claude Code prioritised API key over claude.ai token for authentication
- All interactive Claude Code work today was billed to API account instead of claude.ai subscription
- Warning visible in Claude Code: "⚠Auth conflict: Both a token (claude.ai) and an API key (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) are set"

**Cost Impact:**
- **$25 charged today** for interactive sessions that should have used claude.ai token
- Background agents (daily-intel-report, ai-inbox-processor, etc.) are supposed to use API key explicitly
- Interactive work (ad-hoc analysis, client work, conversations) should use claude.ai token (included in subscription)

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Removed `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` line from `~/.bashrc`
2. Unset in current session (requires Claude Code restart to fully apply)
3. Background agents still work - they explicitly set API key in their LaunchAgent plist files

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/administrator/.bashrc` - Removed ANTHROPIC_API_KEY export

**Prevention:**
- Monitor Anthropic API usage dashboard for unexpected spikes
- Verify auth method on Claude Code startup (should only see claude.ai, not API key)
- Document that API key should ONLY be set in agent-specific LaunchAgent plists, never in shell profile
- Keep API key confined to background automation, not interactive sessions

**Authentication Architecture (Correct Setup):**
- **Interactive Claude Code:** Uses claude.ai token (included in subscription)
- **Background Agents:** Use ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set in LaunchAgent plist `EnvironmentVariables`
- **Shell Profile:** Should NOT have ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set globally

**Lesson:** Global environment variables in shell profiles can cause expensive authentication routing issues. Keep API credentials scoped to specific processes.
