## SECTION 1: Hero Headline
**Location:** Top section with background image

### CURRENT:
> Looking for someone who's passionate about paid search? Who understands your PPC accounts? And who actually cares about your business?

### NEW:
> Looking for someone who's passionate about paid search? Who understands your PPC accounts? And who actually cares about your business?

**[KEEP THE SAME]**

## SECTION 2: Opening Paragraph
**Location:** Below headline

### CURRENT:
> Look no further. With me and Rok Systems, that's exactly what you get. Someone who's lived and breathed paid search and digital marketing for over twenty years. Someone who knows exactly how to grow your revenue through effective pay-per-click marketing. And someone who genuinely wants to help you succeed. But you don't just get someone like me. You get me.

### NEW:
> Look no further. With me and Rok Systems, that's exactly what you get. Someone who's lived and breathed paid search and digital marketing for over twenty-five years. Someone who knows exactly how to grow your revenue through effective pay-per-click marketing. And someone who genuinely wants to help you succeed. But you don't just get someone like me. **You get me.**
>
> And here's what makes that different in 2025: while you're getting the same personal service and business expertise you'd expect, I'm now backed by AI-powered systems that help me deliver better results than ever before.

**[Changed "twenty" to "twenty-five" years, added one new paragraph at end]**

## SECTION 3: Paid search management with a personal difference
**Location:** Main content section

### HEADING - KEEP THE SAME:
> Paid search management with a personal difference

### BODY TEXT - KEEP THE SAME:
> When your business works with Rok Systems, you'll be working with me. Peter Empson. I help businesses like yours make money. I get to know you and your goals. I understand your strategy and your products. And I get in the trenches doing the work that counts.
>
> Too many PPC agencies bring in a dedicated pitching team only for you to find you're dealing with a different junior account manager every time you get in touch. That doesn't bring the attention and commitment you need to get effective PPC results. Or perhaps you're relying on an internal marketing manager to look after your paid search strategy, as well as overseeing a dozen other tasks? With their mind in so many places, they don't have the time or expertise to focus on all the little details that make a big difference.

**[NO CHANGES TO THIS SECTION]**

## SECTION 4: NEW SECTION TO ADD (Optional)
**Location:** After "personal difference" section, before bullet points

### NEW HEADING:
> Personal service, amplified by AI

### NEW BODY TEXT:
> Here's where things get interesting. While other agencies are just starting to talk about AI, I've spent the last year building something real: an AI-powered infrastructure that helps me deliver better results for every client.
>
> What does that actually mean for you?
>
> - **Automated monitoring** that spots performance anomalies before they cost you money - not days later when you're reviewing a report, but in real-time
> - **Institutional memory** that tracks every experiment, every change, and every outcome across all my clients - so when something works, we know why, and we can apply those learnings to your account
> - **AI-powered analysis** that cross-references your performance against platform updates, seasonal patterns, competitor activity, and product-level changes to explain exactly what's driving results
> - **Evidence-based recommendations** backed by data from hundreds of successful tests - not guesswork or gut feel
>
> The result? You still get me, my expertise, and my personal attention. But now I'm backed by systems that help me spot opportunities and catch issues faster than any human could alone.

**[THIS IS A NEW SECTION - Add a new Elementor block if you want to include it]**
