## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Pause Zero-Conversion Assets**
   - "Luxury Yorkshire Dales Retreat" - £152 wasted
   - "4 Star Luxury In Derbyshire" - £178 wasted
   - "Charming Country House Hotel" - £131 wasted
   - Total potential monthly savings: ~£461

2. **Replace Inefficient Business Name**
   - "The Devonshire Fell" has £1,074.90 cost/conv
   - Consider using more specific property USPs instead

3. **Test Replacement Assets**
   - Replace generic "luxury" and "charming" language
   - Use specific differentiators like "AA Hotel of the Year 2025" (performed well for Cavendish)
   - Emphasise location-specific benefits (Chatsworth, Bolton Abbey)

### Asset Copy Patterns That Work

✅ **Performing Well:**
- Awards/recognition ("The Times Hotel of the Year", "AA Hotel of the Year 2025")
- Specific offerings ("Art-filled Hotel", "Award-winning restaurant")
- Location benefits ("Stay on The Chatsworth Estate", "Inn on the Chatsworth Estate")

❌ **Not Working:**
- Generic luxury descriptors ("Luxury Yorkshire Dales Retreat")
- Vague quality claims ("Charming Country House Hotel")
- Generic room descriptions ("40 Unique Charming Rooms")

### Next Steps

1. Generate replacement text for the 7 underperforming assets
2. Create A/B test plan for new vs old assets
3. Monitor performance over next 30 days
4. Review asset group distribution (Cavendish Hotel has most top performers)
