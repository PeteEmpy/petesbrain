**Completed:** 2025-11-09 09:41  
**Source:** Peter's List  

Monthly on-demand scan of Google Drive "Shared with Me" to categorize and organize shared documents.

**Process:**
1. Tell Claude Code: "Scan shared drives and update files"
2. Claude will search Google Drive for shared documents
3. Files automatically categorized into THREE types:
   - **Client files** → Update client CONTEXT.md files
   - **Roksys/industry files** → Add to knowledge base inbox
   - **Personal files** → Flag for your review
4. Claude updates appropriate locations and reports findings

**What it tracks:**

**Client Resources:**
- Monthly reports and presentations
- Campaign briefs and strategy documents  
- Product data and supplemental feeds
- Client-maintained documentation

**Roksys Knowledge Base:**
- Google Ads platform updates and best practices
- Industry insights and research
- Marketing automation and AI strategies
- ROK methodologies and playbooks

**Personal Knowledge:**
- Your learning resources and training materials
- Personal notes and strategy ideas
- Books, courses, research

**Categorization Keywords:**
- Clients: Matched by client name/campaign prefix
- Roksys: "google ads", "ppc", "pmax", "roas", "ga4", "methodology", etc.
- Personal: "peter empson", "personal", "learning", "training", etc.

**Frequency:** Monthly (first week of month recommended)

This ensures client CONTEXT.md files stay current AND your knowledge base grows automatically from shared resources.
