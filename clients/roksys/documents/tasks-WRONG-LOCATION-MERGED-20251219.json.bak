This is a system monitoring task for internal Roksys work.\n\n**Objective**: Monitor and verify that the file compression prevention system is working correctly.\n\n**Background**:\nOn 4th December 2025, we fixed a critical system issue where macOS was automatically compressing JSON state/cache files and log files, causing \"OSError [Errno 11]: Resource deadlock avoided\" errors in multiple LaunchAgents.\n\n**What Was Implemented**:\n1. **Automated Decompression Script**: `shared/scripts/decompress-state-files.py`\n   - Decompresses files in data/state, data/cache, and log files\n   - Runs hourly via LaunchAgent\n\n2. **File \"Touch\" Script**: `shared/scripts/prevent-file-compression.sh`\n   - Touches all JSON files to keep them \"hot\" (recently accessed)\n   - Prevents macOS from marking them for compression\n   - Runs hourly via LaunchAgent\n\n3. **LaunchAgent**: `com.petesbrain.prevent-compression.plist`\n   - Runs both scripts every hour (3600 seconds)\n   - Logs to: `~/.petesbrain-prevent-compression.log`\n\n**Monitoring Commands** (run these in January):\n\n```bash\n# 1. Check LaunchAgent is running\nlaunchctl list | grep prevent-compression\n# Expected: Should show PID and exit code 0\n\n# 2. Check recent decompression activity\ntail -50 ~/.petesbrain-prevent-compression.log\n# Expected: Recent timestamps, \"Decompressed: 0 file(s)\" (if working correctly)\n\n# 3. Check for compressed files (should be NONE)\nls -lO ~/Documents/PetesBrain/data/state/*.json | grep compressed\nls -lO ~/Documents/PetesBrain/data/cache/*.log | grep compressed\nls -lO ~/Documents/PetesBrain/tools/product-impact-analyzer/data/product_baselines/*.json | grep compressed\n# Expected: No output (no compressed files)\n\n# 4. Check agent health (should be no deadlock errors)\npython3 ~/Documents/PetesBrain/agents/health-check/health-check.py --no-alerts\n# Expected: 64+/69 agents healthy, no deadlock errors\n\n# 5.

Check LaunchAgent is loaded: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.petesbrain.prevent-compression.plist`\n2. Check scripts are executable: `ls -la ~/Documents/PetesBrain/shared/scripts/{prevent-file-compression.sh,decompress-state-files.py}`\n3. Manually decompress: `python3 ~/Documents/PetesBrain/shared/scripts/decompress-state-files.py`\n4. Review error log: `tail -100 ~/.petesbrain-prevent-compression-error.log`\n\n**Files to Monitor**:\n- `/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain/data/state/*.json` (45 files)\n- `/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain/data/cache/*` (85 files)\n- `/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain/tools/product-impact-analyzer/data/product_baselines/*.json` (product baseline files)\n- `~/.petesbrain*.log` (agent logs)\n\n**Why This Matters**:\nThis issue caused 4 critical agents to fail and 24 agents to be unloaded. Without monitoring, compression could silently return and break automation again.\n\n**Original Incident**: 4th December 2025\n**Root Cause**: macOS file compression on infrequently-accessed files\n**Fix Applied**: Dual prevention (touch + decompress) + hourly LaunchAgent\n**Next Check**: 15th January 2026",
