### Product Feed Issue - Sensor Bulkhead Pricing (May 2025)

**[01/05/2025, 07:49:21]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[02/05/2025, 11:53:04]** Dana: Hi Peter, sorry for the late response. This item we sell it at a premium price at the moment so we not offer the variants qty yet 😁.

**[02/05/2025, 11:53:37]** Dana: [image omitted]

**[02/05/2025, 11:54:02]** Dana: [image omitted]

**[02/05/2025, 11:54:33]** Dana: Is there anyway we can adjust on Google for the correct qty price? The ads show 5pc but on 2pcs price

**[02/05/2025, 12:00:04]** Peter Empson: Sorry, my fault - fixed

**[02/05/2025, 12:00:37]** Peter Empson: It may take a couple of hours for Google to update. I optimised the title and put the wrong pack size in

**[02/05/2025, 12:12:49]** Dana: Thank you very much

**[12/05/2025, 11:05:44]** Dana: Hi Peter, hope you are well. Unfortunately our sensor bulkhead still shows the incorrect price with the quantity on google, would you able to correct that please? Thank you very much

**[12/05/2025, 11:15:57]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana so its the 10 pack this time. Sorry about that will fix now

**[12/05/2025, 11:19:28]** Peter Empson: All fixed and I've double checked the other combinations as well - apologies

### Budget Increase Proposal (12 May 2025)

**[12/05/2025, 11:22:08]** Peter Empson: Sales are increasing and the main campaign is limited by budget. The daily budget is £300 but it could spend up to £540. Overall ROAS was 390% for the last 30 days so the campaigns are efficient. What are your thoughts on increasing the budget to £400 on that campaign?

**[12/05/2025, 11:27:15]** Dana: Thank you Peter. let me have a discussion with Richard regarding the budget and let you know soon

**[13/05/2025, 17:37:31]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[14/05/2025, 07:24:58]** Dana: Thank you

**[14/05/2025, 07:30:01]** Peter Empson: Morning Dana, any thoughts on the budget?

**[14/05/2025, 14:46:49]** Dana: Hi Peter, after our discussion, it seems best to wait 1-2 months as we are building up stock from China since the Uno orders have increased. Shall we review this again toward the end of June?

**[14/05/2025, 14:53:33]** Peter Empson: No problem, it's completely up to you. The good thing is that there is potential to grow, the only downside is that the bid startegies are not working to their full potential

**[14/05/2025, 16:48:06]** Dana: What is your suggestion to make it work to their full potential?

**[14/05/2025, 17:27:33]** Peter Empson: I would always suggest that your campaigns with the best conversions and ROAS get pushed as far as they can, at the end of the day they are making you money. The main P Max campaign is on £300/day at the moment but Google thinks it van bring more conversions at the same ROAS if we increase the budget to £520, another £220/day. I would suggest doing it in stages like last time and going to £400 gradually and then seeing how it performs and whether we want to go higher

### Product Image Disapproval Issue (16 May 2025)

**[16/05/2025, 12:28:12]** Dana: Hi Peter, I found this products doesn't show on Google these few days. On Google does it show in 1pc, 2pcs and 5pcs price now?

**[16/05/2025, 12:28:43]** Dana: I lower the price a bit too

**[16/05/2025, 13:22:38]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, there is a problem with the image in the product that I am working on. Google doesn't like the 3 blue lines on the product image so I am just getting rid of them. The price decrease will be beneficial

**[16/05/2025, 13:25:46]** Peter Empson: I asked for a review of it a couple odf days ago but Google re still complaining about it

**[16/05/2025, 13:25:55]** Peter Empson: The other versions are fine

**[16/05/2025, 13:31:00]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[16/05/2025, 14:50:57]** Dana: Oh I see

**[16/05/2025, 14:51:28]** Dana: Should I use another image (without the blue line )now?

**[16/05/2025, 14:51:41]** Peter Empson: All done and its live

**[16/05/2025, 14:51:50]** Peter Empson: I changed the image in Merchant Cebtre

**[16/05/2025, 14:52:09]** Peter Empson: I'm just trying to develop something that alerts me when a product has been disapproved

**[16/05/2025, 14:52:31]** Dana: Oh great, thank you. Is the qty correct too? 1pc, 2pcs, 5pcs?

**[16/05/2025, 14:53:16]** Peter Empson: YEs

**[16/05/2025, 14:53:33]** Peter Empson: You can see on that screenshot above

**[16/05/2025, 14:54:09]** Dana: Perfect, thank you so much

**[16/05/2025, 14:54:59]** Peter Empson: No problem, its annoying that the only way to see whtehr products have been disapproved is to go into Merchant Centre and look for them

**[16/05/2025, 14:55:13]** Peter Empson: … or wait until you see them 🙂

**[16/05/2025, 14:55:33]** Dana: We learnt that now, thank you ☺️

**[19/05/2025, 12:06:52]** Dana: Hi Peter, Hope you're doing well. This product is one of our top sellers. I added a variant on Friday, but I just discovered that Google isn't displaying it in the ads anymore, and it's also missing in the Merchant Centre. I deleted the variant about 10 minutes ago. Will the product reappear in the ads as before in a few hours?

**[19/05/2025, 12:07:02]** Dana: what is your advise to add the drop down selection on the product page and that not lose the sale?

**[19/05/2025, 12:59:55]** Peter Empson: If you are changing a product create the new variant and set it live, keep the same SKU for both.

**[19/05/2025, 13:15:42]** Peter Empson: No, you just need to keep the same SKU for the old and new versions

**[19/05/2025, 13:19:49]** Peter Empson: Only thisis live at the moment - https://uno-lighting.com/products/gu10-garden-outdoor-spike-lights-ip65?variant=55212778422649

**[19/05/2025, 13:44:49]** Dana: So the red sku, should I use the UNO-CLEO-GU101?

**[19/05/2025, 13:45:47]** Dana: The new variant items pricing will be different

**[19/05/2025, 13:46:29]** Peter Empson: What I need to know is what was the original product that you have replaced, is it this product just with variants or have you created something completely new?

**[19/05/2025, 13:46:47]** Dana: [This message was deleted]

**[19/05/2025, 13:55:52]** Peter Empson: The original SKU for both of these was CLEO-WIFI-GU10, is that correct?

**[19/05/2025, 13:59:19]** Dana: Excellent, no problem at all. thank you very much

**[19/05/2025, 14:01:23]** Peter Empson: Just ensure that those SKUs are set caccordingly for that new product

**[19/05/2025, 14:33:14]** Dana: The first link is correct. The 2nd links one is different type of product

**[19/05/2025, 14:33:14]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[19/05/2025, 14:33:38]** Peter Empson: OK, so what I have just sent in that screenshot is not the same product?

**[19/05/2025, 14:34:04]** Dana: Correct, not the same product. (Not the same family)

**[19/05/2025, 14:34:12]** Peter Empson: Gotcha

**[19/05/2025, 14:34:56]** Peter Empson: The product you've sent over has not had many sales via Google Ads, it may have sold well but not via the ads

**[19/05/2025, 14:35:21]** Peter Empson: The product If just screenshotted is the best seller on Google Ads, all three variants

**[19/05/2025, 14:39:22]** Dana: https://uno-lighting.com/collections/gu10-intergrated-led-spike-light/products/gu10-garden-outdoor-spike-lights-ip65?variant=55220239106425   This one is bestselling on single fitting. But customers been asking if we have sell the GU10 lamps option, so it should increase some sale if we create the drop down option

**[19/05/2025, 14:43:46]** Peter Empson: OK, no sales via the Google shopping ad for that product in the last 30 days. It may be that they ar ecoming in on a different shopping ad and buying the product

**[19/05/2025, 14:49:40]** Dana: [image omitted]

**[19/05/2025, 15:10:10]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[19/05/2025, 15:11:44]** Peter Empson: For some reason the rporting system sees the product but Google Ads is not seeing it

**[19/05/2025, 15:12:33]** Peter Empson: I wonder if its because it has been moved? Unfortunately in the reporting software I can display the SKU or the URL otherwise we would be able to see

**[19/05/2025, 15:13:37]** Peter Empson: The new mapping is complete and the feed has been run

**[19/05/2025, 15:13:46]** Dana: Oh no I hope that won't wipe out the sales record for Google

**[19/05/2025, 15:14:12]** Peter Empson: I don'yt know ye, we'll have to see hwo it comes through

**[19/05/2025, 15:14:35]** Peter Empson: I will cerate a new shopping campaign that just promotes these products so that they get a push

**[19/05/2025, 15:18:10]** Peter Empson: I think in th efuture it would be best to map out these changes beforehand

**[19/05/2025, 15:30:44]** Dana: Sure I will let you know before I will do anything going forward

**[19/05/2025, 15:31:52]** Peter Empson: If I know before hand I can log the necessary SKUs and product Ids and then give advice on the new setup

### Image Update Request - Banbury Downlights (13 June 2025)

**[13/06/2025, 11:06:35]** Dana: Good morning Peter, I hope you're doing well. I've noticed that this product has been moving more slowly recently, likely due to increased competition and the similarity of our product images to others on the market. To address this, we've updated the main product images to make them more distinctive for Google Ads. However, it seems the new images have not yet been reflected on Google. Could you please advise if any changes need to be made directly within the Google Merchant Center to trigger the update? Here are the product links for reference: Product link 1: https://uno-lighting.com/collections/downlights/products/banbury-gu10-trimless-fire-rated-ip65-fixed-downlight-gu10-socket

**[13/06/2025, 12:05:48]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, I'll take a look

**[13/06/2025, 12:18:47]** Dana: Thank you

**[13/06/2025, 12:55:06]** Peter Empson: When did you change the images? I've just rerun the feed now and the new images have been pulled in, they will show in the ads in the next couple of hours. The feed is only updated once per day at around 2 in the morning

**[13/06/2025, 14:25:41]** Dana: Oh great, I updated yesterday morning

**[13/06/2025, 16:42:06]** Peter Empson: I can confirm that the new image is now being used

**[13/06/2025, 18:05:57]** Dana: Thank you so much

### Price Increase Discussion Scheduling (18 June 2025)

**[18/06/2025, 15:30:36]** Dana: Hi Peter, hope you enjoyed the weather. Can we have phone conversation tomorrow around 2pm regarding the price increase?

**[18/06/2025, 15:38:49]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, I'm trying to make the most of it whilst its still here but failing miserably!

I can't do 2pm but I can do 1pm, is that OK?

**[18/06/2025, 15:40:10]** Peter Empson: or 12

**[18/06/2025, 17:42:22]** Richard: I can do 10? Or Friday 2pm would be fine

**[18/06/2025, 18:17:24]** Peter Empson: I think it would be safer to do 2pm on Friday, I have an appointment tomorrow and could be back for 10 but not 100%

**[18/06/2025, 21:30:30]** Richard: Ok great, Friday at 2pm

**[18/06/2025, 21:42:11]** Peter Empson: Do you want ring me or do you want a Google Meet?

**[18/06/2025, 22:20:15]** Richard: Phone. All is fine

**[20/06/2025, 13:55:22]** Dana: Hi Peter, we are running little bit late, will be back around 15 mins, so sorry

### Bestseller Product Warning (30 June 2025)

**[30/06/2025, 14:50:18]** Peter Empson: FYI

As you know the LED trimless profile is your best selling product on Google Ads. Please note that the best selling version of this is this one:-

https://uno-lighting.com/products/5-pack-of-2-meters-trimless-12mm-wide-plaster-in-aluminum-led-profile-channel-with-frosted-diffuser-accessories-for-led-strip-lighting-total-4-meters-copy?variant=54895764701561

https://uno-lighting.com/products/2-meters-trimless-12mm-aluminum-profile-channel-with-frosted-diffuser-and-accessories-for-led-strip-lighting?variant=54897613898105

The best seller is the old version before the change over to being able to select quantities on the product page which is the second version.

I'm telling you this just in case you ever decided to remove the old version, please don't!

### Delivery Lead Time Variant Discussion (28 July 2025)

**[28/07/2025, 07:02:27]** Dana: Good morning, Peter! We were wondering if including delivery lead time information in this section would impact Google. We usually mention it in the description, but it seems that most customers don't notice it. We're thinking that placing it under the option might make it more visible. What are your thoughts?

**[28/07/2025, 07:02:45]** Dana: [image attached: 00000032-PHOTO-2025-07-28-07-02-45.jpg]

**[28/07/2025, 07:02:45]** Dana: [image attached: 00000033-PHOTO-2025-07-28-07-02-45.jpg]

**[28/07/2025, 08:36:59]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, I would strongly recommend that you don't do this.
1. The variant field is to describe the physical options for a product not to convey delivery messages.
2. The message is a visual barrier to purchase and would adversely affect conversion rate
3. There are other places best suited for this message, ideally post purchase on the order summary screen or in the order confirmation email

It would be far better to have accepted the order and then clearly convey the message than to stop people in the first place. I appreciate that this may be causing you customer service issues but that is easier to deal with than not get the order in the first place.

**[28/07/2025, 09:05:08]** Dana: Noted, thank you very much Peter

### Product Hero Case Study Request (11 August 2025)

**[11/08/2025, 14:32:52]** Peter Empson: Hi, I've just been contacted by Product Hero. They would like to do a case study on your account. It wouldn't need any input from yourselves apart from your approval at the end before they actually publish it live. If you don't like what they write, then they won't publish it.

**[13/08/2025, 09:08:51]** Peter Empson: Hi what did you think about the case study?

Any idea when the IP65 walkover profile will be back in stock again?

**[13/08/2025, 09:11:06]** UNO Google: You changed this group's icon

**[13/08/2025, 09:28:36]** Dana: Hi Peter, the case study should be fine for us

**[13/08/2025, 09:29:48]** Dana: We got the IP65 profiles back to stock now, but we no longer offer in 1 Metre. Only 2 Metres, so we left the 1 metre stock as 0

**[13/08/2025, 09:30:48]** Peter Empson: OK, thats a shame as it was a best seller

**[13/08/2025, 09:31:03]** Peter Empson: Good news on the case study, thank you. I'll let them know, and I'll send over a copy of it as soon as I get it

**[13/08/2025, 09:33:34]** Dana: No problem

### Invalid GTINs Issue (17-18 September 2025)

**[17/09/2025, 14:28:44]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana. I've just sent you an email regarding some invalid GTINs. Could you take a look at it as soon as possible please?

**[17/09/2025, 16:54:04]** Dana: Yes will do

**[18/09/2025, 15:09:09]** Dana: Just amend it now Peter, could you check if Google runs those products again

**[18/09/2025, 15:43:46]** Peter Empson: They are now updated in Google Merchant Centre. It could take Google a little while to double-check them, but I'll keep an eye on it

**[18/09/2025, 16:15:13]** Dana: Thank you ☺️

### Seasonal Budget Increase Discussion (25 September 2025)

**[25/09/2025, 11:55:09]** Richard: Hi Peter, I'm wondering if you think it's a good idea to increase our budget for the next couple of months? October and November are usually our busiest months. I'm hoping a budget might helps maximum potential sales, any thoughts?

**[25/09/2025, 12:02:27]** Peter Empson: Hi, Richard. I've been making some changes to your account this morning with this in mind as I can see from last year that we will be seeing some sort of seasonal uplift over the next couple of months. There is only one campaign in your account at the moment which is limited by budget. That's the Villains campaign, which contains the products that don't convert at the ROAS which we have set. If I were to increase budget at the moment, nothing would happen as we're already spending the daily amount. The way to increase traffic and visibility is by dropping our expected target ROAS. This is currently set at 230. If I were to drop that to 200, this would increase the amount of traffic that you get through to the website. It doesn't necessarily mean that your overall ROAS would go down, but there is always the danger that it will. For the last 30 days, your Google ROAS has been 226%. But that filters through to be a 482% ROAS overall when you take into consideration all the sales. I think it would be a good idea to decrease the ROAS to maximise on this seasonal trend which should ramp up over the next couple of months. And then we'll get the drop off in December where I can increase the ROAS targets again

**[25/09/2025, 12:04:17]** Peter Empson: One thing I've been trying to do in the Google Ads account is to break out the products into logical groups. Second, target specific groupings of products such as decking lighting, leafs lighting, marker lighting, cob strips and so on. But the problem I've got is the way in which the navigation is structured means I can't necessarily target all those products on one page. We talked before about the top-level navigation on the site. Is it possible that this could be looked at and structured in a more logical fashion?

**[25/09/2025, 12:05:32]** Dana: Hi Peter, thank you for the information,  I will discuss with Richard tomorrow and get back to you very soon

**[25/09/2025, 12:06:37]** Richard: We have recently redesigned and categorised the main navigation bar. We could of course make some adjustments, what is your suggestion for this?

**[25/09/2025, 13:05:47]** Peter Empson: Hi Richard. I'll take a look and send something over to you

**[25/09/2025, 15:00:56]** Peter Empson: Hi Richard, I've been working on a document today for your menu navigation. In particular, I've tried to address the fact that you have both retail and trade customers coming to the site, and that they have very different needs. On the one hand, the retail customer is potentially looking for either:
1. A lighting solution for a room
2. A type of lighting solution
3. A style
4. Inspiration
On the other hand, a trade customer is looking for a technical or application-based product and that requires a completely different menu structure.
The document tries to address both of these, and I think a blended approach of both of them will be best. The trade navigation could be addressed by just having a shop by product type.
Another thing to look at is filtering on the page so that the visitor can look at particular finishes or wattages of lamps.
It's not a complete solution this, but I'm hoping it will give you some food for thought - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haxK19zgGtHJxMNWz34eSVRbo1qb8xuaKmqIdXxyf4Q/edit?tab=t.0 [This message was edited]

**[25/09/2025, 15:17:00]** Richard: Thanks for your input Peter, we will review and see what we can do

**[25/09/2025, 15:23:44]** Peter Empson: It's a heavy document, Richard, but I think there are some things you can pull out of that that would make a big difference

**[30/09/2025, 11:11:02]** Peter Empson: Is this from Google My Business?

**[30/09/2025, 12:26:47]** Dana: No this is description on Google Ads Asset

**[30/09/2025, 12:27:03]** Dana: [image attached: 00000064-PHOTO-2025-09-30-12-27-03.jpg]

**[30/09/2025, 13:26:45]** Peter Empson: OK, I'll update that

**[30/09/2025, 13:30:54]** Peter Empson: All done, it may take a couple of hours for Google to approve it

**[30/09/2025, 13:33:05]** Dana: Thank you

### GTIN Updates & More Product Issues (6 October 2025)

**[06/10/2025, 13:10:59]** Dana: [image attached: 00000075-PHOTO-2025-10-06-13-10-59.jpg]

**[06/10/2025, 13:11:44]** Dana: Hi Peter, this product GTIN came up (didn't match retailer's catalog), would you able to take a look? Thank you

**[06/10/2025, 14:37:38]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, I'm looking now. This product is showing 9 different GTINs. This is probably caused by when variants are created. The original product has been there since 2024 and had 1 GTIN. Over time, new variants were created with their own GTINs, and now there are 9. The original GTIN was associated with the whole product. All of the newer ones are associated with their respective variants.

As well as the GTINs not matching, most of them are also invalid in the first place. As you can see on the attached image. 8 out of 9 are incorrect.

Could you check these and update them please? You can use this validator to check before you save them - https://www.gs1.org/services/verified-by-gs1/results

**[06/10/2025, 14:37:40]** Peter Empson: [image attached: 00000110-VIDEO-2025-10-07-11-54-33.mp4]

**[10/10/2025, 09:50:01]** Dana: [image attached: 00000116-PHOTO-2025-10-10-09-50-01.jpg]

**[10/10/2025, 09:50:01]** Dana: [image attached: 00000117-PHOTO-2025-10-10-09-50-01.jpg]

**[10/10/2025, 09:50:48]** Dana: Hi Peter, I noticed my latest Product Feed doesn't appear on Google. It was approved and running yesterday, but now it's missing. Could you please assist with this?

**[10/10/2025, 11:02:33]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, I'll take a look but yesterday's feed had a lot of GTIN errors in it which caused a number of products to be disapproved in Merchant Centre. At the moment I don't have any alerts set up when these problems crop up but I'm hoping to have this ready soon so that we both know about the problems

**[10/10/2025, 11:20:12]** Peter Empson: The products that disappeared from the feed were the Trimless Profiles. You changed the variants and it looks like the products didn't match up with Google's catalogue. I've run the feed again and they are now showing as pending approval, they should be live later today or tomorrow

**[10/10/2025, 11:20:53]** Dana: Thank you Peter. I will try to amend the GTINs on my end this afternoon

**[10/10/2025, 11:21:27]** Dana: Thank you very much

**[10/10/2025, 11:26:44]** Peter Empson: No problem. Just a reminder to let me know when you are making changes to variants so I can update the feed. Thanks

**[10/10/2025, 11:27:51]** Dana: Sure I will

### Google Shopping Listing Improvement Suggestions (11 November 2025)

### Google Shopping Preview Discussion (20 November 2025)

**[20/11/2025, 15:38:42]** Dana: [image attached: 00000144-PHOTO-2025-11-20-15-38-42.jpg]

**[20/11/2025, 15:40:05]** Dana: Hi Peter, hope you are well. I noticed sometimes product title on ads show like above and sometimes it shows the full title. Is that depending on whether the customer searches on phone or computer?

**[20/11/2025, 16:05:32]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana. Yes, the title that shows on a mobile is much shorter than the title that shows on a desktop because of the width of the screen. Plus you've also got to take into account the width of the image, which I mentioned to you in my voice note the other week. You can see on the screenshot that you've sent that the image is a landscape image and, as a consequence, takes up much more width and therefore allows less space for the title. You could try using a square or portrait image instead and see if that helps

**[20/11/2025, 16:09:26]** Dana: Thank you Peter

### Product Feed Update Request (25 November 2025)

**[25/11/2025, 13:23:20]** Dana: [image attached: 00000154-PHOTO-2025-11-25-13-23-20.jpg]

**[25/11/2025, 13:23:36]** Dana: [image attached: 00000155-PHOTO-2025-11-25-13-23-36.jpg]

**[25/11/2025, 13:25:02]** Dana: Hi Peter, I just made a small change to those two products yesterday, and they are showing as pending on Google Merchant Centre. This seems to have affected their visibility, as I can no longer find them in Google search today. Is there a way I can expedite the product feed approval? Please advise

**[25/11/2025, 13:28:19]** Peter Empson: Hi Dana, there isn't a way of speeding this up. It normally takes a couple of hours but it can sometimes take longer especially if Google wants to re-crawl the website

**[25/11/2025, 13:30:40]** Dana: Ok noted
