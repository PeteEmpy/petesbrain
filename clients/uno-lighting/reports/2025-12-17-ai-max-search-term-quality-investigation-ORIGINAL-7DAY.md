|-------------|--------|-------|------|---------|------|---------|
| **uno lighting** | 47 | £7.86 | 3.97 | £330.54 | **4204%** | ✅ Excellent |

## 2. Shopping Campaign Search Term Quality Issues

### Campaign: UNO | Shopping | H&S, Zombies and Boosts

**Current Performance (Dec 15-17):**
- **Spend:** £756.89
- **Conversions:** 4.81
- **Revenue:** £820.09
- **ROAS:** 108% ⚠️ (48pp below 156% target)
- **Search Impression Share:** 69% (healthy, budget not the constraint)

### 🚨 Problem: High-Volume Zero-Conversion Search Terms

**Top 10 Zero-Conversion Terms (Last 7 Days):**

| Search Term | Clicks | Spend | Conv | Issue |
|-------------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| led strip lights | 26 | £19.08 | 0 | Generic, high CPC |
| led profile | 10 | £14.77 | 0 | Too broad |
| seamless led strip | 7 | £19.24 | 0 | High CPC, no conv |
| brass plinth lights | 6 | £9.65 | 0 | **Irrelevant product** |
| led track | 5 | £10.09 | 0 | Ambiguous intent |
| shower niche lighting | 5 | £11.19 | 0 | **Irrelevant product** |
| bronze wall lights | 4 | £6.94 | 0 | **Irrelevant product** |
| external wall lights | 3 | £4.08 | 0 | **Irrelevant product** |
| emergency lights | 4 | £1.86 | 0 | **Wrong product category** |
| outdoor wall lights | 4 | £5.57 | 0 | **Irrelevant** (no outdoor wall lights) |

**TOTAL WASTE:** £102.47 in 7 days = **£428/month wasted spend on zero-conversion terms**

### Converting Search Terms (For Context)

Only 2 converting terms found in last 7 days:

| Search Term | Clicks | Spend | Conv | Revenue | ROAS |
|-------------|--------|-------|------|---------|------|
| staircase step lights indoor | 4 | £4.05 | 0.8 | £165.85 | **4096%** ✅ |
| niche light | 3 | £3.89 | 1.0 | £25.65 | 659% ✅ |

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why is Shopping campaign showing poor search term quality?**

1. **Product feed broad-match expanding to irrelevant categories**
   - Uno sells LED strips, downlights, profiles - NOT wall lights, emergency lights, outdoor fixtures
   - Google's algorithm matching on "lighting" broadly

2. **Missing negative keywords**
   - No negative keywords for product categories Uno doesn't sell
   - "wall lights", "emergency", "outdoor wall", "bronze", "brass" should all be negated

3. **Generic terms draining budget without converting**
   - "led strip lights" (26 clicks, £19, 0 conv) - too generic, need more specific
   - "led profile" (10 clicks, £15, 0 conv) - ambiguous intent

4. **High CPCs on irrelevant traffic**
   - "seamless led strip" - £2.75 CPC, 0 conversions
   - "shower niche lighting" - £2.24 CPC, 0 conversions

## 3. Conversion Lag Caveat

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Current Period Data Incomplete

**From Uno Lighting CONTEXT.md:** This account has a documented 26-66% conversion lag (1-2 days).

**Impact on Current Analysis:**

| Metric | Click Date View (Used) | Actual (Estimated) | Status |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **ROAS** | 124% ⚠️ | ~200-220% ✅ | Incomplete |
| **Conversions** | 24.5 | ~38-45 | Incomplete |
| **Revenue** | £2,697 | £4,000-5,000 | Incomplete |

**Evidence of Lag:**
- Dec 15: 17.6 conv by click date, but 25 conv occurred that day (30% from prior clicks)
- Dec 16: 7.0 conv by click date, but 13 conv occurred that day (46% from prior clicks)
- Dec 17 (today): 0 conv by click date (no time to convert yet)

**Recommendation:**
- **Re-analyse Friday 20th December** when Dec 15-17 data fully mature
- Current "ROAS drop" likely artifact, not real performance issue
- Use conversion_date metrics for accurate view (requires 2-3 day delay)

## 4. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

#### P1: Clean Up Shopping Campaign Search Terms

**Add Negative Keywords:**

**Exact Match Negatives** (products Uno doesn't sell):
```
[wall lights]
[wall light]
[outdoor wall lights]
[external wall lights]
[bronze wall lights]
[brass plinth lights]
[emergency lights]
[emergency light]
[shower niche lighting]
[pendant lights]
[uplights]
[garden spike lights]
[bulkhead lights]
```

**Phrase Match Negatives** (broad categories to exclude):
```
"emergency"
"outdoor wall"
"brass"
"bronze"
"pendant"
"chandelier"
"table lamp"
"floor lamp"
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Save £100-150/week in wasted spend
- Improve Shopping campaign ROAS from 108% to 140-160%
- Free up budget for converting terms

#### P2: Monitor Generic High-Volume Terms

Add to monitoring list (consider negating if no conversions in next 7 days):
- "led strip lights" (26 clicks, £19, 0 conv)
- "led profile" (10 clicks, £15, 0 conv)
- "led track" (5 clicks, £10, 0 conv)

### Follow-Up Actions (Next Week)

#### P2: Re-analyse Performance with Mature Data

**Date:** Friday 20th December 2025
**Action:** Re-run this analysis using Dec 15-17 data (now fully mature)
**Expected Outcome:** ROAS likely 200-220%, not 124%

#### P3: Product Feed Optimisation

**Review product titles in Merchant Centre:**
- Ensure specific product types clearly labelled (downlights, LED strips, profiles)
- Avoid generic "lighting" terms that trigger broad matches
- Add product type attributes to improve Google's category matching

#### P3: Search Term Monitoring Cadence

**Establish weekly review:**
- Check Shopping campaign search terms every Monday
- Add negatives proactively before significant spend accumulates
- Target: Keep zero-conversion term spend <5% of campaign budget
