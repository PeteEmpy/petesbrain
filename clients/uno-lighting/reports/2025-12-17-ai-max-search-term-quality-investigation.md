   - 225% ROAS (69pp above 156% target)
   - Highly relevant search terms only
   - 100% search impression share

2. ⚠️ **Search Term Quality: 4 High-Confidence Negative Candidates Identified**
   - £403 wasted in 60 days (£806/month projected)
   - Only 6% of terms (4/69) meet high-confidence threshold
   - 39 additional terms (57%) require monitoring

3. 📊 **Account Performance Trend**
   - 30-day spend: £26,000
   - 30-day conversions: 404
   - Recent data affected by 26-66% conversion lag

### Critical Actions Required

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1** | Add 4 high-confidence negative keywords to Shopping campaign | Save £800/month wasted spend |
| **P2** | Monitor 39 Tier 2 terms over next 30 days | Catch emerging waste patterns early |
| **P3** | Re-analyse Friday 20th Dec with mature data | Get accurate current ROAS (conversion lag artifact) |

---

## 1. Methodology & Statistical Approach

### Why the Original Analysis Was Insufficient

**Original approach (3-7 days):**
- "led strip lights": 26 clicks in 7 days = 3.7 clicks/day
- Insufficient statistical power for confident decisions
- Seasonal variance not captured
- Conversion lag (26-66%) compounds data immaturity

**Revised approach (30-60 days):**
- "led strip lights": 177 clicks in 60 days = 2.95 clicks/day (more stable)
- Sufficient volume for statistical significance
- Captures seasonal patterns and trends
- Longer lookback reduces conversion lag impact

### Three-Tier Classification System

**Tier 1 - Strong Negative Candidates:**
- 30+ clicks in 60 days
- 0 conversions (or <0.1)
- Total spend £20+
- **Statistical confidence: HIGH** - safe to add as negative keywords

**Tier 2 - Monitor Closely:**
- 10-29 clicks in 60 days
- 0 conversions (or <0.1)
- **Statistical confidence: MEDIUM** - watch for next 30 days, move to Tier 1 if pattern continues

**Tier 3 - Insufficient Data:**
- <10 clicks in 60 days
- **Statistical confidence: LOW** - need more data before any decision

---

## 3. 60-Day Search Term Classification Results

### Overall Statistics

**Total unique search terms analysed:** 69 terms
**Period:** 18th October - 17th December 2025 (60 days)

| Category | Terms | % of Total | Spend | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Converting** | 26 | 38% | £853.20 | 85.4 conversions, 1520% ROAS ✅ |
| **Tier 1 (High confidence)** | 4 | 6% | £403.18 | Strong negative candidates 🚨 |
| **Tier 2 (Medium confidence)** | 39 | 57% | £698.28 | Monitor closely ⚠️ |
| **Tier 3 (Low confidence)** | 0 | 0% | £0.00 | Insufficient data |

**Key Insight:** All terms have 10+ clicks (no Tier 3 terms), indicating good data maturity for 60-day period.

---

## 4. Tier 1: Strong Negative Candidates (High Confidence)

**Criteria:** 30+ clicks, 0 conversions, £20+ spend
**Statistical Confidence:** HIGH (safe to add as negative keywords)
**Total Waste:** £403.18 in 60 days = **£806/month projected**

| Search Term | Clicks | Spend | CPC | 60-Day Pattern |
|-------------|--------|-------|-----|----------------|
| **led strip lights** | 177 | £152.08 | £0.86 | 2.95 clicks/day, 0 conv |
| **led plaster in profile** | 52 | £116.31 | £2.24 | 0.87 clicks/day, 0 conv |
| **plaster in downlights** | 43 | £90.40 | £2.10 | 0.72 clicks/day, 0 conv |
| **led light strips** | 43 | £44.39 | £1.03 | 0.72 clicks/day, 0 conv |

### Why These 4 Terms Meet High-Confidence Threshold

1. **Sufficient volume:** 30+ clicks provides statistical power
2. **Consistent pattern:** Zero conversions over 60 days (not seasonal variance)
3. **Material spend:** £20+ spend justifies action
4. **No product assumptions:** Classification based purely on performance metrics

### Comparison to Converting Terms

For context, terms that ARE converting with similar or lower volume:

| Search Term | Clicks | Conv | Revenue | ROAS |
|-------------|--------|------|---------|------|
| led track | 30 | 1.0 | £346.50 | 801% ✅ |
| plasterboard led profile | 17 | 2.0 | £300.73 | 924% ✅ |
| led profile plaster in | 10 | 3.0 | £276.06 | 1581% ✅ |

This demonstrates that similar or even LOWER click volumes CAN convert - the Tier 1 terms are genuinely underperforming, not just low-traffic.

### Recommended Action

**Add as negative keywords (exact match) to Shopping campaign:**

```
[led strip lights]
[led plaster in profile]
[plaster in downlights]
[led light strips]
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Save £800/month in wasted spend
- Free up budget for converting terms
- Improve Shopping campaign ROAS from 108% towards 156% target

---

## 5. Tier 2: Monitor Closely (Medium Confidence)

**Criteria:** 10-29 clicks, 0 conversions
**Statistical Confidence:** MEDIUM (insufficient for immediate action)
**Total Spend:** £698.28 in 60 days
**Action:** Watch for next 30 days. Add to Tier 1 if pattern continues.

**Top 20 Tier 2 Terms (by spend):**

| Search Term | Clicks | Spend | CPC | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|-----|-------|
| plaster in spotlights | 22 | £47.54 | £2.16 | Approaching 30-click threshold |
| led strip light channel | 20 | £34.73 | £1.74 | High CPC, no conversions yet |
| outdoor wall lights | 23 | £32.67 | £1.42 | 23 clicks - could hit Tier 1 soon |
| recessed spotlights | 25 | £31.89 | £1.28 | Close to 30-click threshold |
| niche lights | 20 | £31.53 | £1.58 | Zero conv despite good volume |
| mini downlights | 19 | £30.53 | £1.61 | Approaching threshold |
| bronze wall lights | 14 | £29.04 | £2.07 | High CPC |
| aluminium led profile | 17 | £28.90 | £1.70 | No conversions yet |
| garden spike lights | 16 | £22.24 | £1.39 | Monitor |
| marker lights | 16 | £22.16 | £1.39 | Monitor |
| plaster in lights | 10 | £20.89 | £2.09 | High CPC, low volume |
| plastered in downlights | 11 | £19.75 | £1.80 | Monitor |
| led strips | 12 | £19.72 | £1.64 | Generic term |
| recessed led strip lighting | 15 | £19.50 | £1.30 | Has 0.06 conv (near-zero) |
| led track light | 15 | £19.10 | £1.27 | Monitor |
| led light track | 20 | £18.63 | £0.93 | Zero conv |
| emergency light | 15 | £18.49 | £1.23 | Monitor |
| led strip light | 18 | £18.47 | £1.03 | Monitor |
| led channel track | 16 | £18.35 | £1.15 | Monitor |
| downlights | 12 | £16.96 | £1.41 | Generic |

**... and 19 more terms** (total 39 terms in Tier 2)

### Tier 2 Management Strategy

**Weekly review (every Monday):**
1. Check which Tier 2 terms have reached 30+ clicks
2. Review conversion performance
3. Move to Tier 1 if they meet high-confidence criteria (30+ clicks, 0 conv, £20+ spend)
4. Add as negatives at that point

**Watch list - terms approaching Tier 1:**
- recessed spotlights (25 clicks, £31.89)
- outdoor wall lights (23 clicks, £32.67)
- plaster in spotlights (22 clicks, £47.54)

These could hit the 30-click threshold in the next 7-10 days.

---

## 6. Tier 3: Insufficient Data

**Criteria:** <10 clicks in 60 days
**Result:** 0 terms in this category

**Interpretation:** All search terms have achieved 10+ clicks in 60 days, indicating:
- Good search term volume overall
- Data is sufficiently mature for analysis
- No "long tail" micro-terms to worry about

---

## 7. Converting Terms (Performance Context)

**Total:** 26 converting terms
**Combined Performance:** £853.20 spend, 85.4 conversions, £12,977 revenue, 1520% ROAS

**Top 10 Converting Terms:**

| Search Term | Clicks | Conv | Revenue | ROAS |
|-------------|--------|------|---------|------|
| uno lighting | 462 | 43.8 | £7,109.67 | 7128% |
| led strip lights for ceiling | 67 | 2.0 | £1,205.43 | 3417% |
| uno lights | 43 | 6.0 | £645.36 | 3704% |
| led profile strip | 11 | 3.0 | £482.96 | 3373% |
| led profile channel | 18 | 1.0 | £379.54 | 2093% |
| plaster in led profile | 57 | 4.4 | £376.83 | 313% |
| led track | 30 | 1.0 | £346.50 | 801% |
| plasterboard led profile | 17 | 2.0 | £300.73 | 924% |
| plaster in led channel | 11 | 1.3 | £288.43 | 1008% |
| led profile plaster in | 10 | 3.0 | £276.06 | 1581% |

**Key Observations:**
- Brand terms ("uno lighting", "uno lights") drive majority of conversions
- Profile-related terms converting well despite modest click volumes
- Several terms with 10-20 clicks achieving strong ROAS (shows Tier 1 terms genuinely underperforming)

**These terms must be PROTECTED** - do not add variations of these as negative keywords.

## 8. 30-Day Account Performance Trend

### Overall Account Metrics (17th Nov - 16th Dec 2025)

**30-Day Totals:**
- **Spend:** £26,000
- **Conversions:** 404 (by click date)
- **Revenue:** Data pending full analysis
- **Impression Share:** Varies by campaign

**Daily Performance Pattern:**

The 30-day data shows relatively stable spend patterns (£800-900/day average) with conversion volumes varying by day (likely affected by 1-2 day conversion lag).

### Campaign-Level Performance (Recent 3-Day Period)

| Campaign | Spend | Conv | Revenue | ROAS | vs. Target (156%) |
|----------|-------|------|---------|------|-------------------|
| P Max H&S | £1,188 | 14.8 | £1,646 | 139% | -17pp (lag artifact) |
| Shopping H&S | £757 | 4.8 | £820 | 108% | -48pp (+ term quality issues) |
| P Max Villains | £197 | 3.0 | £157 | 80% | -76pp (lag artifact) |
| Search Brand (AI Max) | £33 | 2.0 | £74 | 225% | +69pp ✅ |

**Note:** Recent period (Dec 15-17) affected by conversion lag. True ROAS likely 200%+ when data matures.

---

## 9. Conversion Lag Caveat (Still Relevant)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Current Period Data Incomplete

**From Uno Lighting CONTEXT.md:** This account has documented 26-66% conversion lag (1-2 days).

**Impact on Recent 3-Day Analysis (Dec 15-17):**

| Metric | Click Date View | Actual (Estimated) | Status |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **ROAS** | 124% ⚠️ | ~200-220% ✅ | Incomplete |
| **Conversions** | 24.5 | ~38-45 | Incomplete |
| **Revenue** | £2,697 | £4,000-5,000 | Incomplete |

**Evidence of Lag:**
- Dec 15: 17.6 conv by click date, but 25 conv occurred (30% from prior clicks)
- Dec 16: 7.0 conv by click date, but 13 conv occurred (46% from prior clicks)
- Dec 17: 0 conv by click date (no time to convert yet)

**Recommendation:**
- **Re-analyse Friday 20th December** when Dec 15-17 data fully mature
- Current "ROAS drop" likely measurement artifact, not real performance issue
- 60-day search term analysis NOT affected (historical data is complete)

## 10. Recommendations & Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

#### P1: Add High-Confidence Negative Keywords

**To Shopping Campaign(s):**

**Exact Match Negatives:**
```
[led strip lights]
[led plaster in profile]
[plaster in downlights]
[led light strips]
```

**Why exact match?**
- Prevents blocking close variants that DO convert (e.g., "led strip lights for ceiling" converts at 3417% ROAS)
- Precise targeting of non-performing terms only

**Implementation:**
1. Navigate to Shopping campaign in Google Ads
2. Go to Keywords → Negative Keywords
3. Add each term as exact match negative
4. Document change in campaign notes

**Expected Impact:**
- Immediate: Block £13-14/day wasted spend (£400-420/month)
- Within 7 days: Shopping campaign ROAS should improve 5-10pp
- Within 30 days: Full £800/month waste reduction realised

#### P2: Schedule Weekly Tier 2 Review

**Every Monday:**
1. Pull 60-day search term report
2. Check which Tier 2 terms have reached 30+ clicks
3. Evaluate conversion performance
4. Move qualifying terms to Tier 1 and add as negatives

**Target:** Keep zero-conversion spend <5% of campaign budget

### Follow-Up Actions (Next Week)

#### P2: Re-analyse Performance with Mature Data (Friday 20th Dec)

**Date:** Friday 20th December 2025
**Action:** Re-run 3-day analysis for Dec 15-17 period (now fully mature)
**Expected Outcome:**
- ROAS should show ~200-220% (not 124%)
- Confirms conversion lag was causing apparent "drop"
- No action needed if ROAS recovers as expected

#### P3: Tier 2 Term Monitoring Setup

**Establish monitoring cadence:**
- Weekly search term review (Mondays)
- Track Tier 2 terms approaching 30-click threshold
- Add to Tier 1 proactively when criteria met
- Target: <5% of budget on zero-conversion terms

### No Action Required

#### Product Catalogue Verification

**Decision:** NOT NEEDED for this analysis

**Rationale:**
- All recommendations based purely on statistical performance
- No product category assumptions made
- Terms classified solely by click volume, conversion rate, and spend
- Product relevance discussion deferred (separate client conversation if needed)

---

## 11. Comparison: Original vs. Revised Analysis

### Original Analysis (7-Day Lookback)

**Flagged as problematic:** 20+ terms including:
- "outdoor wall lights" (4 clicks, £5.57)
- "emergency lights" (4 clicks, £1.86)
- "brass plinth lights" (6 clicks, £9.65)
- "bronze wall lights" (4 clicks, £6.94)
- Many others with <10 clicks

**Issues:**
- Insufficient statistical power (many terms <10 clicks in 7 days)
- Too short period to establish patterns
- Made product category assumptions (some were wrong)

### Revised Analysis (60-Day Lookback)

**Flagged as high-confidence negatives:** 4 terms only:
- "led strip lights" (177 clicks, £152.08, 0 conv)
- "led plaster in profile" (52 clicks, £116.31, 0 conv)
- "plaster in downlights" (43 clicks, £90.40, 0 conv)
- "led light strips" (43 clicks, £44.39, 0 conv)

**Improvements:**
- All terms meet 30+ click threshold (statistical significance)
- 60-day period captures patterns, not noise
- Zero product assumptions - purely statistical
- 39 additional terms in "monitor" category (not flagged for immediate action)

**Result:** More accurate, defensible, and lower-risk recommendations.

## 13. Next Steps

### For Peter

**Today (17th Dec):**
- ✅ Review revised report
- Add 4 exact-match negative keywords to Shopping campaign
- Schedule weekly search term review (Mondays)

**Friday 20th Dec:**
- Re-run analysis for Dec 15-17 with mature data

- Verify negative keywords reducing waste

**Monday 23rd Dec:**
- First weekly Tier 2 review
- Check terms approaching 30-click threshold
- Add any new Tier 1 candidates as negatives

### For Client

**No immediate client communication needed**

This is operational optimisation (negative keywords) within normal account management scope.

**Potential communication (if requested or if ROAS doesn't recover by 20th Dec):**
- Email update with performance context
- Explain conversion lag effect on recent data
- Share search term quality improvements implemented

---

## 14. Key Learnings: Short vs. Long Time Periods

### What We Learned from This Analysis

**Short time periods (3-7 days) are insufficient because:**
1. **Low statistical power:** Many terms have <10 clicks (not enough for confident decisions)
2. **Seasonal noise:** Day-of-week effects, promotional periods mask true patterns
3. **Conversion lag compounds issues:** 26-66% lag means recent data always incomplete
4. **False positives:** Terms that appear "bad" in 7 days may convert given more time

**Longer time periods (30-60 days) provide:**
1. **Statistical significance:** 30+ click threshold ensures reliable patterns
2. **Pattern capture:** Sufficient time to see true performance trends
3. **Reduced noise:** Seasonal and daily variations average out
4. **Confident decisions:** Lower risk of false positives or premature actions

**Practical example from this analysis:**
- **"led strip lights"** (7 days): 26 clicks, 0 conv → "might be bad, but not enough data"
- **"led strip lights"** (60 days): 177 clicks, 0 conv → "definitely underperforming, confident negative candidate"

**Conclusion:** For negative keyword decisions, always use 60-90 day lookback with 30+ click minimum threshold.
