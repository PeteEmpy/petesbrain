      "notes": "---\n**Source:** Client Agreement (2025-11-12)\n**Client:** uno-lighting\n**Priority:** P2 (Monitoring - not urgent)\n**Time Estimate:** 45 mins\n**Reason:** Richard agreed to full \u00a3500/day budget increase via WhatsApp on Nov 12. Implementation deferred until campaigns show budget constraint.\n---\n\n**UPDATE (2025-11-19):** Still no budget constraint - campaigns operating well below capacity.\n- **Today's spend:** \u00a3598/day (45% of \u00a31,330 total budget)\n- **Budget lost IS:** 0% across all campaigns\n- **Main H&S PMax:** \u00a3354/day (48% of \u00a3730 budget)\n- **Shopping:** \u00a3172/day (43% of \u00a3400 budget)\n- **Villains:** \u00a358/day (53% of \u00a3110 budget)\n- **Conclusion:** Continue monitoring - no action needed yet\n\n**UPDATE (2025-11-14):** No capacity yet in campaigns to accommodate new budget. Need to check again Tuesday next week.\n\n**STRATEGY (2025-11-13):** Monitor daily - implement \u00a3500/day increase ONLY when budget constraint appears\n- **Current Status:** NOT budget-limited (0% budget lost impression share)\n- **Trigger:** When budget lost IS rises above 10% consistently OR peak demand drives spend to limits\n- **Current Spend:** \u00a3598/day (well below \u00a31,330 approved limit)\n\n**Budget Allocation (when triggered):**\n- Main PMax: Increase budget (pending capacity)\n- Shopping: Increase to address impression loss (pending capacity)\n- Brand: Maintain strong 3x ROAS performance\n- Villains: Enable new customer acquisition (pending capacity)\n\n**Expected Revenue:** \u00a35,400/day at 300% ROAS = \u00a3130k (Nov 13 - Dec 6)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Check again Thursday Nov 21 (approaching Black Friday week)\n2. Monitor for Black Friday demand surge\n3. Implement budget increase if capacity appears\n4. Alert client if ROAS drops below 200%\n5. Confirm implementation to Richard via WhatsApp when triggered\n\n**UPDATE (2025-11-19 Evening):** Still no budget constraint - continue monitoring.\n- Manual check confirmed no activity requiring budget increase\n- Next review: Monday Nov 25 (Black Friday week approach)",
