## Performance By Category

### 1. Chloe Marker Lights ⚠️ **DANA'S PRIORITY**

Only **1 Chloe product** found in top 100 (out of 4 Dana listed):

**3W Mini Black LED IP44 Marker Light, Small Downlight/Spotlight, Niche/Alcove/Soffit Light**
- Impressions: 11,655 (rank: ~38th)
- Clicks: 147 (CTR: 1.26%)
- Conversions: 3.9 (CR: 2.67%)
- Spend: £177.55
- Revenue: £729.89
- **ROAS: 411%** ✅ Strong

**Missing from top 100:**
- 3W Chloe LED IP44 2800K/4000K/6000K CCT Colour Changing Fluted Marker
- 3W Chloe Fluted CCT Marker Light variants (2 other SKUs)

**Analysis:** The Chloe products Dana mentioned are **not appearing in top 100**, suggesting they have very low impression share. The one Black Chloe that appears has excellent ROAS (411%) but low volume.

### 2. CCT Bulkhead (4 products listed, 4 found)

**Emergency Function 12W/18W/24W**
- Impressions: 42,805
- ROAS: 134% ⚠️ Below target
- CR: 1.30%

**5 Pack Microwave Sensor**
- Impressions: 32,916
- ROAS: 325% ✅
- CR: 3.05% ✅ Strong

**Microwave Sensor Emergency**
- Impressions: 25,855
- ROAS: 112% ❌ Poor
- CR: 1.52%

**Microwave Sensor (standard)**
- Impressions: 13,646
- ROAS: 133% ⚠️ Below target
- CR: 2.73%

**Analysis:** Mixed performance. 5 Pack Microwave Sensor performs well (325% ROAS), but Emergency variants underperform significantly (112-134% ROAS).

### 3. Switches & Sockets (7 products listed, 1 found)

**2 Gang 2 Way Toggle Light Switch (Brushed Brass / Matte Gold)**
- Impressions: 12,355
- Clicks: 103
- **Conversions: 0** ❌
- Spend: £115
- Revenue: £0
- **ROAS: 0%**

**Missing from top 100:**
- 1 Gang 2 Way Toggle Light Switch
- 1 Gang Knurled Dimmer Switch Matt Black
- All Double Plug Socket variants (3 products)
- 2 Gang 2 Way Rocker Light Switch

**Analysis:** CRITICAL - Toggle Switch spending budget with zero return. Other switches/sockets not visible at all.

## Why Products Are Underperforming

### 1. Product Hero Classification **CONFIRMED**

**Campaign Structure Analysis:**
- **UNO | P Max | Heroes & Sidekicks** - 532,171 impressions (main revenue driver)
- **UNO | Shopping | H&S, Zombies and Boosts** - 436,934 impressions (mixed bag)
- **UNO | P Max Shopping | Villains** - 145,789 impressions (underperformers)
- **UNO | Search | Brand** - 921 impressions (brand protection)

**Likely Classifications:**
- **Chloe CCT products**: Zombies/Villains (low visibility, not in top 100)
- **Toggle Light Switch**: Villains (0 conversions, £115 wasted)
- **Emergency Function Bulkheads**: Villains (112-134% ROAS)
- **Microwave Sensor 5 Pack**: Heroes & Sidekicks (325% ROAS, good performance)

This means these products are:
- Getting lower budget allocation (Villains campaign has 73% less impressions than H&S)
- Being crowded out by top performers (LED strips, Banbury downlights)
- Not appearing in main PMax asset groups

### 2. Seasonal Demand Patterns
- Switches/sockets: Lower search volume (DIY/renovation seasonality)
- Decorative lighting: Competition from established brands in Q4

### 3. Feed Issues (Hypothesis - needs verification)
- Possible GTIN conflicts
- Product titles may not be optimised for search terms
- Missing in some campaign product groups

### 4. Christmas Quiet Period Approaching
- Search demand typically drops post-Christmas delivery cut-off
- Won't see movement until January when demand returns

## Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)

**1. Chloe CCT Investigation - P0**
- Pull complete product feed data for all 4 Chloe CCT SKUs
- Check if they're disapproved or have feed errors
- Verify Product Hero labels
- Check if they're in active PMax asset groups

**2. Toggle Light Switch - PAUSE**
- **Pause the 2 Gang Toggle Switch immediately** (£115 spend, 0 conversions)
- Investigate why switches aren't converting (price? competition? search intent mismatch?)

**3. Product Hero Review**
- Check current Hero/Sidekick/Villain/Zombie classifications
- Request Product Hero to re-classify based on historical performance (Chloe was top 5 seller)

### SHORT TERM (Next 2 Weeks)

**4. Feed Optimisation**
- Review product titles for SEO keywords
- Ensure all variants have correct GTINs
- Add missing products to active Shopping/PMax campaigns

**5. Asset Group Creation**
- Consider creating dedicated PMax asset group for:
  - Chloe Marker Lights
  - High-performing CCT Bulkhead (Microwave Sensor 5 Pack)

**6. Budget Reallocation**
- Temporarily reduce budget on underperforming Emergency Function bulkheads
- Reallocate to proven performers until products optimised

### Q1 2026 (Post-Christmas)

**7. Full Product Audit**
- Compare current vs 6 months ago performance for all 20 products
- Identify when decline started
- Check for external factors (competitors, price changes, reviews)

**8. Testing Strategy**
- A/B test different product titles
- Test standalone Shopping campaigns for switches/sockets category
- Consider separate strategy for trade/professional buyers vs consumers

## Data Gaps - Still Need To Pull

1. **Historical comparison:** 6 months ago vs now for same products
2. **Complete product feed status:** All 20 products, not just top 100
3. **Product Hero labels:** Current classifications
4. **Search terms report:** What queries are (or aren't) triggering these products
5. **Merchant Centre issues:** Any disapprovals or warnings
6. **Competitor analysis:** Who's ranking for "Chloe CCT marker light"?

---

## Next Steps

**FOR PETER:**
1. Pull complete feed data for all 20 products
2. Check Product Hero classifications
3. Review Merchant Centre for errors
4. Analyse search terms (if any) for these products
5. Create detailed comparison: Sept-Oct vs Nov for decline analysis

**FOR DANA:**
1. Provide any internal sales data for these products (website direct?)
2. Confirm when Chloe CCT was last a top 5 seller (month/year)
3. Any recent changes: prices, descriptions, stock levels?
4. European expansion - table until Q1, focus on UK optimisation first

---

## Timeline Expectations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** We're entering the Christmas quiet period. Even with optimisations, we're unlikely to see significant movement until **January 2026** when search demand returns post-holidays.

**This week:** Data gathering + immediate fixes (pause Toggle Switch)
**December:** Feed optimisation + Product Hero review
**January:** Monitor results as search volume returns
**February:** Assess if products recovering, adjust strategy accordingly

---

## Cost of Inaction

If we don't address this:
- **Toggle Switch:** Continue wasting £50-100/month with 0 return
- **Chloe CCT:** Remain invisible, former top 5 seller continues decline
- **Emergency bulkheads:** Drag down account ROAS (currently 112-134%)
- **Switches/sockets overall:** 6 products invisible, potential revenue lost

**Estimated monthly waste:** £150-200 on non-performing products
**Opportunity cost:** Unknown (need to understand Chloe's historical revenue)

---

## Questions for Dana & Richard

1. When was Chloe CCT last performing well? (Need specific month/year)
2. What was its monthly revenue at peak?
3. Any internal sales data showing it still sells via other channels?
4. Have there been stock issues, price increases, or supplier changes?
5. Do you have customer feedback about why it's declined?
