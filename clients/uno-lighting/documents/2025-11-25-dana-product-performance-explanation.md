# Email to Dana - Product Performance Explanation

**Date:** 25 November 2025
**To:** Dana Lu (danalu@savelightuk.com)
**From:** Peter Empson
**Subject:** Analysis: Why Your Priority Products Aren't Getting Exposure
**Status:** Draft ready for review

## Email Context

Dana sent a list of 20 underperforming products (especially Chloe CCT marker lights which were formerly a top 5 seller). She wants to know why they've declined and wants them boosted.

**Key message to communicate:**
1. These products DID get exposure initially when launched
2. Over time, Google's algorithm saw they had poor ROAS (below the 205% target)
3. Google automatically reduced their exposure because they weren't profitable enough
4. This is Product Hero working correctly - protecting profit margins
5. Most products are now in "Villains" or "Zombies" campaigns with very low budgets

**Tone:** Educational but empathetic. She needs to understand this is data-driven, not arbitrary.

## Key Data Points to Include

### Current Performance (Last 60 Days)
- **Only 6 of 20 products** found in top 100 by impressions
- **14 products invisible** (Zombie classification)
- Overall ROAS: 209% (just above target of 205%)
- One product: **0% ROAS** (£115 wasted)

### Campaign Structure Evidence
- **Heroes & Sidekicks campaign:** 532,171 impressions (main revenue driver)
- **Villains campaign:** 145,789 impressions (73% FEWER impressions)
- Dana's products are in Villains/Zombies due to historical underperformance

### Specific Examples

**Chloe CCT Marker Lights:**
- Only 1 of 4 variants visible (Black variant: 411% ROAS but LOW volume)
- Other 3 variants: Not in top 100 (extremely low impression share)
- Former top 5 seller but ROAS likely dropped below target over time

**CCT Bulkheads:**
- Emergency Function: 134% ROAS ❌ (34% below target)
- Microwave Sensor Emergency: 112% ROAS ❌ (45% below target)
- 5 Pack Microwave Sensor: 325% ROAS ✅ (Good performer - this one IS getting exposure)

**Toggle Light Switch:**
- 2 Gang Brass/Gold: **0 conversions**, £115 wasted
- This product is actively LOSING money

### What Happened

**Phase 1: Launch (Initial Exposure)**
- Products given fair share of budget
- Google tested them with real traffic
- Collected performance data

**Phase 2: Performance Evaluation**
- Google's algorithm calculated actual ROAS
- Products falling below 205% target flagged as "Villains"
- Products with near-zero conversions marked as "Zombies"

**Phase 3: Budget Reallocation (Current State)**
- High ROAS products (Heroes) get 73% MORE budget
- Low ROAS products (Villains) get 73% LESS budget
- Zombie products get minimal exposure

**This is automated optimization protecting your profit margins.**

## Recommendations for Email

1. **Pause the Toggle Switch immediately** (0% ROAS)
2. **Keep exposure LOW on poor performers** (Emergency bulkheads at 112-134%)
3. **Investigate WHY Chloe declined:**
   - Price increased?
   - Competitors appeared?
   - Product quality issues?
   - Reviews declined?
   - Stock problems historically?

4. **Don't artificially boost without fixing root cause** - will just waste more budget

---

## Questions to Ask Dana

1. When exactly was Chloe CCT a "top 5 seller"? (Need month/year)
2. What was its monthly revenue at peak?
3. Does it still sell well via other channels (organic/direct)?
4. Any changes since peak: price, supplier, stock availability, product updates?
5. Customer feedback - why might demand have dropped?

## Tone Guidelines

- **Empathetic:** "I understand it's frustrating when products you believe in aren't getting exposure"
- **Educational:** "Let me explain how Google's automated systems work"
- **Data-driven:** "The numbers show these products have struggled with profitability"
- **Protective:** "The system is actually protecting your margins by not overspending on unprofitable products"
- **Solution-focused:** "Let's find out WHY they declined, then we can address the root cause"

## What NOT to Say

- ❌ "I can just turn up the exposure" (will waste budget)
- ❌ "Google is wrong about these products" (data doesn't lie)
- ❌ "This is because of Product Hero" (sounds like blame-shifting)
- ✅ INSTEAD: "The automated system has identified these products aren't meeting your profitability targets"
