---

## Strategic Budget Allocation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Black Friday Ramp-Up (Nov 12-21)
**Objective:** Build momentum and capture early Black Friday demand

**Daily Budget Allocation (£1,300/day total):**
- **Main Performance Max (Heroes & Sidekicks):** £800/day (62% - reduce from current £1,200/day to fit within total)
- **Shopping Campaign:** £400/day (31% - reduce from current £670/day, still addresses impression loss)
- **Search Brand Campaign:** £70/day (5% - maintain strong performance)
- **Performance Max (Villains):** £25/day (2% - enable new customer acquisition)
- **Buffer/Testing:** £5/day (<1%)

**Note:** Current Main PMax (£1,200) and Shopping (£670) total £1,870/day, exceeding £1,300/day target. This allocation prioritizes Main PMax while maintaining Shopping budget sufficient to address impression loss.

**ROAS Strategy:**
- Maintain current 205% target on main campaigns
- Monitor conversion rate trends daily
- If conversion rates improve >2.3%, consider gradual reduction to 195%

**Key Actions:**
- Enable new customer acquisition on Villains campaign (as discussed in meeting)
- Monitor Shopping campaign impression share daily
- Review AI Max search terms weekly for quality

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Capture "Fake Friday" demand (week before Black Friday - 80% of BF demand, 27% cheaper CPCs)
- Build campaign learning before peak period
- Test budget allocation before Black Friday surge

---

### Phase 2: Black Friday Peak Period (Nov 22-30)
**Objective:** Maximize revenue during highest demand period

**Daily Budget Allocation (£1,300/day total):**
- **Main Performance Max (Heroes & Sidekicks):** £850/day (65% - scale main driver, increase from Phase 1)
- **Shopping Campaign:** £380/day (29% - slight reduction to prioritize Main PMax during peak)
- **Search Brand Campaign:** £50/day (4% - maintain strong performance)
- **Performance Max (Villains):** £15/day (1% - reduce during peak to prioritize winners)
- **Buffer:** £5/day (<1%)

**ROAS Strategy:**
- **Black Friday Week (Nov 25-29):** Reduce ROAS target to 195% (5% reduction)
  - Rationale: Higher conversion rates expected, increased competition requires more aggressive bidding
  - Note: As B2B business, weekend patterns may differ from B2C - maintain steady daily budgets

**Key Actions:**
- Increase Main PMax budget to £700/day on Nov 22 (ahead of peak period)
- Monitor impression share daily during Black Friday week
- Adjust ROAS targets dynamically based on conversion rate trends
- Ensure product feed GTIN accuracy (proactive monitoring)
- Maintain steady daily budgets (no weekend adjustments for B2B patterns)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Capture peak Black Friday demand (historical peak £762/day, now scaling to £1,300/day)
- Maintain ROAS above 2.00x (profitable threshold)
- Maximize revenue during highest conversion period

---

### Phase 3: Post-Black Friday Stabilization (Dec 1-15)
**Objective:** Maintain momentum while optimizing efficiency

**Daily Budget Allocation (£1,300/day total):**
- **Main Performance Max (Heroes & Sidekicks):** £820/day (63% - maintain strong allocation)
- **Shopping Campaign:** £400/day (31% - maintain to address impression loss)
- **Search Brand Campaign:** £60/day (5% - maintain strong performance)
- **Performance Max (Villains):** £15/day (1% - maintain conservative)
- **Buffer:** £5/day (<1%)

**ROAS Strategy:**
- Return ROAS target to 205% (pre-Black Friday level)
- Monitor performance vs. Black Friday period
- If conversion rates remain elevated (>2.3%), maintain 200% target

**Key Actions:**
- Evaluate Black Friday performance vs. targets
- Optimize based on learnings from peak period
- Maintain steady daily budgets (B2B patterns may differ from B2C)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Maintain strong revenue post-Black Friday
- Optimize efficiency as conversion rates normalize
- Capture Christmas shopping demand (Dec 15-25 period)

---

### Phase 4: Christmas Shopping Period (Dec 16-31)
**Objective:** Capture final holiday shopping demand

**Daily Budget Allocation (£1,300/day total):**
- **Main Performance Max (Heroes & Sidekicks):** £830/day (64% - maintain strong allocation)
- **Shopping Campaign:** £400/day (31% - maintain to address impression loss)
- **Search Brand Campaign:** £55/day (4% - maintain strong performance)
- **Performance Max (Villains):** £12/day (1% - maintain conservative)
- **Buffer:** £3/day (<1%)

**ROAS Strategy:**
- Maintain 205% target (or 200% if conversion rates remain >2.3%)
- Monitor daily for delivery deadline queries (Dec 20-23)
- Consider slight reduction (to 200%) if conversion rates spike

**Key Actions:**
- Monitor for delivery deadline queries (peak Dec 20-23)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Capture Christmas shopping demand (scaling from historical £229-248/day)
- Maintain profitability through holiday period
- Set up strong start for January

## ROAS Target Strategy

### Current vs. Target ROAS

| Period | Current Target | Recommended Target | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Pre-BF (Nov 12-21) | 205% | 205% | Maintain current performance, monitor trends |
| Black Friday Week | 205% | 195% | Higher conversion rates, increased competition |
| Post-BF (Dec 1-15) | 205% | 205% | Return to baseline, optimize efficiency |
| Christmas (Dec 16-31) | 205% | 200-205% | Maintain or slight reduction if conversion rates spike |

### ROAS Monitoring Protocol

**Daily Monitoring:**
- Check overall account ROAS vs. target
- Monitor conversion rate trends
- Review impression share for budget-constrained campaigns

**Weekly Review:**
- Evaluate ROAS performance by campaign
- Assess if targets need adjustment
- Review search terms quality (especially AI Max)

**Decision Triggers:**
- **Reduce ROAS Target:** If conversion rate >2.3% AND impression share <95%
- **Increase ROAS Target:** If ROAS drops below 2.00x (unprofitable threshold)
- **Maintain Target:** If performance within 2.00x - 2.50x range

**ROAS Target:** 180-200% (lower due to optimization focus)

---

## Peak Period Considerations

### B2B Pattern Notes
**Rationale:** As a B2B/Trade business, weekend patterns may differ from typical B2C retail. Maintain steady daily budgets rather than dynamic weekend adjustments.

**Implementation:**
- Maintain consistent daily budgets across all days
- Monitor for any B2B-specific patterns (e.g., weekday vs. weekend differences)
- Adjust based on actual performance data rather than assumptions

### Peak Day Monitoring

**"Fake Friday" (Nov 21):**
- Monitor for early Black Friday demand (80% of BF demand, 27% cheaper CPCs)
- Maintain Phase 1 budget allocation
- Watch for conversion rate improvements

**Black Friday (Nov 28):**
- Use Phase 2 budget allocation (£1,300/day)
- Reduce ROAS target to 195% for the week
- Monitor performance closely

**Cyber Monday (Dec 1):**
- Transition to Phase 3 budget allocation
- Maintain 195% ROAS target if conversion rates remain high

## Notes & Considerations

### B2B vs. B2C Balance
- Uno Lighting serves both trade/professional buyers and consumers (B2B/Trade focus)
- Black Friday may have stronger B2C demand than typical periods, but B2B patterns may differ
- Monitor for shifts in customer mix during peak periods
- Trade buyers may have different purchase patterns (less influenced by sales, more consistent weekday activity)
- **No weekend budget adjustments** - maintain steady daily budgets appropriate for B2B patterns

### Competition Considerations
- Increased competition during peak periods requires more aggressive bidding
- Maintaining visibility requires budget increases even if CPCs rise
- Focus on quality score and ad relevance to maintain efficiency

### Stock Planning
- At 3.00x ROAS, £1,300/day generates ~£3,900/day revenue
- Peak periods (Black Friday week) could generate £4,000-4,500/day
- Ensure stock availability for top-performing products
- Monitor product-level performance to anticipate demand
- **Important:** As B2B business, seasonal patterns may differ from typical retail - recommend conservative stock planning until we see how next 2-3 weeks perform

### Client Communication
- Weekly performance updates during peak periods
- Daily updates during Black Friday week (Nov 25-29)
- Alert immediately if ROAS drops below 2.00x
- Share learnings and optimization opportunities
