# Email Response to Dana - Product Performance & European Expansion

**Date:** 25 November 2025
**To:** Dana Lu (danalu@savelightuk.com)
**From:** Peter Empson
**Subject:** Re: Products Performace
**Status:** Draft ready for review

---

## Email Context

Dana sent a list of 20 underperforming products (Excel attachment) with two main requests:
1. Boost visibility for declining products (especially Chloe CCT marker - former top 5 seller)
2. Expand to European markets

---

## Key Points Covered in Response

### Product Performance Analysis
- **Commitment:** Will analyse all 20 products and boost where possible
- **Timing caveat:** Quiet period approaching Christmas - unlikely to see movement until January
- **Action:** Analyse decline (impressions, clicks, conversions, feed status)

### European Expansion - Reality Check
- **Not a simple switch:** Locations are set at campaign level, can't add to existing campaigns
- **Requires significant infrastructure:**
  - Multi-currency Shopify setup (€ pricing)
  - European shipping configuration
  - New Google Merchant Centre feed with Euro currency
  - New Shopping/PMax campaigns for European markets
  - Country-specific availability and pricing

### Recommended Approach
1. **Data first:** Analyse which European countries already showing interest
2. **Pilot markets:** Start with 2-3 promising countries
3. **Phased rollout:** Get infrastructure right before scaling
4. **Q1 2026 project:** Better suited for New Year implementation

### Next Steps
- **This week:** Product performance analysis + international traffic data
- **Q1 2026:** European expansion proposal if desired

## Notes for Future Reference

- **Dana's knowledge level:** Not massively knowledgeable on Google Ads technical details
- **Richard's role:** Strategy decisions - will need his input on European expansion
- **Dana's role:** Day-to-day operations and product management
- **Communication style:** Keep explanations clear and non-technical, use analogies where helpful
