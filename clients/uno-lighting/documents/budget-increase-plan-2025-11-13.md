## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Black Friday Testing (Nov 13-21)
**Objective:** Establish £1,800/day spend and test campaign performance before peak

**Suggested Allocation (£1,800/day total):**
| Campaign | Suggested Budget | % of Total | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| **Main PMax (H&S)** | £1,100/day | 61% | Primary revenue driver with proven performance |
| **Shopping Campaign** | £550/day | 31% | Address 34% impression share loss |
| **Search Brand** | £120/day | 7% | Strong 3x ROAS performer with AI Max |
| **PMax Villains** | £30/day | 2% | New customer acquisition test |
| **TOTAL** | **£1,800/day** | 100% | |

**ROAS Strategy:**
- Maintain current 205% target initially
- Monitor conversion rate trends daily
- If conversion rates improve >2.3%, consider gradual reduction to 195%

**Key Actions:**
1. Increase Main PMax budget to £1,100/day
2. Increase Shopping budget to £550/day (addresses 34% impression loss)
3. Increase Brand campaign to £120/day (capitalize on 3x ROAS performance)
4. Monitor daily spend and ROAS performance
5. Verify product feed GTIN accuracy before Black Friday

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Capture "Fake Friday" demand (Nov 21) - 80% of BF demand at 27% lower CPCs
- Build campaign learning data before Black Friday peak
- Test £1,800/day spend level
- Target 300%+ ROAS

---

### Phase 2: Black Friday Peak (Nov 22-30)
**Objective:** Maximize revenue during highest demand period

**Suggested Allocation (£1,800/day total):**

| **Shopping Campaign** | £500/day | 28% | Maintain strong presence |
| **Search Brand** | £90/day | 5% | Protect brand terms |
| **PMax Villains** | £10/day | <1% | Reduce during peak |
| **TOTAL** | **£1,800/day** | 100% | |

**ROAS Strategy:**
- **Black Friday Week (Nov 25-29):** Consider reducing ROAS target to 195% (if conversion rates support it)
- Rationale: Higher conversion rates expected, increased competition requires competitive bidding
- Monitor daily and adjust based on actual performance

**Key Actions:**
1. Adjust budgets on Nov 22 (ahead of peak)
2. Monitor impression share daily during Black Friday week
3. Adjust ROAS targets dynamically based on conversion rate trends
4. Ensure product feed accuracy maintained

**Expected Outcomes:**

| **Shopping Campaign** | £540/day | 30% |
| **Search Brand** | £100/day | 6% |
| **PMax Villains** | £10/day | <1% |
| **TOTAL** | **£1,800/day** | 100% |

**ROAS Strategy:**
