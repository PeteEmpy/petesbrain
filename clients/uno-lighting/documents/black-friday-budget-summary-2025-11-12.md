## Overview

This plan outlines how we'll utilize the £1,300/day total budget to capitalize on Black Friday traffic while maintaining strong profitability. The strategy is phased to align with traffic patterns and includes specific budget allocations, ROAS targets, and monitoring protocols. Budgets are maintained steady daily (no weekend adjustments) appropriate for B2B patterns.

---

## Key Strategy Points

### 1. Phased Budget Allocation
- **Pre-Black Friday (Nov 12-21):** Build momentum, capture "Fake Friday" demand
- **Black Friday Week (Nov 22-30):** Maximize revenue during peak period
- **Post-Black Friday (Dec 1-15):** Maintain momentum, optimize efficiency
- **Christmas Period (Dec 16-31):** Capture final holiday shopping demand

### 2. Campaign Prioritization
- **Main Performance Max:** Largest budget allocation (£800-850/day - 62-65% of total)
  - *Note: Current budget is £1,200/day - reduced to fit within £1,300/day total*
- **Shopping Campaign:** Address 34% impression loss (£380-400/day - 29-31% of total)
  - *Note: Current budget is £670/day - reduced to fit within £1,300/day total*
- **Search Brand:** Maintain strong performance (£50-70/day - 4-5% of total)
- **Villains Campaign:** Enable new customer acquisition (£12-25/day - 1-2% of total)

### 3. ROAS Target Management
- **Current:** 205% (maintain through Nov 21)
- **Black Friday Week:** 195% (5% reduction for peak competition)
- **Post-BF:** Return to 205% (or maintain 200% if conversion rates remain high)

### 4. B2B Pattern Considerations
- **Steady Daily Budgets:** No weekend adjustments (B2B patterns may differ from B2C)
- **"Fake Friday" (Nov 21):** Monitor for early demand (80% of BF demand, 27% cheaper CPCs)
- **Black Friday (Nov 28):** Use Phase 2 allocation, reduce ROAS to 195%
- **Cyber Monday (Dec 1):** Transition to Phase 3 allocation
