## Strategic Context

### Current Strategy (Updated Nov 13, 2025)

**Campaign Structure**:
- Performance Max campaigns (main revenue driver)
- Search Brand campaigns (with AI Max enabled Oct 2025)
- Shopping campaigns via Google Merchant Center
- Multiple PMax campaigns running simultaneously

**Budget & Spend**:
- **Total Budget Target (Approved):** £1,800/day (£500 increase agreed Nov 12, 2025 via WhatsApp)
- **Current Actual Spend:** £900-1,070/day (increased from historical £549/day)
- **Current Status (Nov 13, 2025):** NOT budget-limited
  - Budget lost impression share: ~0% (not constraining performance)
  - Rank lost impression share: Primary constraint (auction competition)
  - **Strategy:** Monitor daily - implement £500/day increase ONLY when budget constraint appears
  - **Trigger:** When budget lost IS rises above 10% consistently OR when peak demand drives spend to current limits
- **Budget Allocation:** To be determined based on campaign performance when increase is needed
  - Focus on campaigns with proven ROAS and impression share constraints
  - Main PMax (H&S), Shopping, Brand campaigns priority
  - Phased implementation through Black Friday and Christmas
- **Implementation Period:** Nov 13 - Dec 6, 2025 (Christmas delivery cutoff based on 2024 pattern)
- **Expected Revenue:** £130k total at 300% target ROAS (when full budget utilized)
- **Weekly Tracking:** Automated in weekly summary email (Mondays) - tracks spend vs target, ROAS, progress (Day X of 24)

**Bidding Strategy**:
- Target ROAS: Currently 205% (reduced from 215% on Oct 15, 2025 - 10% reduction)
- Black Friday Week (Nov 25-29): Planned reduction to 195% during peak demand
- Focus on ROAS optimization over pure volume
- Portfolio bid strategies in use
- Willing to adjust ROAS targets seasonally to capitalize on peak periods

**Key Focus Areas**:
1. ROAS optimization while maintaining growth
2. Product feed optimization (GTIN management, bulk quantity variants)
3. AI/machine learning preparedness (ChatGPT shopping, AI-driven search)
4. Conversion rate optimization (particularly mobile)
5. Customer lifetime value and retention improvement

### Why This Approach?

**ROAS-Focused Growth**: Client has demonstrated strong 143% YoY revenue growth (first 5 months of 2025) while maintaining stable ROAS. This suggests:
- Conservative approach to spending that prioritizes profitability
- Business has cash flow considerations that require sustainable returns
- Room for strategic ROAS reduction during peak conversion periods to capture more volume

**Technical Product Focus**: B2B/Trade business selling specialized LED components requires:
- Accurate technical data (CRI, IP ratings, CCT, wattage, etc.) in product feeds
- Educational content for professional buyers (designers, electricians, architects)
- E-E-A-T optimization for technical credibility

**AI Preparedness**: Proactive approach to AI-driven shopping (ChatGPT, Google AIO) reflects forward-thinking strategy:
- Structured data optimization underway
- Technical content creation prioritized
- Focus on being "definitive technical expert" for AI recommendations

### Goals & KPIs

**Primary Goal**: Revenue Growth with Strong ROAS
**Current ROAS Target**: 205% (reduced Oct 2025)
**Historical ROAS Performance**:
- Best: 4.11x (February 2025)
- Typical range: 2.50x - 3.50x
- Profitable at 2.00x+

**Other KPIs**:
- Conversion Rate: Peak at 3.45% (Feb 2025), typical 2.0-2.5%
- Customer Return Rate: Currently >21% (up 30% YoY), target 25-30%
- Revenue Growth: +57.7% YTD (through Oct 2025 vs 2024)
- Daily Spend: £549/day (Oct 2025), up from £417/day (Oct 2024) = 1.32x growth

**Q4 2025 Strategy**: Proposed 25% ROAS reduction during peak conversion months (Oct-Nov) to capture £27,645 in incremental profit

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Critical: Conversion Lag Effect (Nov 2025)

**⚠️ ALWAYS account for 1-2 day conversion lag when analyzing recent performance:**

- **Nov 11-12 Analysis (Nov 13, 2025)**: Account showed apparent performance decline when analyzed by click date
  - Click date ROAS: 116-165% (appeared to be failing)
  - Conversion date ROAS: 172-234% (actual performance was strong)
  - Conversion lag: 26-66% of conversions come 1-2 days after click

- **Impact on Analysis**:
  - Recent 2-3 days ALWAYS look artificially worse than reality
  - Conversion rate appears to drop when it's actually stable or improving
  - ROAS appears to decline when it's actually meeting/exceeding targets

- **Correct Analysis Method**:
  - Use `conversions_by_conversion_date` metric (not `conversions`)
  - Use `conversions_value_by_conversion_date` (not `conversions_value`)
  - Allow 2-3 days for data to mature before drawing conclusions
  - Compare week-over-week using conversion date attribution

- **Example**: Nov 6-12 performance
  - By click date: 1.64% CR, 137% ROAS ❌ (FALSE - data not mature)
  - By conversion date: 2.30% CR, 224% ROAS ✅ (TRUE - actual performance)

**This is NOT a seasonal anomaly - this is the normal attribution pattern for this account.**

### What Works Well

**ROAS Optimization**:
- Strategic ROAS reductions during peak conversion periods (>2.3%) drives profitable growth
- Feb 2025 proved high conversion rates (3.45%) support aggressive targeting
- Portfolio bid strategies effective for managing multiple campaigns

**Product Feed Strategy**:
- Proactive GTIN monitoring prevents disapprovals
- Custom rules preserve product performance history during variant creation
- Clear quantity labeling in titles improves CTR

**Campaign Structure**:
- Performance Max as primary revenue driver
- AI Max on Search Brand (enabled Oct 21, 2025) - monitoring for impression expansion
- Multiple PMax campaigns allow for product-line segmentation

**Client Relationship**:
- Detailed strategic reports (CRO, CLV, AI preparedness, Q4 forecasts) build trust
- Proactive recommendations lead to quick implementation
- Data-driven approach resonates with client

### What Doesn't Work

**Aggressive Scaling Without ROAS Balance**:
- Client prefers sustainable, profitable growth over pure volume
- Cash flow considerations require maintained ROAS

**Product Page Complexity**:
- Single-quantity pages perform better in some cases than multi-variant pages
- Must evaluate sales history before consolidating products (Feb 2025 analysis)
- WiFi GU10 was only product with enough traction to warrant preserving product ID

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Oct 15, 2025 | Decreased target ROAS by 10% on main PMax campaigns (from 215% to 205%) | [Monitoring] Expected to increase impression volume while maintaining profitability | In progress - evaluate after 2-4 weeks |
| Oct 21, 2025 | Switched on AI Max for Search Brand campaign | [Monitoring] Hypothesis: Will expand impression availability | Check search terms in 2 weeks (early Nov) |
| Oct 1, 2025 | Product description optimization test (front-load benefits before disclaimers) | [Pending] Proposed test for COB LED Strip | Awaiting client implementation |
| July 2025 | Banbury quantity break pricing implementation | [Success] Bulk pricing structure in feed | Product feed rules created to handle 1pc/5pcs/10pcs variants |
| Feb 2025 | Product variant consolidation analysis | [Success] Data-driven decision on which products to preserve | WiFi GU10 preserved; others consolidated to new pages |

### Failed Tests (Learn From)

| Date | Test Description | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| [No failures documented yet] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

**Note**: Client has been responsive to recommendations, and most tests have been implemented thoughtfully with monitoring periods built in.

- CRO optimization can improve performance even before major redesign

## Notes for Future Analysis

**Data Gaps to Fill**:
1. Google Ads Account ID and campaign list
2. Google Analytics Property ID
3. Average Order Value and margin data
4. Detailed campaign structure and budget allocations
5. Competitor landscape research
6. Historical ROAS/conversion data by campaign
7. Customer segmentation data (trade vs consumer mix)

**Strategic Questions to Explore**:
1. What's the optimal ROAS target by season/month based on conversion rate data?
2. Can we segment PMax by product category for better control? (May already be doing this)
3. What's the trade vs consumer revenue mix and should targeting differ?
4. How can we accelerate customer retention toward 25-30% goal?
5. What's the impact of AI Max on Search Brand after 2-4 weeks?
6. Should we consider Demand Gen for designer/trade audience prospecting?

**Strategic Opportunities**:
1. **Q4 ROAS Optimization**: Implement gradual ROAS reduction during peak conversion periods
2. **AI Preparedness**: Structured data, technical content, E-E-A-T optimization
3. **Customer Retention**: Email marketing, loyalty program, trade account benefits
4. **Mobile CRO**: Quick wins before major website redesign
5. **Designer Outreach**: Case studies, testimonials, professional partnerships
6. **Product Feed Excellence**: Continue proactive monitoring and optimization

### [Uno Lighting] Monitor campaigns for budget increase readiness (£1,800/day approved, waiting for capacity)
<!-- task_id: eVM1NmVvd1JyWTdPV2FfTw -->
**Status:** 📋 In Progress  

---
**Source:** Client Agreement (2025-11-12)
**Client:** uno-lighting
**Priority:** P2 (Monitoring - not urgent)
**Time Estimate:** 45 mins
**Reason:** Richard agreed to full £500/day budget increase via WhatsApp on Nov 12. Implementation deferred until campaigns show budget constraint.
---

**UPDATE (2025-11-14):** No capacity yet in campaigns to accommodate new budget. Need to check again Tuesday next week.

**STRATEGY (2025-11-13):** Monitor daily - implement £500/day increase ONLY when budget constraint appears
- **Current Status:** NOT budget-limited (0% budget lost impression share)
- **Trigger:** When budget lost IS rises above 10% consistently OR peak demand drives spend to limits
- **Current Spend:** £900-1,070/day (has room to grow before hitting £1,300 limit)

**Budget Allocation (when triggered):**
- Main PMax: Increase budget (pending capacity)
- Shopping: Increase to address 34% impression loss (pending capacity)
- Brand: Maintain strong 3x ROAS performance
- Villains: Enable new customer acquisition (pending capacity)

**Expected Revenue:** £5,400/day at 300% ROAS = £130k (Nov 13 - Dec 6)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review campaign capacity Tuesday Nov 19
2. Check budget lost impression share
3. Update campaign budgets if capacity confirmed
4. Monitor daily spend and ROAS
5. Alert client if ROAS drops below 200%
6. Confirm implementation to Richard via WhatsApp
