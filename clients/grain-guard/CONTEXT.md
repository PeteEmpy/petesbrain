---

## Strategic Context

### **⭐ CORE STRATEGY: Product Hero Segmentation Framework**

**CRITICAL FOR AUDIT ANALYSIS**: Grain Guard uses the **Product Hero label system** as its primary campaign segmentation strategy. This is NOT traditional product category segmentation.

**What This Means:**
- Campaigns are structured by **performance labels** (Heroes & Sidekicks, Villains), not product types
- Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs labels to Google Merchant Center
- Campaign names "H&S" and "Villains" refer to Product Hero performance tiers, not product categories
- This strategy is consistent across all Connor Heaps businesses (Grain Guard, Go Glean, Crowd Control)

**Analysis Implications:**
- Budget allocation should consider label-based performance patterns (Heroes typically outperform Villains)
- Campaign ROAS targets may differ by label tier (Heroes can sustain higher targets)
- Product movement between labels (Hero → Villain or vice versa) will shift campaign performance
- Traditional product category analysis may miss the performance-based segmentation logic

**Product Hero Label System Details:**
- **Heroes & Sidekicks**: Top-performing wood care products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains**: Underperforming products that drain budget but have optimization potential
- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions (not currently in active campaigns)
- **Plan Level**: Active Product Hero subscription

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Structure**: Performance Max and Shopping campaigns with **Product Hero label segmentation**
- **Bidding Strategy**: Target ROAS (140-160% range, progressive increases from 120%)
- **Key Focus Areas**: Product Hero label optimization (Heroes & Sidekicks, Villains), wood care product performance

**Active Campaigns**:
1. "GGU | P Max | H&S Full 120 8/7 130 4/8 140 9/9 Shopping Only 11/9 160 15/10" - PMax with ROAS progression and shopping-only test
2. "GGU | Shopping | Villains 120 130 4/8 140 9/9" - Shopping campaign with ROAS increases

**Campaign Naming Analysis**:
- "GGU" = Grain Guard UK (likely)
- "H&S" = Heroes & Sidekicks (Product Hero label segment - top performers)
- "Villains" = Product Hero label segment (underperformers that need optimization)
- Numbers (120, 130, 140, 160) = Target ROAS percentages
- Dates (8/7, 4/8, 9/9, 11/9, 15/10) = Date when ROAS target was changed
- **ROAS Trend**: Increasing targets (120% → 160%), opposite of CCC UK's decreasing trend
- "Shopping Only 11/9" = Switched to shopping-only on Sept 11

**Product Hero Label System**:
- **Heroes & Sidekicks (H&S)**: Top-performing products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains**: Underperforming products that drain budget but have potential for improvement
- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions (not currently in active campaigns)
- Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs labels to Google Merchant Center
- Campaigns are structured around these labels to optimize budget allocation and bidding strategy

### Why This Approach?
**Product Hero Segmentation Strategy**: Using Product Hero label system (same methodology as other ROK clients):
- Automatically classifies products based on performance (Heroes, Sidekicks, Villains, Zombies)
- Allows separate ROAS targets per performance segment
- Optimizes budget allocation toward top performers (H&S) while managing underperformers (Villains)
- Enables strategic campaign structure aligned with product performance

**ROAS Progression (Improving Performance)**:
- Started at 120% (July), now at 160% (Oct) for H&S
- Indicates strengthening performance or optimization success
- Opposite trajectory from CCC UK (which reduced targets)

**"Shopping Only" Adjustment (Sept 11)**:
- Changed from full PMax to shopping-only
- Suggests testing channel effectiveness or budget allocation

### Goals & KPIs
**Primary Goal**: [TBD]
**Target ROAS**: 140-160% (increasing trend)
**Target CPA**: [TBD]
**Other KPIs**: [TBD]

**Performance Observation**:
- ROAS targets increasing month-over-month (positive sign)
- Currently at 160% for H&S campaign (strong performance)
- Villains campaign at 140%

- Kitchen trends (wooden chopping boards, utensils)

### Year-Over-Year Trends

## Key Learnings & Insights

### What Works Well
**Improving ROAS Targets** (Positive Signal):
- H&S campaign: 120% → 130% → 140% → 160% (July to Oct)
- Villains campaign: 120% → 130% → 140%
- Indicates strong optimization success or improving market conditions

### What Doesn't Work
[TBD]

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Sept 11, 2025 | Switched H&S PMax to "Shopping Only" | [TBD - monitor results] | Assess channel performance |
| July-Oct 2025 | Progressive ROAS target increases | Strong performance, reached 160% | Continue monitoring |

**Test Progression** (H&S Campaign):
- July 8: 120% ROAS target (baseline)
- Aug 4: Increased to 130% (+10 points)
- Sept 9: Increased to 140% (+10 points)
- Sept 11: Switched to "Shopping Only"
- Oct 15: Increased to 160% (+20 points)

**Key Insight**: Consistent ROAS target increases suggest strong, improving performance. The Sept 11 "shopping only" change didn't disrupt growth - Oct increase to 160% shows continued confidence.

## Campaign-Specific Notes

### Campaign: GGU | P Max | H&S Full
- **Type**: Performance Max (switched to Shopping-only Sept 11)
- **Merchant ID**: 5354444061
- **ROAS History**: 120% (Jul 8) → 130% (Aug 4) → 140% (Sept 9) → Shopping Only (Sept 11) → 160% (Oct 15)
- **Pattern**: Strong performance improvement, aggressive target increases
- **Current State**: "Shopping Only" mode at 160% ROAS

### Campaign: GGU | Shopping | Villains
- **Type**: Shopping (Standard)
- **Merchant ID**: 5354444061
- **ROAS History**: 120% → 130% (Aug 4) → 140% (Sept 9)
- **Pattern**: Following same progression as H&S but at lower targets (140% vs 160%)
- **Implication**: H&S products outperforming Villains by 20 ROAS points

**Questions to Investigate**:
1. Why is H&S outperforming Villains? (Better products, higher margins, more demand?)
2. Why switch PMax to "Shopping Only"? (Performance, budget, Google's recommendation?)
3. Can Villains campaign reach 160% ROAS with optimization?

## Product Hero Settings

### Current Configuration (Last Updated: 2025-10-15)

**Product Hero Plan**: Pro Plan (€30/month)

**Campaign ROAS Targets**:
- **H&S Full (Heroes & Sidekicks)**: 160%
- **Villains**: 140%

**Performance Gap**: H&S outperforming Villains by 20 ROAS points

**Rationale**: Systematic ROAS increases (120% → 130% → 140% → 160% for H&S) based on strong performance improvements. H&S campaign switched to "Shopping Only" mode on Sept 11. Lower target for Villains reflects inherent underperformance of this product segment.

### Settings Change History

| Date | Campaign | Setting | Previous | New | Rationale | Result |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-15 | H&S Full | ROAS | 140% | 160% | Strong performance allows aggressive target | Current - Shopping Only mode |
| 2025-09-11 | H&S Full | Campaign Type | PMax | Shopping Only | [TBD - investigate reason] | At 160% ROAS |
| 2025-09-09 | H&S Full | ROAS | 130% | 140% | Performance improvement | Further increased to 160% |
| 2025-09-09 | Villains | ROAS | 130% | 140% | Performance improvement | Current target |
| 2025-08-04 | H&S Full | ROAS | 120% | 130% | Performance improvement | Further increased |
| 2025-08-04 | Villains | ROAS | 120% | 130% | Performance improvement | Further increased to 140% |
| 2025-07-08 | H&S Full | ROAS | [TBD] | 120% | Initial campaign setup | Progressive increases began |

**Note**: Product Hero automatically classifies products daily as Heroes/Sidekicks/Villains/Zombies based on performance. These labels sync to Google Merchant Center and guide campaign structure. Target ROAS settings control the algorithm's bidding aggressiveness. Part of Connor Heaps portfolio (consistent with Go Glean, Crowd Control).
