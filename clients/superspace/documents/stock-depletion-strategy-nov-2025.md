# Superspace Stock Depletion Strategy - November 2025

**Date Created:** November 18, 2025
**Status:** Active
**Review Date:** Weekly (or as stock depletes)

---

## Executive Summary

With Christmas stock depleting rapidly across all markets (US ~10 days, UK/AU also low), strategy pivoted from volume maximization to profitability optimization. Target ROAS increased from 550% to 600% across all markets to slow spend, increase margins, and extend stock availability through peak season.

Post-Christmas, products will continue selling with delivery after Christmas, which will impact conversion rates but allows continued revenue generation.

## Stock Situation (Nov 18, 2025)

### Current Status by Market

**United States:**
- ~10 days of Christmas stock remaining (per Ant, Nov 18)
- Selling at accelerated pace after budget increases (Nov 13: £5k/day → £12k/day)
- Running 1,199% actual ROAS (well above 550% target)

**United Kingdom:**
- Stock levels "low" (per Nov 17 conversation)
- Running 1,081% actual ROAS on Shopping campaign

### Post-Depletion Plan

Once Christmas stock depletes:

- **Strategy**: Keep campaigns running to maintain momentum and capture late buyers
- Reverse ROAS increases in January to push remaining inventory

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Increase Target ROAS?

1. **Slow Stock Depletion**: Higher ROAS = less aggressive bidding = fewer conversions = extend stock availability
2. **Increase Profitability**: Campaigns running 1,199% actual ROAS (2x above target) - plenty of headroom to increase targets
3. **Protect Margins**: With limited stock, maximize profit per unit sold rather than volume
4. **Maintain Momentum**: Keep campaigns running (don't pause) to preserve algorithm learning and audience signals

### Why Not Reduce Budgets Instead?

- **ROAS increases are more surgical**: Algorithms optimize for efficiency, naturally slowing spend
- **Preserves learning**: Budgets stay high, campaign momentum maintained
- **Easier to reverse**: Can drop ROAS back down in January without re-learning period
- **Better quality traffic**: Higher ROAS targets = better converting customers only

### Post-Christmas Strategy (January 2026)

1. **Reverse ROAS increases**: 600% → back to 550% (or lower to 495% per original Q4 plan)
2. **Messaging shift**: Emphasize "Delivery January" clearly on website
3. **Monitor conversion rate impact**: Expect 20-30% drop in CVR initially
4. **Budget adjustments**: May need to increase budgets to compensate for CVR drop
5. **Maintain spend levels**: Goal is to clear remaining inventory and keep sales momentum

## Expected Impact

### Short-Term (Nov 18-30)

**Positive:**
- ✅ Slower stock depletion (extend availability through peak season)
- ✅ Higher profit margins per sale
- ✅ Better CPA (lower cost per acquisition)
- ✅ Maintain campaign learning and momentum

**Neutral/Negative:**
- ⚠️ Lower daily conversion volume (intentional)
- ⚠️ Reduced daily revenue (intentional)
- ⚠️ Possible impression share loss (acceptable trade-off)

### Long-Term (Post-Christmas)

**When Selling "Delivery After Christmas":**
- ⚠️ Lower conversion rates expected (customers prefer pre-Christmas)
- ⚠️ May need to reduce ROAS targets again to maintain volume
- ✅ Continued revenue generation (vs pausing completely)
- ✅ Algorithm learning preserved
- ✅ Customer momentum maintained into January

## Monitoring & Adjustment Plan

### Weekly Review Metrics

Track these metrics weekly (or more frequently as stock depletes):

1. **Stock Levels**: Days remaining for each market
2. **Daily Conversion Volume**: Are we slowing enough?
3. **Actual ROAS**: Still above target? Room for more increases?
4. **CPA Performance**: Staying below £50 target?
5. **Conversion Rate**: Any unusual drops?

### Adjustment Triggers

**If stock depleting too fast (< 7 days remaining):**
- Increase ROAS targets further (600% → 650% or 700%)
- Consider temporary budget reductions as additional brake

**If stock depleting too slow (> 14 days remaining):**
- Reduce ROAS targets back down (600% → 550%)
- Maximize revenue during peak season window

**If conversion rate drops significantly (> 20% drop):**
- Investigate messaging on website (is "Delivery After Christmas" clear?)
- Consider ROAS reductions to compensate
- Monitor for technical issues or competitor activity

## Communication History

### Email Thread Summary (Nov 17-18, 2025)

**Nov 18, 8:24 AM** - Ant Erwin:
> "Now that we're racing ahead in sales it does look like we might sell out of US Xmas stock in around 10 days so let's not increase budget further. We might have to reduce slightly soon but let's see how it goes."

**Nov 18, 9:18 AM** - Ant Erwin (re: increasing target ROAS):
> "Yes sure, if you think that would make ad spend more efficient and return a better ROAS?"

**Nov 17, 10:14 PM** - Peter to Ant:
> "What's the run rate looking like for the UK and Australia? Is it worth increasing the target ROAS for them as well?"

**Context:**
- US budget increased Nov 13 from £5k/day to £12k/day
- Performance excellent: 1,199% actual ROAS (vs 550% target)
- Stock warning prompted strategic pivot to profitability focus
