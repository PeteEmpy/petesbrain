# Superspace - Budget Increase Action Points
**Date**: 2025-11-06
**Source**: Email from Craig Spencer

## Context from Craig's Email

**Overall Performance:**
- MER improved from 22-25% (late Oct) to 14% (current) - excellent progress
- Nov 1st marked a significant step change in sales (delayed Christmas shopping finally kicked in)
- Facebook ads performance vastly improving alongside Google

**Stock Situation:**
- **US**: Strong stock coverage - planned for ~14k Big Set sales in November
  - Good number on-hand in warehouse
  - Rest on or nearly on water (arrival timing is critical - "can be a lottery this time of year")
- **UK**: Now showing early-mid December shipping on website
  - Facebook ads flying - will likely sell through Christmas stock by end of November at current spend levels
  - Undercooked stocks (insufficient inventory)
- **Australia**: Now showing early-mid December shipping on website
  - Craig suggests 40-50% Google Ads increase

## Action Points

### 1. US Market - Significant Budget Increase
**Action**: Increase budgets significantly
**Rationale**:
- Strong stock coverage (14k Big Set sales planned)
- Nov 1st step change confirms peak window timing
- Part of Q4 ROAS reduction strategy (550% → 380% progressively)
**Risk**: Shipments on water - need to monitor arrival timing
**Monitoring**: Watch for any delay signals from Craig

### 2. Australia - 40-50% Budget Increase
**Action**: Increase spend by 40-50%
**Rationale**:
- December delivery window creates opportunity
- Craig's specific recommendation
**Status**: Implement today

### 3. UK - Keep Budgets Tight
**Action**: Maintain reduced budgets (keep lean)
**Rationale**:
- Facebook ads "flying" - doing heavy lifting
- Will sell through by end of November regardless
- Undercooked stock situation
- Preserve inventory for Facebook channel (performing better)
**Current State**: Already reduced 50% (£395/day → £197/day on Oct 21)

## Key Insights

1. **Channel Performance**: Facebook outperforming Google in UK market - smart to preserve stock for best-performing channel
2. **Timing Validation**: The 2-3 week delay in Christmas shopping that we predicted is confirmed by Nov 1st step change
3. **MER Success**: Overall marketing efficiency improving significantly (14% vs 22-25%)
4. **Stock Risk**: US shipments "on or nearly on water" - timing critical for peak season
5. **Q4 Strategy Execution**: Now implementing the ROAS reduction strategy mapped out in early October

## Follow-up Required

- **No call needed** - Craig happy to proceed with budget increases
- **Monitor US shipment arrivals** - be ready to dial back if delays occur
- **Watch UK Facebook performance** - ensure Google stays lean to preserve stock
- **Track Australia performance** - new 40-50% increase to be monitored
