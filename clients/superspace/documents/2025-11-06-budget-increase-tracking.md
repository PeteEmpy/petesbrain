## Q4 ROAS REDUCTION STRATEGY (Oct 2025)

**Original Strategy Document**: Sent Oct 7, 2025
**Objective**: Reduce ROAS from 550% to 380% progressively to maximize volume during peak season
**Target CPA**: £50 blended across all markets
**Method**: Maximum 10% ROAS changes to avoid triggering algorithm learning phases

**Key Strategy Points:**
- Progressive ROAS reduction starting mid-November
- Aim for audience building during peak shopping season
- Accept lower short-term profitability for long-term customer acquisition
- Responsive to stock situation - can increase ROAS back if stock gets tight
- Focus on land grab and increasing audiences ready for high conversion rate period

**Unit Economics (US Market - provided to Google Accelerator Programme):**
- Average Order Value: $400
- Tax: ~6%
- Gross Margin: 43%
- Shipping: $20 (Big Set) / $15 (Rectangles) / $12 (Squares)
- Return Rate: <1% actual returns
- Repeat Purchase Rate: 18.5% (12-month period)
- Target CPA: £50

**Budget Increase Timing:**
- Budget increases implemented Nov 6, 2025
- Aligns with mid-November ROAS reduction schedule
- Nov 1st step change validated delayed shopping timing (2-3 weeks later than 2024)

## TRACKING METRICS

### What to Monitor (Weekly Comparison)

**US Market (Primary Focus):**
- Daily spend vs baseline (£2,676/day)
- Conversions vs baseline (75.7/day on Nov 5)
- Conversion value vs baseline (£25,943/day on Nov 5)
- ROAS maintenance around 500-550% target
- Stock warnings from Craig (shipments on water - timing critical)

**Australia Market:**
- Daily spend increase (40-50% target from baseline)
- Conversion rate as budget scales
- ROAS performance vs UK/US markets
- December delivery window opportunity

**UK Market (Control Group):**
- Maintain current spend levels (~£200/day)
- Watch for Facebook cannibalizing Google performance
- Ensure doesn't exceed stock constraints (sell-through by end Nov)

## RISK FACTORS TO WATCH

1. **US Shipments Delayed**: Shipments "on or nearly on water" - monitor Craig's updates
2. **UK Facebook Dominance**: Keep Google lean to preserve stock for FB
3. **Algorithm Learning**: Avoid large bid strategy changes that trigger learning
4. **Over-spending vs Stock**: Monitor daily run rate against 14k Big Set inventory

## COMPARISON PERIODS

**Baseline Period**: Oct 22 - Nov 5 (post initial budget cut)
- US: £2,676/day avg
- UK: £197/day avg
- AU: Unknown (heavily reduced)

**Test Period**: Nov 6 - Dec 4 (4 weeks to measure impact)

**Peak Period**: Nov 25 - Dec 1 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week)

## NOTES

**Q4 Strategy Execution:**
- Budget increases (Nov 6) + ROAS reductions (mid-Nov start) = coordinated Q4 strategy
- Strategy mapped out Oct 7, 2025 - now in implementation phase
- Max 10% ROAS changes to avoid learning phases
- Aiming for £50 blended CPA with increased volume
- Audience building focus for long-term customer acquisition

**Current Performance Context:**
- Nov 1st showed step change in sales (delayed Christmas shopping confirmed)
- MER improving from 22-25% to 14% (overall marketing efficiency)
- Facebook ads "flying" in UK - Google playing support role there
- US = 90% of revenue - primary focus for budget increase
- 14k Big Set sales planned for November (strong stock position)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Target very aggressive this year (jumped into Amazon's gap)
- Amazon off Shopping ads but still comparison search concern
- Q4 = land grab period for audience building
- CPA volatility expected week-to-week during this period
