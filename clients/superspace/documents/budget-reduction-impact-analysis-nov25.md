|------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Nov 15 | 402 | PEAK | Budget peak £14.1k/day |
| Nov 16 | 403 | +0% | Inertia from previous day |
| Nov 17 | 324 | -19% | ROAS increased to 600% |
| Nov 18 | 202 | -50% | Algorithm adjusting |
| Nov 19 | 175 | -56% | Overcorrection |

- Conversion volume successfully reduced by 39% from peak
- Nov 18-19 overcorrection (-50% to -56%) followed by stabilisation
- Target achieved: Slower order flow to preserve stock for early December replenishment

## Budget Adherence Analysis

### Budget vs Actual Spend (Nov 20-24)

| Date | Budget Target | Actual Spend | Variance | Budget Change |
|------|---------------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Nov 20 | £11,568 | £10,018 | -13% | Phase 1: -20% ROAS-weighted |
| Nov 21 | £10,397 | £9,843 | -5% | Phase 2: -10% |
| Nov 22 | £10,397 | £10,862 | +4% | Holding |
| Nov 23 | £10,397 | £11,606 | +12% | Overspend (weekend?) |
| **Nov 24** | **£9,357** | **£10,415** | **+11%** | **Phase 3: -10%** |

**Analysis:**
- Nov 24 overspend likely due to algorithm lag (budget change takes 1-2 days to settle)
- Nov 23 overspend (12%) may indicate weekend demand spike
- Overall trend: Spend declining toward target
- Expect Nov 25-26 to show full impact of £9,357/day Phase 3 target

## ROAS Performance (600% Target)

### 7-Day Blended ROAS: 991%

**Target:** 600% ROAS to slow volume
**Actual:** 991% ROAS (65% above target)

**Why ROAS is higher than target:**
1. **Algorithm conservatism**: Prioritising profitability over volume when ROAS target increases
2. **Search brand dominance**: 2917% ROAS on brand searches pulls blended average up
3. **Learning phase**: Algorithm still adjusting to 600% target (implemented Nov 17)
4. **Weekend effect**: Nov 23-24 weekend likely lower competition = higher ROAS

**Impact on stock preservation:**
- Higher ROAS = fewer orders per £ spent ✅
- Algorithm successfully throttling volume while maintaining profitability ✅
- Craig and Ant's goal achieved: Slower sales to preserve stock ✅

---

## Conclusion: Is It Working?

### ✅ Yes - Budget Reductions Are Effective

**Evidence:**

1. **Spend Reduction**: -26% from peak (£14.1k → £10.4k)
2. **Conversion Reduction**: -39% from peak (402 → 244/day)
3. **ROAS Increase**: 991% actual (target 600%) = algorithm prioritising quality over volume
4. **Budget Adherence**: Nov 24 spent £10.4k (target £9.4k) = 11% over, likely 1-day lag

**What's Working:**
- ROAS increase to 600% successfully throttling demand
- Three-phase budget reduction strategy (Nov 20, 21, 24) implemented correctly
- Algorithm adjusting to new constraints (initial overcorrection Nov 18-19, now stabilising)
- Stock preservation goal being met

**Expected Next Steps:**
- Nov 25-26: Expect spend to settle closer to £9,357/day target as algorithm fully adjusts
- Monitor daily order volume (expect ~240-280 conversions/day range)
- Early Dec: When new stock arrives, reverse strategy (reduce ROAS, increase budgets)

---

## Recommendation

**Continue current strategy - no changes needed.**

The budget reductions and ROAS increase are working exactly as Craig and Ant intended:
- Sales slowing to preserve stock ✅
- Profitability maintained (991% ROAS) ✅
- Spend declining toward target ✅

**Next Review:** Dec 2-3 to assess stock arrival timeline and plan budget ramp-up.
