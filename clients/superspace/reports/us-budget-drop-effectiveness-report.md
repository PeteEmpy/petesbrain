# Superspace US: Budget Drop Effectiveness Analysis

**Period Analysed**: Nov 13 - Dec 14, 2025
**Analysis Date**: Dec 15, 2025
**Context**: Stock depletion impacting conversion rate

---

## 🚨 Executive Summary

**The budget drops (Nov 20-24) were INEFFECTIVE at controlling spend. Stock depletion (Dec 1+) caused CATASTROPHIC performance collapse.**

### Critical Numbers

| Metric | Pre-Cuts (Nov 13-19) | Budget Cuts (Nov 20-30) | Stock Depletion (Dec 1-14) | Change (Pre → Depletion) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Daily Spend** | £12,797 | £12,994 | £9,492 | **-26%** |
| **ROAS** | 1,167% | 1,316% | **416%** | **-64%** ⚠️ |
| **Daily Conversions** | 446 | 539 | **130** | **-71%** ⚠️ |
| **CPA** | £28.39 | £24.87 | **£75.15** | **+165%** ⚠️ |

**Key Finding**: Budget cuts had minimal impact on spend (-1.5%) but stock depletion triggered 76% conversion collapse and ROAS crash from 1,316% → 416% (below 600% target).

---

## 📊 Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Pre-Budget Cuts (Nov 13-19)
**Budget Intent**: £12,010/day after Nov 13 increase

**Performance**:
- Actual Spend: £12,797/day (7% over target)
- ROAS: 1,167% (95% above 600% target)
- Conversions: 446/day
- CPA: £28.39 (43% below £50 target)

**Status**: ✅ Performing excellently, exceeding all targets

---

### Phase 2: Budget Cut Period (Nov 20-30)
**Budget Intent**:
- Nov 20: £11,568/day (-20%)
- Nov 21: £10,397/day (-10%)
- Nov 24: £9,357/day (-10%)

**Performance**:
- Actual Spend: £12,994/day (INCREASED +1.5% vs pre-cuts)
- ROAS: 1,316% (IMPROVED +149pp vs pre-cuts)
- Conversions: 539/day (INCREASED +20.9% vs pre-cuts)
- CPA: £24.87 (IMPROVED vs pre-cuts)

**Status**: ⚠️ **Budget cuts FAILED to reduce spend. Campaigns actually spent MORE because performance was excellent.**

**Why Budget Cuts Failed**:
1. Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand surge (Nov 28-30)
2. Stock still available = conversions still occurring
3. Smart Bidding optimised for ROAS, not budget constraints
4. Budget increases from Nov 13 still in learning/scaling mode

---

### Phase 3: Stock Depletion (Dec 1-14)
**Visible Stock Depleted**: Products showing on website but out of stock

**Performance**:
- Actual Spend: £9,492/day (down 27% vs budget cut period)
- ROAS: **416%** (crashed -900pp, **BELOW 600% target**)
- Conversions: **130/day** (down 76% vs budget cut period)
- CPA: **£75.15** (up 202%, **50% ABOVE £50 target**)

**Status**: 🚨 **CATASTROPHIC performance collapse due to stock depletion**

**Dec 1 Spike** (highest single day spend):
- Spend: **£22,763** (143% above planned £9,357 budget)
- ROAS: 473% (below target)
- Conversions: 360
- CPA: £63.15

This was the transition day when stock was visible but depleted - algorithms hadn't adapted yet, causing massive overspend with poor efficiency.

## 📉 Budget Drop Effectiveness Assessment

### ❌ Budget Cuts (Nov 20-24) - INEFFECTIVE

**Target**: Reduce spend by 30% (£12,010 → £9,357)
**Result**: Spend increased by 1.5% (£12,797 → £12,994)

**Effectiveness**: **0%** - Budget cuts did not achieve intended spend reduction

**Root Cause**:
- Stock availability + Black Friday demand > Budget constraints
- Smart Bidding prioritises ROAS over budget adherence when performance strong
- Budget settings are daily limits, not spend targets

---

### ✅ Stock Depletion (Dec 1+) - EFFECTIVE (But Destructive)

**Result**: Spend reduced by 27% (£12,994 → £9,492)

**Effectiveness**: Budget finally reduced, but at catastrophic cost:
- ROAS collapsed below target (416% vs 600%)
- CPA ballooned 50% above target (£75 vs £50)
- Conversion volume down 76%

**This is not a controlled throttle - this is a crash.**

## 🔍 ROAS Performance Analysis

### ROAS Timeline

| Period | ROAS | vs 600% Target |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Nov 13-19 | 1,167% | **+95%** ✅ |
| Nov 20-30 | 1,316% | **+119%** ✅ |
| Dec 1-14 | **416%** | **-31%** ❌ |
| Last 7 Days (Dec 8-14) | **426%** | **-29%** ❌ |

### ROAS Collapse Analysis

**Nov 20-30 → Dec 1-14**:
- ROAS dropped **900 percentage points** (1,316% → 416%)
- This is a **68% decline** in efficiency

**Why ROAS Crashed**:
1. **Stock depletion** = traffic hitting out-of-stock products
2. **Conversion rate collapse** = users adding to cart, finding out-of-stock at checkout
3. **CPA explosion** = paying same CPCs but getting far fewer conversions
4. **Algorithm confusion** = learning stock is depleted, reducing bid aggressiveness

**Current Status (Dec 8-14)**: ROAS stabilised around 426% but remains **29% below 600% target**

---

## 🎯 Conversion Rate Impact

### Implied Conversion Rate Changes

Assuming constant traffic quality:

| Period | Avg CPA | Implied CR Change |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Nov 13-19 | £28.39 | Baseline |
| Nov 20-30 | £24.87 | **+14%** (improving) |
| Dec 1-14 | **£75.15** | **-62%** (collapsing) |

**Stock depletion caused a ~62% drop in effective conversion rate** (based on CPA increase from £24.87 → £75.15).

This aligns with stock being visible on website but unavailable at checkout - users are clicking ads, but abandoning when they discover stock issues.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Budget Constraints Don't Work During High Performance

When ROAS is 1,167-1,316% (vs 600% target), Smart Bidding algorithms will **ignore budget constraints** to maximise profitable conversions. Budget cuts only worked when stock depletion forced performance collapse.

### 2. Stock Visibility is Critical

The Dec 1 spike (£22,763 spend, highest single day) occurred when stock was depleted but still showing as available. This caused:
- Algorithms bidding aggressively for unavailable products
- Users clicking ads but unable to complete purchase
- Massive waste (£22,763 spend for only 360 conversions = £63 CPA)

**Lesson**: When stock is depleted, **immediately pause campaigns or mark products out-of-stock in feed**.

### 3. Smart Bidding Adapts to Stock Issues (Slowly)

Dec 2-14 shows spend declining as algorithms learn stock is unavailable:
- Dec 1: £22,763 (peak waste)
- Dec 2: £15,771 (down 31%)
- Dec 3-7: £8,000-12,000 (stabilising)
- Dec 8-14: £5,000-8,000 (new baseline)

But this adaptation took **7-10 days** and cost thousands in wasted spend.

### 4. ROAS Target Increase (550% → 600%) Had Minimal Impact

Nov 17 ROAS increase was intended to slow spend, but actual ROAS Nov 20-30 was **1,316%** (far exceeding target). Target ROAS increases are ineffective when performance is strong.

---

## ⚠️ Current State Assessment (Dec 15, 2025)

**Last 7 Days (Dec 8-14)**:
- Spend: £6,536/day
- ROAS: 426% (**29% below 600% target**)
- Conversions: 91/day (down 80% from Nov peak)
- CPA: £73.73 (**47% above £50 target**)

**Status**: ⚠️ **Campaigns running at sub-target efficiency with low volume**

**Root Cause**: Stock depletion still affecting conversion rate. Products may still be showing as available but users discovering stock issues during checkout process.

## 📋 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 Hours)

1. **Verify Stock Status in Merchant Centre Feed**
   - Are out-of-stock products marked `out_of_stock` in feed?
   - Are out-of-stock products removed from Shopping campaigns?
   - Action: Update feed to reflect true stock availability

2. **Check Website Stock Messaging**
   - Are out-of-stock products showing clear messaging?
   - Are users able to add out-of-stock products to cart?
   - Action: Ensure clear stock messaging before checkout

3. **Pause Campaigns for Out-of-Stock Products**
   - If stock won't return until new inventory (early Dec mentioned in CONTEXT.md)
   - Pause Shopping/PMax campaigns entirely
   - Keep Search Brand running for brand protection
   - Action: Prevent wasted spend on unavailable products

### When Stock Returns

1. **Ramp Budgets Gradually**
   - Don't jump from £6.5k/day back to £12k/day
   - Use 3-phase approach (similar to AU plan):
     - Phase 1: £6.5k → £9k/day (+38%)
     - Phase 2: £9k → £11k/day (+22%)
     - Phase 3: £11k → target
   - 48-72 hour gaps between phases

2. **Monitor Conversion Rate Recovery**
   - Baseline CR during stock depletion: ~62% down from peak
   - Expect CR to return to Nov 13-19 levels when stock available
   - Target CPA: £28-30 (Nov 13-19 performance)
   - If CPA stays >£50 after stock returns = different issue

3. **Set ROAS Target Back to 550%**
   - Current 600% target is depressing spend
   - 550% allows more volume while maintaining profitability
   - Consider progressive reduction to 500% if stock position strong

### Prevent Future Stock Crises

1. **Stock-Responsive Campaign Automation**
   - Integrate Shopify stock levels with Google Ads
   - Auto-pause campaigns when stock <2 weeks at current run-rate
   - Auto-ramp when new inventory arrives

2. **Weekly Stock Review**
   - Every Monday: Check stock levels vs current burn rate
   - If <3 weeks stock: Reduce budgets immediately
   - Don't wait for stock depletion to force algorithmic response

3. **Budget Control via Campaign Structure**
   - Split campaigns by stock availability:
     - "In Stock - High Volume" campaigns
     - "Low Stock - Conservative" campaigns
   - Move products between campaigns based on inventory

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Budget drops (Nov 20-24) were ineffective** because performance was too strong (ROAS >1,300%) for Smart Bidding to respect budget constraints. Spend actually increased during this period due to Black Friday demand surge.

**Stock depletion (Dec 1+) achieved spend reduction** but at catastrophic cost:
- ROAS crashed from 1,316% → 416% (68% decline, below 600% target)
- CPA ballooned from £25 → £75 (3x increase, 50% above £50 target)
- Conversion volume collapsed 76%

**The "budget throttle" didn't work - stock depletion forced an emergency stop.**

**Key Learning**: Budget constraints are ineffective when campaigns are highly profitable. Stock availability is the real volume control. When stock depletes, **immediately pause campaigns or update feeds** - don't wait for algorithms to adapt (costs thousands in wasted spend).

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify current stock status and update feeds/website
2. Pause campaigns for out-of-stock products
3. Prepare 3-phase ramp plan for when stock returns
4. Implement stock-responsive automation to prevent future crises
