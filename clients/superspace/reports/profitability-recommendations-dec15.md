**Over 7 Days**:

## 🔍 **Where Are These Conversions Coming From?**

This is the critical question: If US stock is sold out with "early January" message, why are there 714 conversions in Dec 7-13?

### Possible Explanations

**1. Users Ordering for January Delivery (Most Likely)**
- Message says "Sold out for Christmas shipping early January"
- Users may be ordering now for January delivery
- This would explain why conversions are still happening
- ✅ **If this is the case, keep running - these are legitimate orders**

**2. Conversion Lag from Pre-Stock-Depletion Clicks**
- 85% of conversions occur within 1 day (CONTEXT.md)
- 15% conversion lag = ~107 conversions from earlier clicks
- But that leaves ~607 conversions unaccounted for
- ⚠️ **This doesn't fully explain the volume**

**3. UK/AU Markets Still Have Stock**
- Query shows UK campaigns running alongside US
- Some conversions may be from UK/AU, not US
- **Need to separate US-only vs other markets** (see below)

**4. Partial US Stock Available**
- Some products/sizes may still be available
- Message is general but some inventory exists
- Would explain lower conversion rate but not zero conversions

---

## 🌍 **Critical Next Step: Separate US vs UK/AU Performance**

I've queried campaign-level data for Dec 7-13. Here's what I can see:

### Campaign Names Show:
- **"SUP | US |"** campaigns (US market)
- **"SUP | UK |"** campaigns (UK market, minimal spend)
- No AU campaigns visible in this query (likely separate account or low spend)

### US Campaign Breakdown (Dec 7-13):

| Campaign Type | Daily Spend | ROAS Estimate |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Shopping Branded | £1,020 | Mixed (low 400s%) |
| P Max Brand Excluded | £1,574 | Low 300s% |
| Search Brand | £1,192 | Mid 400s% |
| Shopping Brand Excluded | £1,008 | Low-mid 400s% |
| Search Generics | £128 | Variable |
| Demand Gen | £153 | 0% (no conversions) |

**Demand Gen campaigns (£153/day) are generating ZERO conversions - pure waste.**

## 📋 **Recommendations for Craig**

### Option 1: KEEP RUNNING AS-IS (If Users Ordering for January)

**Action**: Verify that Dec 7-13 conversions are for January delivery
- Check Shopify orders from last 7 days
- Look at order notes/delivery dates
- If most orders are for January → keep running

**Rationale**:
- £6,471/day net profit is significant
- 454% ROAS is well above 233% breakeven
- Maintains campaign momentum for January restock
- Keeps brand visible during competitive period

**Risk**: Some spend may be wasted if users abandon at checkout

---

### Option 2: PAUSE DEMAND GEN CAMPAIGNS (Quick Win)

**Action**: Pause these campaigns immediately:
- SUP | US | Demand Gen 60 17/11
- SUP | US | Demand Gen Retargeting 60 17/11

**Savings**: £153/day spend with ZERO conversions = £1,071/week pure waste

**Rationale**:
- Top-of-funnel awareness campaigns don't make sense when stock depleted
- No conversions in Dec 7-13 = complete waste
- Easy to restart in January when stock returns

---

### Option 3: REDUCE US BUDGETS BY 50% (Cautious Approach)

**Action**: Cut US budgets from £6,922/day → £3,500/day

**Target Campaigns**:
- Shopping Branded: £1,020 → £500/day
- P Max Brand Excluded: £1,574 → £800/day
- Search Brand: £1,192 → £600/day (maintain brand protection)
- Shopping Brand Excluded: £1,008 → £500/day
- Search Generics: £128 → £100/day
- Demand Gen: PAUSE (£153 → £0)

**Expected Impact**:
- Spend: £6,922 → £3,500/day (save £3,422/day)
- If ROAS stays ~450%, still make £2,000-3,000/day net profit
- Reduces waste while maintaining presence

**Rationale**:
- Limits downside if conversions are false positives
- Maintains campaign activity for January restart
- Still generates meaningful profit

---

### Option 4: BRAND ONLY (Most Conservative)

**Action**: Pause all Shopping/PMax, keep only Search Brand

**Active Campaigns**:
- Search Brand: £1,192/day (current spend)
- All others: PAUSED

**Expected Impact**:
- Spend: £6,922 → £1,200/day (save £5,722/day)
- Protects brand searches only
- Zero spend on generic product searches

**Rationale**:
- If stock truly depleted, no point in Shopping/PMax
- Brand searches need protection (competitors may bid)
- Easiest to restart in January (just unpause)

---

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Step 1 (Immediate)**: Pause Demand Gen campaigns
- £153/day waste with zero conversions
- No downside to pausing
- Save £1,071/week

**Step 2 (Within 24 Hours)**: Verify conversion source
- Check Shopify orders Dec 7-13
- Are they for January delivery?
  - **If YES**: Keep running (Option 1)
  - **If NO**: Reduce 50% (Option 3) or Brand Only (Option 4)

**Step 3 (When Stock Returns in January)**: 3-Phase Ramp
- Don't jump from current spend back to £12k/day
- Phase 1: Current → £9k/day (+30%)
- Phase 2: £9k → £11k/day (+22%)
- Phase 3: £11k → £12k/day (+9%)
- 48-72 hour gaps between phases

## ⚠️ **Key Assumptions & Caveats**

### Conversion Lag
- 85% conversions occur within 1 day
- 15% conversion lag = some Dec 7-13 conversions from earlier clicks
- ~107 conversions may be "legacy" from pre-stock-depletion
- ~607 conversions need explanation (January orders? UK/AU? Partial stock?)

### Gross Margin
- Using 43% from CONTEXT.md
- Assumes consistent margin across products
- If margin varies by product, actual profit may differ

### Multi-Market Data
- This analysis includes ALL markets (US/UK/AU combined)
- US-specific performance may be worse if UK/AU performing better
- **Need to separate markets to get accurate US-only view**

---

## 🔬 **Next Steps for Deeper Analysis**

**1. Check Shopify Order Data (Dec 7-13)**
- Filter orders by date: Dec 7-13
- Check delivery dates: Are they January?
- Check order notes: Any "sold out" related messages?

**2. Separate US vs UK/AU Performance**
- Query campaign-level data
- Calculate US-only ROAS
- If UK/AU performing well, may explain blended profitability

**3. Check Product-Level Stock Status**
- Are ALL products sold out or just some?
- Are there size/variant differences?
- Update Merchant Centre feed if needed

**4. Monitor Dec 14-20 Performance**
- Has ROAS continued to decline?
- Has conversion volume dropped further?
- Use this week's data to refine recommendation

---

## 💰 **Summary: What Craig Needs to Know**

**Current State**:
- Making £6,471/day net profit (£45,297 in last 7 days)
- ROAS 454% (above breakeven, below target)
- NOT losing money, just making less profit than ideal

**The Gap**:
- Making £4,466/day LESS profit than at 600% target ROAS
- Over 7 days: £31,264 less profit than ideal
- Over 30 days: £134,000 less profit than ideal

**The Trade-Off**:
- Keep running: Make £6,471/day but risk some waste
- Pause/reduce: Save potential waste but lose £6,471/day profit

**Critical Unknown**:
- Are conversions for January delivery orders?
- If YES: Keep running (legitimate orders)
- If NO: Reduce/pause (minimise waste)

**Immediate Action**:
- Pause Demand Gen campaigns (£153/day waste, zero conversions)
- Check Shopify orders to determine if January delivery
- Decide based on that data
