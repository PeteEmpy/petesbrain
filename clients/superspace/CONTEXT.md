## Strategic Context

### Current Strategy

- **Campaign Structure**: Multi-market approach with separate campaigns for US, UK, and Australia
- **Primary Campaign Type**: Performance Max (PMax) with Target ROAS bidding
- **Bidding Strategy**: Target ROAS 500-550% (adjusted seasonally). Q4 2025 plan: Progressive ROAS reduction from 550% to 380% to maximize volume during peak season
- **Key Focus Areas**:
  - Q4 Christmas season optimization (major revenue period)
  - Australia market expansion (launched Aug 2025)
  - Demand Gen campaign testing (launched Sept 2025)
  - Managing stock constraints and budget flexibility
- **Google Accelerator Programme**: Enrolled October 2025 - high-growth potential account with Google assigning additional resources

### Why This Approach?

- **Multi-Country Structure**: US is primary market (90% of sales), with UK and Australia as expansion markets. Separate campaigns allow for market-specific optimization and budget control
- **Target ROAS Strategy**: Product has strong margins (43% gross margin) allowing for aggressive ROAS targets while maintaining profitability. Target CPA goal: £50
- **Seasonal ROAS Adjustment**: Reducing ROAS targets during Q4 to maximize audience building and volume during peak shopping season, accepting lower short-term profitability for long-term customer acquisition
- **PMax Heavy**: Product is highly visual and benefits from cross-channel exposure (Shopping, Display, YouTube, Discovery). Giant magnetic tiles are unique and eye-catching
- **Demand Gen Testing**: Grandparents identified as primary buyers (gift purchases for grandchildren). Demand Gen targeting older demographics (60+) who respond well to video content
- **Stock-Responsive Budgeting**: Physical product with manufacturing lead times requires flexible budget management to avoid over-selling during stock constraints

### Goals & KPIs

**Primary Goal**: Revenue growth and customer acquisition during Q4 peak season
**Target ROAS**: 550% (current), planned reduction to 380-450% during Q4 peak (implementation pending - budget increases prioritized first)
**Target CPA**: £50 blended across all markets
**Other KPIs**:
- Conversion rate improvement (Nov 13: Core campaigns at 4.88-5.35% - excellent performance)
- Market expansion success in Australia
- Repeat purchase rate optimization (currently 18.5% - strong foundation)

### November 2025 US Budget History

**Phase 1 - Scaling (Nov 13):**
- Increased from ~£5,000/day to £12,010/day (+140%)
- Reason: Strong CR (4.88-5.35%) and Q4 peak opportunity

**Phase 2 - Stock Crisis Response (Nov 17-21):**
- Nov 17-18: ROAS increased 550% → 600% (first response)
- Nov 20: 20% ROAS-weighted reduction (£14,460 → £11,568)
- Nov 21: Additional 10% reduction (£11,568 → £10,397)
- Reason: US Christmas stock depleting faster than anticipated

**Current Budget Breakdown (Nov 21):**
- Shopping Branded: £3,229/day (was £3,669)
- P Max Brand Excluded: £2,809/day (was £3,121)
- Shopping Brand Excluded: £2,352/day (was £2,613)
- Search Brand Inclusion: £1,403/day (was £1,493)
- Search Generics: £604/day (was £657)
- Demand Gen main: PAUSED (was £300/day)
- Demand Gen Retargeting: PAUSED (was £150/day)

**Total Active US Budget:** £10,397/day (down 28% from peak £14,460)

**Next Steps:**
- Monday Nov 25: Phase 3 - Additional 10% if stock still depleting
- Early Dec: Ramp back up when new inventory arrives

**Target ROAS:** 600% (increased from 550% to slow spend)

## Historical Performance Patterns

### Seasonality

- **Peak Season**: Q4 (Nov-Dec) Christmas shopping - accounts for majority of annual revenue
- **Prime Day Impact**: Amazon Prime Day (typically Oct) helps trigger "shopping mode" and increases overall market demand
- **Timing Shift 2025**: Consumers starting Christmas shopping 2-3 weeks later than previous years (observed Sept-Oct 2025)
- **Stock Constraints**: Major challenge - Oct 2025 stock running low with less than 2 weeks inventory at current run-rate, new stock not expected until early Dec 2025
- **Slow Periods**: Post-holiday January-February expected to be slower

### Year-Over-Year Trends

- **2025 vs 2024**: Increased competitor aggression (Target entered market, Amazon reduced presence in Shopping ads)
- **CPA Volatility**: Week-by-week CPAs show high variance. September 2025 showed unusual spike around week 38, potentially related to conversion tracking issues with Shopify Google app
- **Australia Launch**: Aug 2025 - new market with separate Shopify store (getsuperspace.com.au), currently building momentum
- **Conversion Tracking Improvement**: August 2025 - implemented Shopify plugin conversion tracking, showing more conversions than previous setup

### Known Anomalies

- **September 2025 Tracking Issue**: Conversion tracking anomaly related to Google app within Shopify. Resolved but caused temporary CPA spike
- **Demand Gen Learning Phase**: Sept-Oct 2025 campaign showing volatile performance during 13-45 day learning period (normal for new Demand Gen campaigns)
- **Algorithm Protection Mode**: "superspace amazon" brand search has low impression share due to Google's algorithm learning from early 2024 success followed by poor performance - now being conservative to protect profitability

---

## Client Preferences & Communication

### Communication Style

- **Preferred Update Frequency**: Regular check-ins, responsive to email, proactive about strategy discussions
- **Preferred Format**: Email primary, video meetings for strategy (Google Meet)
- **Detail Level**: Client appreciates detailed analysis with visual charts/graphs. Craig and Ant both data-oriented and engaged
- **Response Pattern**: Based in London, UK (but operating from NZ time zone for Craig). Quick to respond during business hours

### Decision-Making

- **Who Makes Final Decisions**: Craig Spencer (Co-Founder) and Ant Erwin (Co-Founder) - collaborative decision making
- **Approval Process**: Generally quick to approve strategic changes, trust agency recommendations
- **Risk Tolerance**: Moderate to Aggressive - willing to test new approaches (Demand Gen, Australia expansion, ROAS reduction strategy)
- **Budget Flexibility**: Responsive to changing needs - able to quickly reduce budgets during stock shortages or increase for peak season

### Red Flags / Sensitive Topics

- **Stock Management**: Very sensitive to stock levels - must be informed immediately if campaigns driving too much volume when inventory is low
- **AI Discoverability**: October 2025 initiative to create llms.txt and agents.txt files. Technical implementation challenge with Shopify root directory access (Daniel struggling to upload files)
- **Counterfeit Products**: Serious concern - Temu/AliExpress copycat products appearing in search results. Discussed brand protection strategies
- **Brand Search Protection**: Concerned about competitors (especially Amazon comparison searches) but understand ROAS strategy prioritizes profitability over impression share

## Business Context

### Product/Service Details

**Top Performer**: Giant Magnetic Building Tiles (Life-Size)
- Large set tiles for fort-building and creative play
- Unique product positioning (life-size vs tabletop competitors like Magna-Tiles)
- High AOV: $400 USD average (US market)
- Strong visual appeal - performs well in video/image ads

**Primary Product SKUs**:
- Big Set (premium) - $20 shipping
- Rectangles - $15 shipping
- Squares - $12 shipping

**Problem Products**: None identified - focused product line is advantage

**Pricing Strategy**: Premium positioning ($400 AOV) - higher than standard magnetic tile competitors
**Average Order Value**: $400 USD (US), varies by market
**Typical Margins**: 43% gross margin
**Tax**: ~6% (US)
**Return Rate**: Very low (<1% actual returns). "Returns" in data primarily cancellations before dispatch

### Customer Insights (US Market Data - Oct 2025)

**Repeat Purchase Analysis**:
- 18.5% overall repeat purchase rate (strong retention foundation)
- 45,263 total customers with orders (12-month period)
- 8,376 repeat customers (2+ orders)
- 1,469 loyal customers (3+ orders) - 3.2% of total
- 34 super loyal customers (5+ orders) - 0.1% of total
- 81.5% single-purchase customers = significant opportunity for retention improvement

**Key Buyer Demographics**:
- **Grandparents are primary buyers** (discovered through Demand Gen campaign data)
- Purchasing as gifts for grandchildren (birthdays, Christmas)
- Older demographic (60+) responds well to video content
- Parents are influencers but grandparents are purchasers

**Repeat Buyer Progression**: Among repeat customers, 17.5% progress to 3+ orders, showing good loyalty once second purchase is made

**Strategic Opportunities**:
- Post-purchase engagement for first-time buyers
- Retention campaigns 30-90 days after first purchase
- Email segmentation by single vs. multi-purchase audiences (Daniel implementing)

### Website & Technical

**Website Platform**: Shopify (3 separate stores)
- US: superspace-com.myshopify.com (www.getsuperspace.com)
- UK: separate Shopify store
- Australia: getsuperspace.com.au (launched Aug 2025, transitioned from Shopify Markets /en-au)

**Known Technical Issues**:
- Conversion Tracking: August 2025 - switched to Shopify plugin for more accurate conversion tracking. Previous setup was under-reporting
- Google Plugin Issue: September 2025 - Shopify Google app missing basket data (not affecting main conversion data)
- AI Discoverability Files: October 2025 - difficulty uploading llms.txt/agents.txt to Shopify root directory
- Channable Feed: Set up for product data feeds across all three stores

**Conversion Tracking**:
- **Setup**: Shopify plugin (as of Aug 2025), Google Ads conversions
- **Known Issues**: 85% of conversions occur within 1 day of first click (15% attributed later)
- **Last Audit**: August 2025 (tracking improvement implemented)

**Google Merchant Center**: Set up by Peter for Australia site (Aug 2025)

### Competitive Landscape

**Main Competitors**:
- Magna-Tiles (tabletop magnetic tiles - different size category)
- Amazon (reduced Shopping ad presence in 2025, but still comparison search concern)
- Target (very aggressive - jumped into gap left by Amazon, major competitor in 2025)
- Temu/AliExpress (copycat/counterfeit products - major brand protection concern)

**Competitive Advantages**:
- Unique product positioning (life-size vs tabletop)
- High-quality construction
- Strong visual/experiential appeal
- Patent/IP protection (though counterfeiters are issue)

**Competitive Disadvantages**:
- Premium pricing vs cheaper alternatives
- Limited product line (single core product with variations)
- Counterfeit products appearing in search results damaging brand

---

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Issues

- **Stock Shortage (Oct-Dec 2025)**: Running low on inventory for both UK and Australia. Less than 2 weeks stock at current run-rate. New stock not expected until early December 2025. **Action**: Budget reduced by 50% on Oct 21, 2025 to ~£300 UK / ~£200 AU daily
- **Counterfeit Products**: Temu and AliExpress copycat products appearing in Google search results. Researching brand protection solutions
- **AI Discoverability Implementation**: Technical challenge uploading llms.txt/agents.txt files to Shopify root directory (Daniel working on solution Oct 2025)
- **Q4 Stock Timing**: Risk of running out of stock by Dec 10 if sales continue at current pace, potentially missing last-minute Christmas shopping peak

### Recurring Challenges

- **Stock/Inventory Management**: Physical product with long manufacturing lead times requires careful balance between maximizing sales and avoiding out-of-stock situations
- **Conversion Rate Dilution**: Video views in Demand Gen campaign count as "ad interactions" causing apparent conversion rate drops (but actual conversion rate is improving)
- **Seasonal CPA Volatility**: Week-to-week CPA fluctuations make short-term optimization challenging
- **Multi-Currency Management**: Operating in GBP, AUD, and USD requires currency-aware reporting and budget management

### External Factors to Monitor

- **Competitor Aggression**: Target entered market aggressively in 2025. Ongoing monitoring of competitive landscape
- **Shopping Timing Shifts**: Consumer behavior showing later start to holiday shopping in 2025 vs prior years
- **Stock/Supply Chain**: Manufacturing and shipping timelines critical for seasonal planning
- **Counterfeit/IP Enforcement**: Ongoing issue requiring potential legal/enforcement action

---

## Key Learnings & Insights

### What Works Well

- **Video Content for Demand Gen**: Product is highly visual and experiential. Video ads showing children playing with life-size tiles perform well, especially with 60+ demographic
- **Target ROAS Bidding**: Algorithm performs well with clear profitability targets. Flexible ROAS adjustment strategy allows for volume control
- **Grandparent Targeting**: Discovery that grandparents are primary buyers (not parents) fundamentally changed targeting strategy
- **Multi-Market Approach**: Separate campaigns for US/UK/Australia allows for market-specific optimization and budget flexibility
- **Brand Search Protective Bidding**: Algorithm's conservative approach to "superspace amazon" searches actually protects profitability by avoiding wasteful comparison searches

### What Doesn't Work

- **Portrait Video Only**: Need horizontal format videos for desktop traffic (desktop still significant). FB-focused portrait videos don't cover full placement needs
- **Aggressive Brand Defense**: Attempting to dominate "superspace amazon" brand searches would sacrifice profitability for visibility
- **Static Content for Demand Gen**: Product needs motion/experience to sell - static images underperform vs video

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Aug 2025 | Shopify Plugin Conversion Tracking | Success - capturing more conversions than previous setup | Implemented across all three stores |
| Sept 2025 | Demand Gen Campaign Launch (US) | Learning phase - early data shows 60+ demographic strong performers, CTR peaked at 3.43% | Continuing through 45-day learning period, plan to scale in Oct |
| Oct 2025 | Q4 ROAS Reduction Strategy | Planned - progressive reduction from 550% to 380% | Scheduled rollout mid-Nov through Dec |
| Oct 2025 | Paused Demand Gen Non-Lookalike Ad Groups | Lookalike audience performing best | Consolidated to best-performing audiences (Oct 23) |

### Failed Tests (Learn From)

| Date | Test Description | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Feb 2024 | Aggressive "superspace amazon" Brand Bidding | Early success followed by poor performance, algorithm now conservative | Brand comparison searches don't convert well. ROAS strategy correctly deprioritizes these |

## Campaign-Specific Notes

### Campaign: US Performance Max (Primary Revenue Driver)

- **Purpose**: Main revenue generation campaign for US market (90% of total business)
- **Structure**: Target ROAS 550%, total US budget £12,010/day (as of Nov 13, 2025)
- **Budget Breakdown**: Shopping campaigns £6,700/day, PMax £2,700/day, Search £1,990/day, Demand Gen £600/day
- **Performance Notes**: Consistently strong performer. CPA target £50. Core campaign conversion rate 4.88-5.35% (Nov 13, excellent performance)
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Q4 strategy: Budget increases prioritized first (Nov 13), ROAS reduction available as next lever if needed
  - Must monitor stock levels closely during peak season
  - Budget scaled 140% on Nov 13 for Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak window

### Campaign: UK Performance Max

- **Purpose**: UK market revenue generation
- **Structure**: Target ROAS 500-550%, ~£600 daily budget (reduced to ~£300 Oct 2025)
- **Performance Notes**: Strong market but currently constrained by stock shortage (Oct-Dec 2025)
- **Special Considerations**: Budget reduced 50% due to stock constraints. Will ramp back up when new inventory arrives early Dec

### Campaign: Australia Performance Max

- **Purpose**: New market expansion (launched Aug 2025)
- **Structure**: Target ROAS 500-550%, ~£400 daily budget (reduced to ~£200 Oct 2025)
- **Performance Notes**: Building momentum, separate Shopify store (getsuperspace.com.au). Merchant Center and Channable feed configured
- **Special Considerations**: Budget reduced 50% due to stock constraints. Still in growth phase - expect performance to improve as data accumulates

### Campaign: Demand Gen (US - Test Campaign)

- **Purpose**: Top-of-funnel awareness and customer acquisition, targeting grandparents (60+) as gift buyers for grandchildren
- **Structure**: Target ROAS bidding, video-heavy creative, £600/day total budget (Nov 13: £450 main + £150 retargeting)
- **Performance Notes**: Launched Sept 2025, paused briefly, restarted Nov 9. Generating 1,000-1,500 clicks/day (mostly video views and YouTube placements). CTR peaked at 3.43%, 60+ age group performs strongly. Lookalike audience outperforming
- **Conversion Rate Context (CRITICAL)**:
  - Demand Gen CR: 0-0.13% (normal for top-of-funnel awareness campaigns)
  - Core campaigns (PMax/Shopping/Search) CR: 4.88-5.35% (excellent performance)
  - Demand Gen dilutes overall account CR by 0.93-1.50 percentage points
  - **This is expected behavior** - Demand Gen builds awareness and feeds retargeting funnel
  - Always analyze CR separately: Bottom-funnel (core campaigns) vs Blended (all campaigns)
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Video views count as ad interactions (dilutes conversion rate metric - exclude when analyzing overall CR)
  - Need horizontal video formats for desktop placements
  - Targeting 60+ grandparent demographic specifically (primary buyers, not parents)
  - Scaled aggressively Nov 13 following strong core campaign performance

### Campaign: Search Brand (US/UK)

- **Purpose**: Brand protection and high-intent brand searches
- **Structure**: Target ROAS with flexible bidding
- **Performance Notes**: "superspace amazon" keyword shows low impression share by design (algorithm protecting profitability after learning from 2024 performance)
- **Special Considerations**: Could switch to impression share bidding for brand protection but would sacrifice profitability. Current approach is correct for business goals

### [Superspace] Review ROAS reduction decision (550% → 495%)
<!-- task_id: c25CM3ZGdnI2ZzRZenNrNw -->
**Status:** ✅ SUPERSEDED (2025-11-21)

---
**Follow-up from:** ROAS reduction deferred Nov 13
**Parent Task ID:** aEw0WkZKbTcxRndZZ1dZcQ

**SUPERSEDED - Strategy Reversed Due to Stock Crisis:**
This task is no longer applicable. The original plan to reduce ROAS (to increase volume) has been completely reversed due to US Christmas stock depleting faster than anticipated.

**New Strategy (Nov 17-21):**
- ROAS INCREASED from 550% → 600% (opposite of this task)
- Budget REDUCED by 28% (£14,460 → £10,397/day)
- Demand Gen campaigns PAUSED
- Goal changed from "maximize volume" to "preserve stock"

**Original Task Intent:** Reduce ROAS to capture more volume
**Actual Outcome:** ROAS increased and budgets cut to slow sales

See tasks-completed.md entries for Nov 20-21 budget reduction documentation.

**Follow-up from:** [Superspace] Scale US budgets (completed Nov 13)
**Parent Task ID:** aTJvQnVqS1ZhZ2NwTU93NQ

**SUPERSEDED - Budget Increases Reversed Due to Stock Crisis:**
This monitoring task is no longer applicable. The budget increases that were to be monitored have been reversed due to US Christmas stock depleting faster than anticipated.

**What Happened:**
- Nov 13: Budget increased to £12k/day (the increase this task was monitoring)
- Nov 17: Stock crisis identified - selling through too fast
- Nov 20: Phase 1 reduction - 20% ROAS-weighted cut
- Nov 21: Phase 2 reduction - additional 10% cut
- Current budget: £10,397/day (down 28% from peak)

**Performance Before Reversal (Nov 13-17):**
- ROAS: 892% blended (exceeded 550% target)
- Conversion rate: 3.85% (exceeded 3% target)
- CPA: £27 (well below £50 target)
- Result: Budget increase worked TOO WELL, depleting stock faster than planned

See tasks-completed.md for full documentation of Nov 20-21 budget reductions.

### [Superspace] P0: Pre-Black Friday Demand Gen Review - URGENT Budget Decision
<!-- task_id: YmlSYmZtN3F1R3F2c2o3VA -->
**Status:** ✅ SUPERSEDED (2025-11-21)

**SUPERSEDED - Demand Gen Campaigns PAUSED Due to Stock Crisis:**
This task is no longer applicable. Both Demand Gen campaigns were PAUSED on Nov 20 as part of the stock crisis response. There will be no Black Friday budget increase for Demand Gen.

**What Happened:**
- Nov 13: Demand Gen scaled to £600/day total (Main £450 + Retargeting £150)
- Nov 17: Stock crisis identified - US Christmas stock depleting too fast
- Nov 20: Both Demand Gen campaigns PAUSED to preserve stock
- Decision: Top-of-funnel awareness campaigns deprioritised in favour of preserving stock for existing demand

**Why Demand Gen Was Paused:**
- Campaigns only 3 days old when paused - insufficient data to evaluate
- £450/day budget better saved or deployed to proven campaigns
- Stock timeline requires immediate spend reduction
- Can re-enable when stock position stabilises (expected early Dec)

**Performance Before Pause (Nov 13-17):**
- Demand Gen Main: 262% ROAS (14-day)
- Demand Gen Retargeting: 502% ROAS (14-day)
- Combined: 252% blended ROAS
- Promising results but stock constraint takes priority

**Original Task Intent:** Decide whether to increase Demand Gen for Black Friday
**Actual Outcome:** Campaigns paused entirely - no Black Friday scaling

**Future Consideration:**
- Re-evaluate Demand Gen when new inventory arrives (early Dec)
- Retargeting campaign showed strong potential (502% ROAS) - priority for re-enabling
- Consider Q1 2025 restart once stock position stable


### [Superspace] P0: Regenerate orders timeline chart with Nov 24 full data
<!-- task_id: akdCY1J5clFMTHNQbU1QNg -->
**Status:** 📋 In Progress  

**PRIORITY:** P0 - Morning task for Nov 25

**STEP 1: Download Shopify Data (DO THIS FIRST)**
1. Go to Shopify Admin: superspace-com.myshopify.com
2. Navigate to: Analytics → Reports → Orders over time
3. Set date range: Oct 1, 2025 - Nov 25, 2025
4. Export as CSV
5. Save to Downloads folder (will auto-name: "Orders over time - 2025-10-01 - 2025-11-25.csv")

**STEP 2: Update and Run Script**
1. Update CSV path in script (line 13):
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('/Users/administrator/Downloads/Orders over time - 2025-10-01 - 2025-11-25.csv')
   ```
2. Run visualization:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain/clients/superspace/analysis
   python3 orders-timeline-visualization-v2.py
   ```

**STEP 3: Review Impact**
- Check if Phase 3 budget cut (Nov 24: -10% to £9.4k/day) shows any impact on orders
- Nov 24 currently shows only 325 orders (partial day) - full data will reveal true impact

**Context:** 
Chart shows orders timeline with all 6 Google Ads budget changes marked. Need complete Nov 24 data to assess if throttle is working.

**Budget timeline:**
- Nov 13: £12,010/day (peak)
- Nov 20: £11,568/day (-20%)
- Nov 21: £10,397/day (-10%)
- Nov 24: £9,357/day (-10%) ← Need full day's data

<!-- task_id: QkZEcXpjZlRwaVVieVp2dA -->
**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-11-17)

**Follow-up from:** [Superspace] Increase Demand Gen budgets (completed Nov 13)
**Parent Task ID:** a2I5bXFON0RUcjJUa1loaA
**Parent context:** Increased Demand Gen main to £450/day, retargeting to £150/day

**ANALYSIS COMPLETED (Nov 17, 2025):**

**Performance Nov 13-17 (4 full days):**
- Demand Gen Main: £1,865 spend, 6.8 conversions, £2,675 value = 143% ROAS
- Demand Gen Retargeting: £621 spend, 7.7 conversions, £2,267 value = 365% ROAS
- Combined: 252% blended ROAS

**Key Findings:**
✅ Both campaigns BUDGET CONSTRAINED (demand exists, could scale further)
✅ Retargeting performing excellently at 502% ROAS (14-day view)
✅ Learning phase volatility normal (0-591% daily ROAS swings expected)
✅ Nov 15 best day for Main campaign (4.2 conversions, £1,428 value)
⚠️ Main campaign showing typical learning volatility (262% ROAS 14-day view)

**Recommendations:**
1. Hold current budgets through Nov 24 (complete 14-day learning minimum)
2. Review 7-day aggregate ROAS Nov 13-20 before any adjustments
3. Expect continued volatility - don't react to single-day drops
4. Retargeting could sustain budget increases if needed (running 502% ROAS)

**Strategic Context:**
- Top-of-funnel awareness campaigns expected lower ROAS than core (550%+)
- Combined performance feeding retargeting funnel successfully
- Grandparent targeting (60+) showing promise in video placements

**Next review:** Nov 24 (14-day learning phase completion)
