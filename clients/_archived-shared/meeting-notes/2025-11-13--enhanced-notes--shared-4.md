- 'Them: Hi, peter.'
- 'Me: All right.'
- 'Them: How are you? You okay?'
- 'Me: Can you hear me? No.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I can hear you.'
- 'Me: It''s Monday morning.'
- 'Them: How you doing? You all right?'
- 'Me: Yeah, I''m good. Thank you very much. Yeah, not so bad at all.'
- 'Them: Brilliant. Thanks for hopping on a call.'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: Obviously I messaged you because I come across you LinkedIn profile.'
- 'Me: Wait.'
- 'Them: And we were looking for someone to do. Basically, we do marketing strategy
  and we do web design, web development in house. We have someone that does ppc, but
  they''re off poly at the moment. So we''re just kind of using freelancers and subcontractors,
  so just trying to talk to as many people that can potentially help us out.'
- 'Me: A busy day, then.'
- 'Them: We''ve spoken to loads of people. Spoken to loads of people. It''s quite
  important to me that they''re UK based.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I don''t want someone who''s in a different time zone. Obviously, that very
  often delays projects, that very often there''s multiple problems and also the language
  barrier.'
- 'Me: Yeah, absolutely.'
- 'Them: Can sometimes impact things. So, yeah, basically anyone that''s UK based
  that can sort of help us, we''re open to collaboration.'
- 'Me: Okay, yeah, that sounds good, mate. I mean, you''ve read LinkedIn, anyway.
  If you want me to give you a quick overview of what I''m doing at the moment,'
- 'Them: Yes, please.'
- 'Me: So I have 11 clients at the moment.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: SEM. So yes, I would say that wrong SMEs and no, I do SEM. I''ve been doing
  Google Ads for 25 years now. God. I started off with my own business. That''s how
  I applied my trade, then went client side and then I''ve been freelancing for 15
  years. Most of my clients are through referrals. I don''t actively go out and get
  clients, which, you know, you would if you look back over 15 years. I''ve not exactly
  been living life on the edge either. I''ve not struggled to find people.'
- 'Them: That speaks volumes.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you want recommendations to people, if you ever want
  to speak to any of my clients, then you''re more than welcome to. I think the one
  thing I say to my clients is that the. The edge that I give them is the fact I''ve
  done this myself. I''ve been spending my own money in the past. And now the thing
  that keeps me up at night is I''m still spending my own money. So. But that''s multiplied
  by however many clients have got. So it gives it a bit of a. It gives it a bit of
  an edge. You know, the. I view this. I don''t view this from, oh, isn''t this a
  pretty little campaign structure? And it''s doing this new thing. And that new thing.
  What I do is I adopt the new technologies.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: To reach a goal, which is to make money for the clients. Because.'
- 'Them: That''s what pays for us, isn''t it? That''s what pays for me and you.'
- 'Me: Very much so, yeah.'
- 'Them: That''s what the client cares about.'
- 'Me: It is. And I''m speaking to the business owner typically. So I do know that,
  you know, I do have to justify my existence, really, you know, because I''m looking
  at. I''m looking at profit for the, for the month and say, well, take my bit out
  of that, and then what''s left for the client. Are they going to be happy with that?
  The latest thing is it''s been quite weird over the last couple of weeks. I''ve.
  I put all my Google rep meetings pretty much on hold.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Number one, because the boring is sin. They''re not telling me anything new
  at all. And the other one, I''ve been developed. I''ve just been getting heavily
  into AI really, really heavily into it. So I''ve developed, now developed a system
  which is all about collating all together, all the information I know. About my
  clients. Collating together all the information I know about Google Ads, about experiments,
  new tests I can do. I''m just trying to work smart with it. It''s kind of blowing
  my brain a little bit because it is, and I call it Pete''s Brain, it is literally
  dumping everything I know into one central repository. So. I''ve built that structure
  up. It makes it so that in the future, things like this one, I''m onboarding someone.
  I can just say, well, tell me what you know about the client. You know, have you
  got any documentation on the client, anything at all that will help me understand
  them and get this up and. Running as quickly as possible. They do an audit and actually
  look back. Not just the structure, because, I mean, the structured speech volumes
  anyway, but little back over the change log, see what''s happened recently, see
  what we need to be keeping an eye on. And it''s that kind of stuff, that level of
  granularity we''ve always wanted. To do, haven''t we? And we''ve never had the time
  to do it. We know what the best practices. But do you really know things like what
  impact did it have a product going out of stock?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: What''s the real impact of that? The impact of a price change on a product.
  Keeping track of disapprovals and things like that, they''re so difficult to do,
  but with some sort of AI system, I can have it popped up in front of me, say, look,
  this has happened and I can use my best skill. And judgment to actually say, well,
  actually, we need to do that now. And away we go.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, taking the analysis out of it. So it''s sweet. It''s really sweet.'
- 'Them: It''s really good. Yeah, we use AI quite a lot.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So we have a client. They do safety barriers.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: We''ve been doing a pay lad for them.'
- 'Me: I have excited the safety barriers.'
- 'Them: Okay. What''s the company called, if you don''t mind me asking?'
- 'Me: Ace called crowd control.'
- 'Them: Okay. How''s this called? West Yorkshire safety barriers.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: We''ve been working with him for over a year as an agency. He came to us.
  With a website that needed urgent assistance. It was done by someone who was a teacher.
  Become marketing guy, and he didn''t really know what he was doing. With all due
  respect to him. Put something together. And I said to him, we need to improve the
  website. We did a bit of SEO work for him and a bit of work on Google, and he got
  a few sales. But I said to him, look, it could be so much better if we improved
  the website. So we improved the website for him. Built a new website, and then we
  started doing SEO on that. But we also did some Google Ads.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So we did some Google Ads, and what we know, something just wasn''t hitting
  the spot. We were getting a lot of visitors to the website. The numbers looked good,
  but then there was, like, literally no conversions.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: There''s something wrong here. Went on and asked ChatGPT and it gave us some
  solutions and we sort of did it as a tick box. Thing. And I think we run another
  campaign since following that, we tweaked it a little bit, tweaked the website a
  little bit.'
- 'Me: Nice.'
- 'Them: The campaign''s running better now. So it''s really helpful identifying potential
  problems and thinking outside the box.'
- 'Me: Very much so, yeah.'
- 'Them: So we use it. We use it quite a lot.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: So do you just do Google Ads, then?'
- 'Me: I do do Facebook ads. So I know how to do Facebook ads. I''ve run it for a
  very large client before. Do I like it? It would be easier now. With a bit of AI.
  I think the problem with Facebook. Were you referring to Facebook ads?'
- 'Them: So I was just saying. What do you do? Do you do Google Ads?'
- 'Me: Facebook ads. Yes, I can do. It''s about content with Facebook ads. And I think
  that''s better driven from client side rather than me coming up with some ideas.
  It would be easier now to just generate auto generate it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I do do Microsoft ads as well. I''ve done Amazon ads in the past. I absolutely
  hate it. I really don''t want to do it again. Amazon''s sucking the life blood out
  of everybody, so I''d rather stay clear of it. I''ve got one client I''m doing Amazons
  for at the moment and. You''re just working for Amazon. Really?'
- 'Them: I think we have a lot of clients that sell on Amazon.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: For example, we''ve got a workwear client, and I think 50% of his revenue
  comes from selling on Amazon. And it''s not a case of you can''t beat it, you can''t.
  So you''ve got to be on there. But we''re trying to find ways to pull them from
  Amazon and directly order with them. But then they have all these rules, don''t
  they, that you can''t put. Branded stuff in there because obviously they''re not
  ordered through Amazon. So we''re trying to find ways around it that kind of don''t
  break the rules.'
- 'Me: Own the client. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: Of Amazon. You can''t beat them, but I always try and get them away and advertise
  on Google. Especially if it''s a product like Google shopping ads and things like
  that, to try and pull them away from Amazon a little bit.'
- 'Me: I think the. I mean, it was a lovely. When Amazon dropped off for a month,
  that was just sweet. It really was. I mean, they still offer. I think they''re still
  off in the US but it was just nice when they did it. And it''s all well and good.
  The client''s saying we do 50% of our revenue on Amazon. They say, well, what percentage
  of your profit is on Amazon?'
- 'Them: Yeah, very little.'
- 'Me: No. And we need to look about fba costs. Well, just FBA cost on their own are
  an absolute fortune. But you''ve got to be doing FBA to do prime.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then Amazon are the ultimate of pay to play. If you suddenly start doing
  paid ads. Well, all of a sudden, my organic results are doing really well. I use
  Amazon a hell of a lot because it''s just so easy. I''m not going to tell that to
  only a few people, but. If you do a search on Amazon now, it''s not relevant what
  you get back. Is it? It''s all just the ads at the top. It''s not relevant in the
  slightest.'
- 'Them: No, I''ve noticed that they do a lot of paid a lot more paid ads and they
  push the paid ads more and get it some revenue stream. And being in marketing, I
  completely understand why they''re doing it.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Clutters, aren''t they?'
- 'Them: A lot of the stuff we do is Google Ads for clients. Facebook ads is something
  that we offer, but it''s not something we get. Very often. The reason I was searching
  specifically for Facebook ads, which is what led me to your profile, was basically
  a networking friend of mine. They offer, like, AI software for ads and things like
  that.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But basically they''re wanting to run a Facebook ad. And I''ve basically
  said, yeah, we can probably help, but what they want is basically us to just set
  it up. And then just leave it. They don''t want to pay, like, a massive retainer.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So they''ve got a budget of, I think I said, about 20 pound per day. And
  they want the ad so that it goes to their messenger, so that their AI software can
  automatically respond. So I just wanted to get. To get your thoughts on that and
  to see if that is something that you''d be able. To help with because it''s not
  something I personally am an expert in. And at the moment, we don''t have the capacity
  to do it in house, but I''ve kind of already half said, yeah.'
- 'Me: I mean, and it''s kind of. That kind of is a really difficult question to answer
  because the actual answer to it is, no, I wouldn''t touch it with the barge pole.
  But at the end of the day, you know, if it smooths the flow of the. Of the. Of a.
  A relationship between us, then. I would look at it. For definite, you know, I can
  help to set it up. So long as there''s no responsibility for the results that come
  back from it, then that''s fine. You know, if it''s mechanics, then, and they. And
  they can be forthcoming with, you know, who they''re actually targeting, then fine.
  I don''t. Mind doing that. But if you. If you were a customer that came to me, I''d
  say absolutely no chance.'
- 'Them: I''ve said that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if I forward. If I forward you her email.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Can you share your thoughts with me on it? Because like I say, I''m strategy,
  I''m marketing strategy, and a little bit of SEO. I don''t really do. My knowledge
  is not with ads. No, the very basics. And there''s a few clients that I work with,
  and I think I know them well enough to do okay.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But she''s pretty narrowed down in terms of who she wants to work, you know,
  who she wants to target, their interest, demographics, things like that. So that
  side is. Is a positive. But I was a bit like you. I said yes to her because she
  was a networking friend. And then when she sent me the details, I. Was like, oh,
  shit, how am I going to say no to her? But it''d be interesting to get your thoughts.'
- 'Me: It was the 20 quid a day thing that''s really got me. You know, if you think.
  If you think of something like, so you''re doing Facebook, AI.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And you want to target people who are doing Facebook. There''s sort of competition
  you''ve got for that. It''s going to be immense.'
- 'Them: It''s quite high. Yeah.'
- 'Me: The first thought is as Dave, you if you''re on a retainer, you''d be on a
  Harding to nothing. She''s one of the reasons I say no, because I can''t make that
  win.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The first thoughts on it are, you know, you''re up against some big boys for
  that. They''re probably better off building a Facebook.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: A group of Facebook followers up, but also looking at LinkedIn, you know, actually
  targeting people on LinkedIn rather than talking to people on Facebook.'
- 'Them: Great. I. I actually suggested LinkedIn. Or LinkedIn or Google is what I
  said. You know, Google could be. Google could be a good platform, but they are,
  for some reason adamant that they want to do Facebook.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I''m just going to get her email up. Watch what she said. But that''s how
  forward it to you. But it''d be interesting your thoughts on it.'
- 'Me: Well. I bet. Yeah, no problem. No problem at all.'
- 'Them: Just out of curiosity for projects. For example, this one. Would you be sort
  of flexible to being white label, if you like? So.'
- 'Me: I''d rather be white label.'
- 'Them: Right. Okay, perfect. That. That''s good. Because we do. We like with the
  existing person that we use. Who''s called Mark, we would say, right, Mark''s going
  to be running this ad for you. To the client. We''d say, right, Mark''s going to
  be running this ad for you. He''s got access to an email address which is just PPC
  at Big One Marketing. And then we kind of say, right, you know, here''s his email.
  This is how to communicate with him. We can kind of monitor it. But he''s got access
  to it. And then we say, right, it''s Mark from Big One Marketing. So he basically
  is white label.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, I don''t have a problem with that. I suppose it''s the difficult
  bit. It''s the Google Ads bit, because I''ve got everything in my mcc. If it was
  a big one, marketing mcc, that''d be great.'
- 'Them: Yeah. We have a big one. Marketing.'
- 'Me: Great. Well, that will probably be the best way to go with it then, is to do
  is to do it like that. Then at least I can just flick between MCCs. Yeah, it''s
  nice to own the client, but in this sort of situation, it also distances me a little
  bit from the client as well, so that they''re not absolutely bombarding me, between
  you and me and SME is. Yeah, they are. I have a guy who. I''ve only just taken it
  on. It''s doing brilliant. It''s kids toys, so it''s doing brilliantly. And I email
  him regularly with an update on where it''s. Going and he''s still. Ring me. He
  says I need to. I need to ring you every week. Well, why? I''ve told you all the
  details. He said, well, you just need to know how it''s going and you''re just going.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve told you how it''s going, and then he rings you up and just tells you
  the same stories over and over again about how difficult it is in the business and
  just.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I could have done so much on your account and just do this call. I''m moaning,
  but you know what it''s like, don''t you?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Safety Barrier client that I mentioned. He voice notes me quite a lot
  on WhatsApp. So every day I''ll get a voice note. Every day. I know his wife''s
  name, I know his kid''s name.'
- 'Me: Oh, how lovely.'
- 'Them: And I kind of like it to a certain extent because we''ve worked with clients
  in the past where they don''t care. So we''ll be sent to them. You know, we need
  this information. We need that information, especially with the social media strategy
  side of things.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: We''ll say, you know, we need this form of content. We need information about
  this. And it''s like they don''t. Some people don''t care, but then you get others
  who care a little bit too much and bombard you too much. So obviously, as an agency,
  we will take that heat off yourself and things like that. How do you sort of cost
  things? Do you do it per project? Or do you do it based off of.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Cool.'
- 'Them: Hour.'
- 'Me: I used to do hours and I don''t anymore. I do it based upon what value I think
  I can bring to the business, which is a little bit. I know it sounds a bit woolly,
  but it has to be that way because you are looking at it and go, can I make a difference
  here or not? I mean, nine times out of 10, the answer is yes. And it always takes
  the heat off me a little bit when I''m talking to the client doing the doom presales
  to say, I''ll look at your account. I have no idea what I can do. I don''t know
  what I can help. You or not, and typically speaking, the answer is yes. But at least
  they feel as though you. Well, I have looked at it. I have audited it. And I don''t
  want to set myself up for failure in the future to look at it and go, I can''t do
  anything. I''m just going to be fighting this guy off for three months and then.
  It''s all going to go to it on a per client basis.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- "Me: I've set a limit now. I've set a bottom limit now of 750 per month. I don't\
  \ go any lower than that. And again, between you and me, I will try and go as high\
  \ above that as possible. If it's a client that's spending 20 grand a day, then\
  \ I'm not going to do it for \xA3750amonth. But in this kind of relationship, I\
  \ also appreciate the fact we've both got to try and make some money out of it.\
  \ So I am flexible, but not the 750."
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.'
- 'Me: And I don''t know where I sit in that. I have a friend who I actually taught
  paid search during the first place. He was a client. Now he does it himself for
  a number of clients, and he doesn''t start below 1000. He says to me, bloody hell.
  But what you don''t want to. Do is overcharge it, and then the expectation is a
  lot higher, isn''t it, with the client?'
- 'Them: That makes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I think it depends on the client. I mean, when
  we. When we price things, we consider their daily budget. Obviously, like you said,
  they''re spending 20 grand. You know, they''ve got some money.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: We. We class on their conversion value. So, you know, if they''re selling
  something like mugs, that''s really cheap.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: We can''t charge that much because otherwise they''re gonna have to sell
  700 mugs just to pay us. We obviously consider things like if we''ve been working
  with a client, we can gather, they''ll probably get a ring us that amount of time,
  take that time, that''s the cost.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: But we''re a similar price. Really? We start from 750 to 1,000. We''re not
  that registered yet. Are you back? Registered. So would that be 750 plus that?'
- 'Me: Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes.'
- 'Them: Yeah, because we''re not. Because.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: As an agency. We''re only a few years old and we''ve got two companies. Because
  I wanted to avoid being tax registered just because of all the headache, but obviously
  appreciate that.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Not everybody. Some people are. And we''re not that far away, so we''ll have
  to be soon. Unfortunately, I want to earn a little bit less. Actually, I don''t
  really want to mess around with vat.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It''s not too bad. And when we do it all through QuickBooks,
  you know, it''s. It''s.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I use x0.'
- 'Me: Yeah, and it''s one invoice a month, you know? You. I presume you got payroll
  and stuff, though, to do?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So it makes it a bit more complicated. But they''re selling. They''re so straightforward,
  these. These systems now, aren''t they, once you get it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, xm is quite good.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Xd was quite good. And we got a good deal with our accountant. We did their
  website and our accounts.'
- 'Me: Nice. I''ll save you, bobby.'
- 'Them: I didn''t have to fork out money. She didn''t have to fork out money, so
  it worked well.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Good.'
- 'Them: It was lovely to chat to you.'
- 'Me: I knew, mate.'
- 'Them: Like I said, I''ll forward you on this email from the client that I discussed.
  It''d be interesting to get your thoughts. If it''s really something you don''t
  want to do, then obviously feel free to tell me to bug her off. But it''d be interesting
  to get your thoughts and any sort of projects that come in PPC related. It''d be
  great to keep in touch.'
- 'Me: Okay? Yeah. Fantastic. No problem.'
- 'Them: And share them, and then if there''s sort of that opportunity, it''d be good
  to collaborate.'
- 'Me: At all. Did you? I don''t know whether you''ve got my email address. Yeah,
  she did. Yeah. You did? Yeah, of course I did a meeting thing with you.'
- 'Them: Think it''ll be on this joint? Is it? Peter e at rosys co uk.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Perfect. Yes, I''ll send the email to that when we get off the call. Even
  if it''s not that one, I''m sure there''ll be future chances to collaborate.'
- 'Me: Fantastic. Awesome. Yeah, look forward to it, mate.'
- 'Them: Yeah, Brilliant. Thanks a lot for your time, Peter.'

- Them: Hi, peter.
- Me: All right.
- Them: How are you? You okay?
- Me: Can you hear me? No.
- Them: Yeah, I can hear you.
- Me: It's Monday morning.
- Them: How you doing? You all right?
- Me: Yeah, I'm good. Thank you very much. Yeah, not so bad at all.
- Them: Brilliant. Thanks for hopping on a call.
- Me: No.
- Them: Obviously I messaged you because I come across you LinkedIn profile.
- Me: Wait.
- Them: And we were looking for someone to do. Basically, we do marketing strategy and we do web design, web development in house. We have someone that does ppc, but they're off poly at the moment. So we're just kind of using freelancers and subcontractors, so just trying to talk to as many people that can potentially help us out.
- Me: A busy day, then.
- Them: We've spoken to loads of people. Spoken to loads of people. It's quite important to me that they're UK based.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I don't want someone who's in a different time zone. Obviously, that very often delays projects, that very often there's multiple problems and also the language barrier.
- Me: Yeah, absolutely.
- Them: Can sometimes impact things. So, yeah, basically anyone that's UK based that can sort of help us, we're open to collaboration.
- Me: Okay, yeah, that sounds good, mate. I mean, you've read LinkedIn, anyway. If you want me to give you a quick overview of what I'm doing at the moment,
- Them: Yes, please.
- Me: So I have 11 clients at the moment.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: SEM. So yes, I would say that wrong SMEs and no, I do SEM. I've been doing Google Ads for 25 years now. God. I started off with my own business. That's how I applied my trade, then went client side and then I've been freelancing for 15 years. Most of my clients are through referrals. I don't actively go out and get clients, which, you know, you would if you look back over 15 years. I've not exactly been living life on the edge either. I've not struggled to find people.
- Them: That speaks volumes.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you want recommendations to people, if you ever want to speak to any of my clients, then you're more than welcome to. I think the one thing I say to my clients is that the. The edge that I give them is the fact I've done this myself. I've been spending my own money in the past. And now the thing that keeps me up at night is I'm still spending my own money. So. But that's multiplied by however many clients have got. So it gives it a bit of a. It gives it a bit of an edge. You know, the. I view this. I don't view this from, oh, isn't this a pretty little campaign structure? And it's doing this new thing. And that new thing. What I do is I adopt the new technologies.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: To reach a goal, which is to make money for the clients. Because.
- Them: That's what pays for us, isn't it? That's what pays for me and you.
- Me: Very much so, yeah.
- Them: That's what the client cares about.
- Me: It is. And I'm speaking to the business owner typically. So I do know that, you know, I do have to justify my existence, really, you know, because I'm looking at. I'm looking at profit for the, for the month and say, well, take my bit out of that, and then what's left for the client. Are they going to be happy with that? The latest thing is it's been quite weird over the last couple of weeks. I've. I put all my Google rep meetings pretty much on hold.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Number one, because the boring is sin. They're not telling me anything new at all. And the other one, I've been developed. I've just been getting heavily into AI really, really heavily into it. So I've developed, now developed a system which is all about collating all together, all the information I know. About my clients. Collating together all the information I know about Google Ads, about experiments, new tests I can do. I'm just trying to work smart with it. It's kind of blowing my brain a little bit because it is, and I call it Pete's Brain, it is literally dumping everything I know into one central repository. So. I've built that structure up. It makes it so that in the future, things like this one, I'm onboarding someone. I can just say, well, tell me what you know about the client. You know, have you got any documentation on the client, anything at all that will help me understand them and get this up and. Running as quickly as possible. They do an audit and actually look back. Not just the structure, because, I mean, the structured speech volumes anyway, but little back over the change log, see what's happened recently, see what we need to be keeping an eye on. And it's that kind of stuff, that level of granularity we've always wanted. To do, haven't we? And we've never had the time to do it. We know what the best practices. But do you really know things like what impact did it have a product going out of stock?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: What's the real impact of that? The impact of a price change on a product. Keeping track of disapprovals and things like that, they're so difficult to do, but with some sort of AI system, I can have it popped up in front of me, say, look, this has happened and I can use my best skill. And judgment to actually say, well, actually, we need to do that now. And away we go.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: You know, taking the analysis out of it. So it's sweet. It's really sweet.
- Them: It's really good. Yeah, we use AI quite a lot.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So we have a client. They do safety barriers.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: We've been doing a pay lad for them.
- Me: I have excited the safety barriers.
- Them: Okay. What's the company called, if you don't mind me asking?
- Me: Ace called crowd control.
- Them: Okay. How's this called? West Yorkshire safety barriers.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: We've been working with him for over a year as an agency. He came to us. With a website that needed urgent assistance. It was done by someone who was a teacher. Become marketing guy, and he didn't really know what he was doing. With all due respect to him. Put something together. And I said to him, we need to improve the website. We did a bit of SEO work for him and a bit of work on Google, and he got a few sales. But I said to him, look, it could be so much better if we improved the website. So we improved the website for him. Built a new website, and then we started doing SEO on that. But we also did some Google Ads.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So we did some Google Ads, and what we know, something just wasn't hitting the spot. We were getting a lot of visitors to the website. The numbers looked good, but then there was, like, literally no conversions.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: There's something wrong here. Went on and asked ChatGPT and it gave us some solutions and we sort of did it as a tick box. Thing. And I think we run another campaign since following that, we tweaked it a little bit, tweaked the website a little bit.
- Me: Nice.
- Them: The campaign's running better now. So it's really helpful identifying potential problems and thinking outside the box.
- Me: Very much so, yeah.
- Them: So we use it. We use it quite a lot.
- Me: Yeah, yeah.
- Them: So do you just do Google Ads, then?
- Me: I do do Facebook ads. So I know how to do Facebook ads. I've run it for a very large client before. Do I like it? It would be easier now. With a bit of AI. I think the problem with Facebook. Were you referring to Facebook ads?
- Them: So I was just saying. What do you do? Do you do Google Ads?
- Me: Facebook ads. Yes, I can do. It's about content with Facebook ads. And I think that's better driven from client side rather than me coming up with some ideas. It would be easier now to just generate auto generate it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I do do Microsoft ads as well. I've done Amazon ads in the past. I absolutely hate it. I really don't want to do it again. Amazon's sucking the life blood out of everybody, so I'd rather stay clear of it. I've got one client I'm doing Amazons for at the moment and. You're just working for Amazon. Really?
- Them: I think we have a lot of clients that sell on Amazon.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: For example, we've got a workwear client, and I think 50% of his revenue comes from selling on Amazon. And it's not a case of you can't beat it, you can't. So you've got to be on there. But we're trying to find ways to pull them from Amazon and directly order with them. But then they have all these rules, don't they, that you can't put. Branded stuff in there because obviously they're not ordered through Amazon. So we're trying to find ways around it that kind of don't break the rules.
- Me: Own the client. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Them: Of Amazon. You can't beat them, but I always try and get them away and advertise on Google. Especially if it's a product like Google shopping ads and things like that, to try and pull them away from Amazon a little bit.
- Me: I think the. I mean, it was a lovely. When Amazon dropped off for a month, that was just sweet. It really was. I mean, they still offer. I think they're still off in the US but it was just nice when they did it. And it's all well and good. The client's saying we do 50% of our revenue on Amazon. They say, well, what percentage of your profit is on Amazon?
- Them: Yeah, very little.
- Me: No. And we need to look about fba costs. Well, just FBA cost on their own are an absolute fortune. But you've got to be doing FBA to do prime.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And then Amazon are the ultimate of pay to play. If you suddenly start doing paid ads. Well, all of a sudden, my organic results are doing really well. I use Amazon a hell of a lot because it's just so easy. I'm not going to tell that to only a few people, but. If you do a search on Amazon now, it's not relevant what you get back. Is it? It's all just the ads at the top. It's not relevant in the slightest.
- Them: No, I've noticed that they do a lot of paid a lot more paid ads and they push the paid ads more and get it some revenue stream. And being in marketing, I completely understand why they're doing it.
- Me: Yeah. Clutters, aren't they?
- Them: A lot of the stuff we do is Google Ads for clients. Facebook ads is something that we offer, but it's not something we get. Very often. The reason I was searching specifically for Facebook ads, which is what led me to your profile, was basically a networking friend of mine. They offer, like, AI software for ads and things like that.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But basically they're wanting to run a Facebook ad. And I've basically said, yeah, we can probably help, but what they want is basically us to just set it up. And then just leave it. They don't want to pay, like, a massive retainer.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So they've got a budget of, I think I said, about 20 pound per day. And they want the ad so that it goes to their messenger, so that their AI software can automatically respond. So I just wanted to get. To get your thoughts on that and to see if that is something that you'd be able. To help with because it's not something I personally am an expert in. And at the moment, we don't have the capacity to do it in house, but I've kind of already half said, yeah.
- Me: I mean, and it's kind of. That kind of is a really difficult question to answer because the actual answer to it is, no, I wouldn't touch it with the barge pole. But at the end of the day, you know, if it smooths the flow of the. Of the. Of a. A relationship between us, then. I would look at it. For definite, you know, I can help to set it up. So long as there's no responsibility for the results that come back from it, then that's fine. You know, if it's mechanics, then, and they. And they can be forthcoming with, you know, who they're actually targeting, then fine. I don't. Mind doing that. But if you. If you were a customer that came to me, I'd say absolutely no chance.
- Them: I've said that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if I forward. If I forward you her email.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Can you share your thoughts with me on it? Because like I say, I'm strategy, I'm marketing strategy, and a little bit of SEO. I don't really do. My knowledge is not with ads. No, the very basics. And there's a few clients that I work with, and I think I know them well enough to do okay.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But she's pretty narrowed down in terms of who she wants to work, you know, who she wants to target, their interest, demographics, things like that. So that side is. Is a positive. But I was a bit like you. I said yes to her because she was a networking friend. And then when she sent me the details, I. Was like, oh, shit, how am I going to say no to her? But it'd be interesting to get your thoughts.
- Me: It was the 20 quid a day thing that's really got me. You know, if you think. If you think of something like, so you're doing Facebook, AI.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And you want to target people who are doing Facebook. There's sort of competition you've got for that. It's going to be immense.
- Them: It's quite high. Yeah.
- Me: The first thought is as Dave, you if you're on a retainer, you'd be on a Harding to nothing. She's one of the reasons I say no, because I can't make that win.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The first thoughts on it are, you know, you're up against some big boys for that. They're probably better off building a Facebook.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: A group of Facebook followers up, but also looking at LinkedIn, you know, actually targeting people on LinkedIn rather than talking to people on Facebook.
- Them: Great. I. I actually suggested LinkedIn. Or LinkedIn or Google is what I said. You know, Google could be. Google could be a good platform, but they are, for some reason adamant that they want to do Facebook.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I'm just going to get her email up. Watch what she said. But that's how forward it to you. But it'd be interesting your thoughts on it.
- Me: Well. I bet. Yeah, no problem. No problem at all.
- Them: Just out of curiosity for projects. For example, this one. Would you be sort of flexible to being white label, if you like? So.
- Me: I'd rather be white label.
- Them: Right. Okay, perfect. That. That's good. Because we do. We like with the existing person that we use. Who's called Mark, we would say, right, Mark's going to be running this ad for you. To the client. We'd say, right, Mark's going to be running this ad for you. He's got access to an email address which is just PPC at Big One Marketing. And then we kind of say, right, you know, here's his email. This is how to communicate with him. We can kind of monitor it. But he's got access to it. And then we say, right, it's Mark from Big One Marketing. So he basically is white label.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, I don't have a problem with that. I suppose it's the difficult bit. It's the Google Ads bit, because I've got everything in my mcc. If it was a big one, marketing mcc, that'd be great.
- Them: Yeah. We have a big one. Marketing.
- Me: Great. Well, that will probably be the best way to go with it then, is to do is to do it like that. Then at least I can just flick between MCCs. Yeah, it's nice to own the client, but in this sort of situation, it also distances me a little bit from the client as well, so that they're not absolutely bombarding me, between you and me and SME is. Yeah, they are. I have a guy who. I've only just taken it on. It's doing brilliant. It's kids toys, so it's doing brilliantly. And I email him regularly with an update on where it's. Going and he's still. Ring me. He says I need to. I need to ring you every week. Well, why? I've told you all the details. He said, well, you just need to know how it's going and you're just going.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: I've told you how it's going, and then he rings you up and just tells you the same stories over and over again about how difficult it is in the business and just.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I could have done so much on your account and just do this call. I'm moaning, but you know what it's like, don't you?
- Them: Yeah. Safety Barrier client that I mentioned. He voice notes me quite a lot on WhatsApp. So every day I'll get a voice note. Every day. I know his wife's name, I know his kid's name.
- Me: Oh, how lovely.
- Them: And I kind of like it to a certain extent because we've worked with clients in the past where they don't care. So we'll be sent to them. You know, we need this information. We need that information, especially with the social media strategy side of things.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: We'll say, you know, we need this form of content. We need information about this. And it's like they don't. Some people don't care, but then you get others who care a little bit too much and bombard you too much. So obviously, as an agency, we will take that heat off yourself and things like that. How do you sort of cost things? Do you do it per project? Or do you do it based off of.
- Me: Yeah. Cool.
- Them: Hour.
- Me: I used to do hours and I don't anymore. I do it based upon what value I think I can bring to the business, which is a little bit. I know it sounds a bit woolly, but it has to be that way because you are looking at it and go, can I make a difference here or not? I mean, nine times out of 10, the answer is yes. And it always takes the heat off me a little bit when I'm talking to the client doing the doom presales to say, I'll look at your account. I have no idea what I can do. I don't know what I can help. You or not, and typically speaking, the answer is yes. But at least they feel as though you. Well, I have looked at it. I have audited it. And I don't want to set myself up for failure in the future to look at it and go, I can't do anything. I'm just going to be fighting this guy off for three months and then. It's all going to go to it on a per client basis.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: I've set a limit now. I've set a bottom limit now of 750 per month. I don't go any lower than that. And again, between you and me, I will try and go as high above that as possible. If it's a client that's spending 20 grand a day, then I'm not going to do it for £750amonth. But in this kind of relationship, I also appreciate the fact we've both got to try and make some money out of it. So I am flexible, but not the 750.
- Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Me: And I don't know where I sit in that. I have a friend who I actually taught paid search during the first place. He was a client. Now he does it himself for a number of clients, and he doesn't start below 1000. He says to me, bloody hell. But what you don't want to. Do is overcharge it, and then the expectation is a lot higher, isn't it, with the client?
- Them: That makes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I think it depends on the client. I mean, when we. When we price things, we consider their daily budget. Obviously, like you said, they're spending 20 grand. You know, they've got some money.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: We. We class on their conversion value. So, you know, if they're selling something like mugs, that's really cheap.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: We can't charge that much because otherwise they're gonna have to sell 700 mugs just to pay us. We obviously consider things like if we've been working with a client, we can gather, they'll probably get a ring us that amount of time, take that time, that's the cost.
- Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: But we're a similar price. Really? We start from 750 to 1,000. We're not that registered yet. Are you back? Registered. So would that be 750 plus that?
- Me: Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes.
- Them: Yeah, because we're not. Because.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: As an agency. We're only a few years old and we've got two companies. Because I wanted to avoid being tax registered just because of all the headache, but obviously appreciate that.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Not everybody. Some people are. And we're not that far away, so we'll have to be soon. Unfortunately, I want to earn a little bit less. Actually, I don't really want to mess around with vat.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not too bad. And when we do it all through QuickBooks, you know, it's. It's.
- Them: Yeah, I use x0.
- Me: Yeah, and it's one invoice a month, you know? You. I presume you got payroll and stuff, though, to do?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So it makes it a bit more complicated. But they're selling. They're so straightforward, these. These systems now, aren't they, once you get it?
- Them: Yeah, xm is quite good.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Xd was quite good. And we got a good deal with our accountant. We did their website and our accounts.
- Me: Nice. I'll save you, bobby.
- Them: I didn't have to fork out money. She didn't have to fork out money, so it worked well.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Good.
- Them: It was lovely to chat to you.
- Me: I knew, mate.
- Them: Like I said, I'll forward you on this email from the client that I discussed. It'd be interesting to get your thoughts. If it's really something you don't want to do, then obviously feel free to tell me to bug her off. But it'd be interesting to get your thoughts and any sort of projects that come in PPC related. It'd be great to keep in touch.
- Me: Okay? Yeah. Fantastic. No problem.
- Them: And share them, and then if there's sort of that opportunity, it'd be good to collaborate.
- Me: At all. Did you? I don't know whether you've got my email address. Yeah, she did. Yeah. You did? Yeah, of course I did a meeting thing with you.
- Them: Think it'll be on this joint? Is it? Peter e at rosys co uk.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Perfect. Yes, I'll send the email to that when we get off the call. Even if it's not that one, I'm sure there'll be future chances to collaborate.
- Me: Fantastic. Awesome. Yeah, look forward to it, mate.
- Them: Yeah, Brilliant. Thanks a lot for your time, Peter.
- Me: Bye now.
- Them: Cheers. Bye.

Them: Hi, peter.
Me: All right.
Them: How are you? You okay?
Me: Can you hear me? No.
Them: Yeah, I can hear you.
Me: It's Monday morning.
Them: How you doing? You all right?
Me: Yeah, I'm good. Thank you very much. Yeah, not so bad at all.
Them: Brilliant. Thanks for hopping on a call.
Me: No.
Them: Obviously I messaged you because I come across you LinkedIn profile.
Me: Wait.
Them: And we were looking for someone to do. Basically, we do marketing strategy and we do web design, web development in house. We have someone that does ppc, but they're off poly at the moment. So we're just kind of using freelancers and subcontractors, so just trying to talk to as many people that can potentially help us out.
Me: A busy day, then.
Them: We've spoken to loads of people. Spoken to loads of people. It's quite important to me that they're UK based.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I don't want someone who's in a different time zone. Obviously, that very often delays projects, that very often there's multiple problems and also the language barrier.
Me: Yeah, absolutely.
Them: Can sometimes impact things. So, yeah, basically anyone that's UK based that can sort of help us, we're open to collaboration.
Me: Okay, yeah, that sounds good, mate. I mean, you've read LinkedIn, anyway. If you want me to give you a quick overview of what I'm doing at the moment,
Them: Yes, please.
Me: So I have 11 clients at the moment.
Them: Yeah.
Me: SEM. So yes, I would say that wrong SMEs and no, I do SEM. I've been doing Google Ads for 25 years now. God. I started off with my own business. That's how I applied my trade, then went client side and then I've been freelancing for 15 years. Most of my clients are through referrals. I don't actively go out and get clients, which, you know, you would if you look back over 15 years. I've not exactly been living life on the edge either. I've not struggled to find people.
Them: That speaks volumes.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you want recommendations to people, if you ever want to speak to any of my clients, then you're more than welcome to. I think the one thing I say to my clients is that the. The edge that I give them is the fact I've done this myself. I've been spending my own money in the past. And now the thing that keeps me up at night is I'm still spending my own money. So. But that's multiplied by however many clients have got. So it gives it a bit of a. It gives it a bit of an edge. You know, the. I view this. I don't view this from, oh, isn't this a pretty little campaign structure? And it's doing this new thing. And that new thing. What I do is I adopt the new technologies.
Them: Yeah.
Me: To reach a goal, which is to make money for the clients. Because.
Them: That's what pays for us, isn't it? That's what pays for me and you.
Me: Very much so, yeah.
Them: That's what the client cares about.
Me: It is. And I'm speaking to the business owner typically. So I do know that, you know, I do have to justify my existence, really, you know, because I'm looking at. I'm looking at profit for the, for the month and say, well, take my bit out of that, and then what's left for the client. Are they going to be happy with that? The latest thing is it's been quite weird over the last couple of weeks. I've. I put all my Google rep meetings pretty much on hold.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Number one, because the boring is sin. They're not telling me anything new at all. And the other one, I've been developed. I've just been getting heavily into AI really, really heavily into it. So I've developed, now developed a system which is all about collating all together, all the information I know. About my clients. Collating together all the information I know about Google Ads, about experiments, new tests I can do. I'm just trying to work smart with it. It's kind of blowing my brain a little bit because it is, and I call it Pete's Brain, it is literally dumping everything I know into one central repository. So. I've built that structure up. It makes it so that in the future, things like this one, I'm onboarding someone. I can just say, well, tell me what you know about the client. You know, have you got any documentation on the client, anything at all that will help me understand them and get this up and. Running as quickly as possible. They do an audit and actually look back. Not just the structure, because, I mean, the structured speech volumes anyway, but little back over the change log, see what's happened recently, see what we need to be keeping an eye on. And it's that kind of stuff, that level of granularity we've always wanted. To do, haven't we? And we've never had the time to do it. We know what the best practices. But do you really know things like what impact did it have a product going out of stock?
Them: Yeah.
Me: What's the real impact of that? The impact of a price change on a product. Keeping track of disapprovals and things like that, they're so difficult to do, but with some sort of AI system, I can have it popped up in front of me, say, look, this has happened and I can use my best skill. And judgment to actually say, well, actually, we need to do that now. And away we go.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: You know, taking the analysis out of it. So it's sweet. It's really sweet.
Them: It's really good. Yeah, we use AI quite a lot.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So we have a client. They do safety barriers.
Me: Okay?
Them: We've been doing a pay lad for them.
Me: I have excited the safety barriers.
Them: Okay. What's the company called, if you don't mind me asking?
Me: Ace called crowd control.
Them: Okay. How's this called? West Yorkshire safety barriers.
Me: Okay?
Them: We've been working with him for over a year as an agency. He came to us. With a website that needed urgent assistance. It was done by someone who was a teacher. Become marketing guy, and he didn't really know what he was doing. With all due respect to him. Put something together. And I said to him, we need to improve the website. We did a bit of SEO work for him and a bit of work on Google, and he got a few sales. But I said to him, look, it could be so much better if we improved the website. So we improved the website for him. Built a new website, and then we started doing SEO on that. But we also did some Google Ads.
Me: Right.
Them: So we did some Google Ads, and what we know, something just wasn't hitting the spot. We were getting a lot of visitors to the website. The numbers looked good, but then there was, like, literally no conversions.
Me: Wow.
Them: There's something wrong here. Went on and asked ChatGPT and it gave us some solutions and we sort of did it as a tick box. Thing. And I think we run another campaign since following that, we tweaked it a little bit, tweaked the website a little bit.
Me: Nice.
Them: The campaign's running better now. So it's really helpful identifying potential problems and thinking outside the box.
Me: Very much so, yeah.
Them: So we use it. We use it quite a lot.
Me: Yeah, yeah.
Them: So do you just do Google Ads, then?
Me: I do do Facebook ads. So I know how to do Facebook ads. I've run it for a very large client before. Do I like it? It would be easier now. With a bit of AI. I think the problem with Facebook. Were you referring to Facebook ads?
Them: So I was just saying. What do you do? Do you do Google Ads?
Me: Facebook ads. Yes, I can do. It's about content with Facebook ads. And I think that's better driven from client side rather than me coming up with some ideas. It would be easier now to just generate auto generate it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I do do Microsoft ads as well. I've done Amazon ads in the past. I absolutely hate it. I really don't want to do it again. Amazon's sucking the life blood out of everybody, so I'd rather stay clear of it. I've got one client I'm doing Amazons for at the moment and. You're just working for Amazon. Really?
Them: I think we have a lot of clients that sell on Amazon.
Me: Yeah.
Them: For example, we've got a workwear client, and I think 50% of his revenue comes from selling on Amazon. And it's not a case of you can't beat it, you can't. So you've got to be on there. But we're trying to find ways to pull them from Amazon and directly order with them. But then they have all these rules, don't they, that you can't put. Branded stuff in there because obviously they're not ordered through Amazon. So we're trying to find ways around it that kind of don't break the rules.
Me: Own the client. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Them: Of Amazon. You can't beat them, but I always try and get them away and advertise on Google. Especially if it's a product like Google shopping ads and things like that, to try and pull them away from Amazon a little bit.
Me: I think the. I mean, it was a lovely. When Amazon dropped off for a month, that was just sweet. It really was. I mean, they still offer. I think they're still off in the US but it was just nice when they did it. And it's all well and good. The client's saying we do 50% of our revenue on Amazon. They say, well, what percentage of your profit is on Amazon?
Them: Yeah, very little.
Me: No. And we need to look about fba costs. Well, just FBA cost on their own are an absolute fortune. But you've got to be doing FBA to do prime.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And then Amazon are the ultimate of pay to play. If you suddenly start doing paid ads. Well, all of a sudden, my organic results are doing really well. I use Amazon a hell of a lot because it's just so easy. I'm not going to tell that to only a few people, but. If you do a search on Amazon now, it's not relevant what you get back. Is it? It's all just the ads at the top. It's not relevant in the slightest.
Them: No, I've noticed that they do a lot of paid a lot more paid ads and they push the paid ads more and get it some revenue stream. And being in marketing, I completely understand why they're doing it.
Me: Yeah. Clutters, aren't they?
Them: A lot of the stuff we do is Google Ads for clients. Facebook ads is something that we offer, but it's not something we get. Very often. The reason I was searching specifically for Facebook ads, which is what led me to your profile, was basically a networking friend of mine. They offer, like, AI software for ads and things like that.
Me: Okay?
Them: But basically they're wanting to run a Facebook ad. And I've basically said, yeah, we can probably help, but what they want is basically us to just set it up. And then just leave it. They don't want to pay, like, a massive retainer.
Me: Right.
Them: So they've got a budget of, I think I said, about 20 pound per day. And they want the ad so that it goes to their messenger, so that their AI software can automatically respond. So I just wanted to get. To get your thoughts on that and to see if that is something that you'd be able. To help with because it's not something I personally am an expert in. And at the moment, we don't have the capacity to do it in house, but I've kind of already half said, yeah.
Me: I mean, and it's kind of. That kind of is a really difficult question to answer because the actual answer to it is, no, I wouldn't touch it with the barge pole. But at the end of the day, you know, if it smooths the flow of the. Of the. Of a. A relationship between us, then. I would look at it. For definite, you know, I can help to set it up. So long as there's no responsibility for the results that come back from it, then that's fine. You know, if it's mechanics, then, and they. And they can be forthcoming with, you know, who they're actually targeting, then fine. I don't. Mind doing that. But if you. If you were a customer that came to me, I'd say absolutely no chance.
Them: I've said that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if I forward. If I forward you her email.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Can you share your thoughts with me on it? Because like I say, I'm strategy, I'm marketing strategy, and a little bit of SEO. I don't really do. My knowledge is not with ads. No, the very basics. And there's a few clients that I work with, and I think I know them well enough to do okay.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But she's pretty narrowed down in terms of who she wants to work, you know, who she wants to target, their interest, demographics, things like that. So that side is. Is a positive. But I was a bit like you. I said yes to her because she was a networking friend. And then when she sent me the details, I. Was like, oh, shit, how am I going to say no to her? But it'd be interesting to get your thoughts.
Me: It was the 20 quid a day thing that's really got me. You know, if you think. If you think of something like, so you're doing Facebook, AI.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And you want to target people who are doing Facebook. There's sort of competition you've got for that. It's going to be immense.
Them: It's quite high. Yeah.
Me: The first thought is as Dave, you if you're on a retainer, you'd be on a Harding to nothing. She's one of the reasons I say no, because I can't make that win.
Them: Yeah.
Me: The first thoughts on it are, you know, you're up against some big boys for that. They're probably better off building a Facebook.
Them: Yeah.
Me: A group of Facebook followers up, but also looking at LinkedIn, you know, actually targeting people on LinkedIn rather than talking to people on Facebook.
Them: Great. I. I actually suggested LinkedIn. Or LinkedIn or Google is what I said. You know, Google could be. Google could be a good platform, but they are, for some reason adamant that they want to do Facebook.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I'm just going to get her email up. Watch what she said. But that's how forward it to you. But it'd be interesting your thoughts on it.
Me: Well. I bet. Yeah, no problem. No problem at all.
Them: Just out of curiosity for projects. For example, this one. Would you be sort of flexible to being white label, if you like? So.
Me: I'd rather be white label.
Them: Right. Okay, perfect. That. That's good. Because we do. We like with the existing person that we use. Who's called Mark, we would say, right, Mark's going to be running this ad for you. To the client. We'd say, right, Mark's going to be running this ad for you. He's got access to an email address which is just PPC at Big One Marketing. And then we kind of say, right, you know, here's his email. This is how to communicate with him. We can kind of monitor it. But he's got access to it. And then we say, right, it's Mark from Big One Marketing. So he basically is white label.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, I don't have a problem with that. I suppose it's the difficult bit. It's the Google Ads bit, because I've got everything in my mcc. If it was a big one, marketing mcc, that'd be great.
Them: Yeah. We have a big one. Marketing.
Me: Great. Well, that will probably be the best way to go with it then, is to do is to do it like that. Then at least I can just flick between MCCs. Yeah, it's nice to own the client, but in this sort of situation, it also distances me a little bit from the client as well, so that they're not absolutely bombarding me, between you and me and SME is. Yeah, they are. I have a guy who. I've only just taken it on. It's doing brilliant. It's kids toys, so it's doing brilliantly. And I email him regularly with an update on where it's. Going and he's still. Ring me. He says I need to. I need to ring you every week. Well, why? I've told you all the details. He said, well, you just need to know how it's going and you're just going.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: I've told you how it's going, and then he rings you up and just tells you the same stories over and over again about how difficult it is in the business and just.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I could have done so much on your account and just do this call. I'm moaning, but you know what it's like, don't you?
Them: Yeah. Safety Barrier client that I mentioned. He voice notes me quite a lot on WhatsApp. So every day I'll get a voice note. Every day. I know his wife's name, I know his kid's name.
Me: Oh, how lovely.
Them: And I kind of like it to a certain extent because we've worked with clients in the past where they don't care. So we'll be sent to them. You know, we need this information. We need that information, especially with the social media strategy side of things.
Me: Yeah.
Them: We'll say, you know, we need this form of content. We need information about this. And it's like they don't. Some people don't care, but then you get others who care a little bit too much and bombard you too much. So obviously, as an agency, we will take that heat off yourself and things like that. How do you sort of cost things? Do you do it per project? Or do you do it based off of.
Me: Yeah. Cool.
Them: Hour.
Me: I used to do hours and I don't anymore. I do it based upon what value I think I can bring to the business, which is a little bit. I know it sounds a bit woolly, but it has to be that way because you are looking at it and go, can I make a difference here or not? I mean, nine times out of 10, the answer is yes. And it always takes the heat off me a little bit when I'm talking to the client doing the doom presales to say, I'll look at your account. I have no idea what I can do. I don't know what I can help. You or not, and typically speaking, the answer is yes. But at least they feel as though you. Well, I have looked at it. I have audited it. And I don't want to set myself up for failure in the future to look at it and go, I can't do anything. I'm just going to be fighting this guy off for three months and then. It's all going to go to it on a per client basis.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: I've set a limit now. I've set a bottom limit now of 750 per month. I don't go any lower than that. And again, between you and me, I will try and go as high above that as possible. If it's a client that's spending 20 grand a day, then I'm not going to do it for £750amonth. But in this kind of relationship, I also appreciate the fact we've both got to try and make some money out of it. So I am flexible, but not the 750.
Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Me: And I don't know where I sit in that. I have a friend who I actually taught paid search during the first place. He was a client. Now he does it himself for a number of clients, and he doesn't start below 1000. He says to me, bloody hell. But what you don't want to. Do is overcharge it, and then the expectation is a lot higher, isn't it, with the client?
Them: That makes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I think it depends on the client. I mean, when we. When we price things, we consider their daily budget. Obviously, like you said, they're spending 20 grand. You know, they've got some money.
Me: Yeah.
Them: We. We class on their conversion value. So, you know, if they're selling something like mugs, that's really cheap.
Me: Yeah.
Them: We can't charge that much because otherwise they're gonna have to sell 700 mugs just to pay us. We obviously consider things like if we've been working with a client, we can gather, they'll probably get a ring us that amount of time, take that time, that's the cost.
Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: But we're a similar price. Really? We start from 750 to 1,000. We're not that registered yet. Are you back? Registered. So would that be 750 plus that?
Me: Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes.
Them: Yeah, because we're not. Because.
Me: Yeah.
Them: As an agency. We're only a few years old and we've got two companies. Because I wanted to avoid being tax registered just because of all the headache, but obviously appreciate that.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Not everybody. Some people are. And we're not that far away, so we'll have to be soon. Unfortunately, I want to earn a little bit less. Actually, I don't really want to mess around with vat.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not too bad. And when we do it all through QuickBooks, you know, it's. It's.
Them: Yeah, I use x0.
Me: Yeah, and it's one invoice a month, you know? You. I presume you got payroll and stuff, though, to do?
Them: Yeah.
Me: So it makes it a bit more complicated. But they're selling. They're so straightforward, these. These systems now, aren't they, once you get it?
Them: Yeah, xm is quite good.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Xd was quite good. And we got a good deal with our accountant. We did their website and our accounts.
Me: Nice. I'll save you, bobby.
Them: I didn't have to fork out money. She didn't have to fork out money, so it worked well.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Good.
Them: It was lovely to chat to you.
Me: I knew, mate.
Them: Like I said, I'll forward you on this email from the client that I discussed. It'd be interesting to get your thoughts. If it's really something you don't want to do, then obviously feel free to tell me to bug her off. But it'd be interesting to get your thoughts and any sort of projects that come in PPC related. It'd be great to keep in touch.
Me: Okay? Yeah. Fantastic. No problem.
Them: And share them, and then if there's sort of that opportunity, it'd be good to collaborate.
Me: At all. Did you? I don't know whether you've got my email address. Yeah, she did. Yeah. You did? Yeah, of course I did a meeting thing with you.
Them: Think it'll be on this joint? Is it? Peter e at rosys co uk.
Me: Yes.
Them: Perfect. Yes, I'll send the email to that when we get off the call. Even if it's not that one, I'm sure there'll be future chances to collaborate.
Me: Fantastic. Awesome. Yeah, look forward to it, mate.
Them: Yeah, Brilliant. Thanks a lot for your time, Peter.
Me: Bye now.
Them: Cheers. Bye.
