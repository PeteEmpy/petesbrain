- 'Them: I''ve got uk, us, German, French, Italian, site links. I''ve got PMAX for
  all of those countries, headline subscriptions, long headings, and I''ve got RSAs,
  headlines, descriptions for all of those languages as well.'
- 'Me: Nice. Wonderful. Nice one.'
- 'Them: So all I''ll do is when we''re ready. Even next week or whatever. I''ll put
  those in to the sheet.'
- 'Me: I''ll be done by then. Today, mate. You got zombie.'
- 'Them: Yeah, because I''ve also got what I''ve done is on that first tab. Winter
  sale 2025p1. Is I''ve kept in a load of the bau ones, I call it.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: And then just added, On the headlines. There''s three sale headlines and
  11.'
- 'Me: Bau. That''s good.'
- 'Them: Brand ones. Yeah. And then. The descriptions are also mixed between brand
  and.'
- 'Me: Fantastic.'
- 'Them: So that''s all fine, that''s all good and worth. I think phase two is done
  as well because the other thing that changes there as it goes up to 60, and then
  I''ll work on phase three this week.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: And then really. We''re all sort of set. I just need to wait for the creatives
  to hire.'
- 'Me: Brilliant. Well, we''re looking. It''s looking okay. I think. I''ve just been
  doing some allocation ideas because earlier on. Well. Last week I''d shuffled a
  load of money around, and it''s worked.'
- 'Them: A good end to the promo.'
- 'Me: Definitely. From the 1st. The 13th we spent 87, 88, and it''s currently reporting
  4, 9, 4. Which will improve, obviously.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So the P8 final, we were 99.4% on target. But we spent 12 grand more. So obviously
  that''s changed what we got for going into. P9.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: We''re about right for spend at the moment. It''s very difficult to tell, but
  one of the. Because the big thing is, the big thing is going to be Boxing Day is
  getting everything sort of a Boxing day. That was phenomenal last year. So it''s
  just making sure everything''s ready for that. After the last order dates, I''m
  putting the Euro Wrestler world in the US down to 70% of budget. So they''ll just
  be ticking along and reallocate some money to the uk. The UK did all right on the
  last week. The UKs have been a bit of an underperformer. Say the least. But it has
  picked up the 11th and 13th. It''s actually improved. It''s got it by 77%. So the
  December, the 1st to the 10th, it was 389%. And now it''s just for the 11th and
  13th. It''s gone scooting up to 6:87. So I mean who could have predicted that? I''ve
  run everybody analysis now to man on this. Looking at last year and current performance
  and it still just decided to do what it wanted to do. But that''s good. We''re not
  going to be based upon the numbers at the moment. We''re not in million miles off
  last year. Boxing day. I mean, God, the uk was 1, 200%. Usa was 1600%. Europe was
  2900%. So they were all good. It''s just whether it''s going to be enough just to
  tick us. Knock over the.'
- 'Them: It''s the first. It''s the first proper. Commercial day post sale because
  obviously sale doesn''t go live until normally be about 6:00 on the Christmas Eve.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then Christmas Day, and you don''t really see much of a tickle. And then
  Boxing days, the first real kind of. Right. Everyone''s shopping again.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yeah. Well, let''s. Yeah, let''s see. Because I think we''re going to
  be. I mean, it depends which day it is. When I run this, I think we''re going to
  be 8% short of budget. Of revenue. Wouldn''t be bang on budget, but the revenue
  is going to be about 8% short.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Wow. I swear. The other channel is coming as well, isn''t it? Because
  the other problem is at the moment is even if we were on budget for revenue and
  spend, we''re still kind of just a mess in organic anyway. So organic revenues down.'
- 'Me: Is it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, so stuff like that. Pulls the total performance down anyway.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Right.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Which is? A separate issue, really.'
- 'Me: Well, yeah, we can only. We can only worry about what we can do about really.
  You know we can. This is in our hands. To. To do something with it is just a case
  of shuffling money around.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And just. Just fish where the fish are. As I say, it seems to be working. Europe.
  Europe''s been doing fantastically well. And it''s made up for the shortfall in.
  In the UK somewhat.'
- 'Them: Well, this is it, because we''re also. We weren''t really using translations
  as much, I don''t think, in Europe last year.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I think, apart from, like, for the actual sale. And for site links. I don''t
  think we were really translating much. I think it was all in English.'
- 'Me: Right. Arrogantly done in English.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Whereas this year. There''s a lot. Lot? All of our p maps at
  RSAs will be in the actual language.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yes. That''s got to be good.'
- 'Them: Which you''d expect has to be positive.'
- 'Me: Yes. Cool. Well, yeah.'
- 'Them: But yeah.'
- 'Me: So it''s going to be. So the next. The next big one is going to be cut offs.'
- 'Them: Yes, so you did. I sent that one across.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Usa is december the nineteenth.'
- 'Them: And let me double check. Let me double check. I''ve had about 15 versions,
  so let''s just see. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Oh, how do you.'
- 'Them: Let''s just see what I''ve got. Okay, so I have got to check the email schedule
  because that''s what we''re telling customers. It has been changes, right? So. Us.
  And. Try. And right. Us rest of the world on eu. Looks like it''s midnight. Of.
  The 16th.'
- 'Me: Oh.'
- 'Them: So basically, Wednesday morning. Or 1159 on the 16th.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I''ll do that. I''ll do that at six o''clock on. There. I mean, the us
  one''s okay. That''s a pain in the ass. Isn''t it? So the us. The US Then I''m going
  to have to. Should we. What, like a five hour shift or something? It''s going to
  be the morning, isn''t it? I''ll do the US in the morning, the rest of the world
  at night. No. Last orders midnight on the 16th.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Gmt.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So the US then, basically is 8 o''clock in the morning, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But the thing is, we''re telling everyone.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: The messaging is you order by 11:59 on the 16th. So even if you''re ordering.
  Like you''re in New York and you''re ordering after that. Whatever that is. You''re
  not. You shouldn''t be expecting to get it for Christmas anyway.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Because even if the ads are still showing, it doesn''t matter.'
- 'Me: So if we do the. So I. Okay, so. Yeah, because he''s not. He''s. No, it''s
  no great shakes for me. Apart from reducing the budget. So if I reduce the budget
  first thing on the 17th, To 70%. So we do that to 8am because I''m going to leave
  the Leave things running. I really don''t want to pause. 8am on this 17th, right?
  And then we''re back on again. On. Christmas eve. So on Christmas Eve, when you
  give me the nod, The sale is going to go on and the budgets are going to go back
  up again. Cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So it''s all go from. Well, whenever they. Go, which hopefully will
  be a lot sooner.'
- 'Me: Because every bugger wants to go home, don''t they?'
- 'Them: Well, I can imagine. Even seb wants to.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So 24th at 6pm budgets back up. And sale text. Right. That sounds like
  a plan.'
- 'Them: Now. I sent you. The phase isn''t nice. So I think we''ve got a little while
  until the first change. I''m just trying to clearly find all the stuff. Pin these
  messages, actually, so that''ll make more sense. Oh, yeah. There we are. Going to.
  Put that bomb. Sort of most recent one. S. Yeah, so we don''t do anything. So launch
  on the 24th and then we haven''t got to change anything until the 7th of Jan.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Which is good.'
- 'Me: Yes, I''ve got these. That''s exactly the one that you sent me before. Cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I just thought I''d put it down the bottom so I end up growling off
  the page otherwise.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Nice. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Which is good, because it means over Christmas, we can pretty much, you know,
  I can just monitor. Performance. I mean, I won''t make any changes. But it does.
  It means we''re not having to change anything.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay, one of the. One of the. So after the 20th of Jan. After 20 June.
  I think. Well. For the first three weeks of January, I''m going to seriously be
  thinking about how we can make this a lot easier. This has been really painful.
  Nothing that you''ve done. It''s just the way in which the campaigns are set up
  and where the ads are set up. There has to be an easy way to do this.'
- 'Them: I respect to, like, asset changes.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean.'
- 'Them: But to be honest, I mean, I''m happy to.'
- 'Me: Without you, mate. No, but you said yourself, if it''s specific, you know,
  language, product, whatever it is. If it''s specific, it makes more money.'
- 'Them: When I was.'
- 'Me: If. It. If. And. And in the past, it seems as though it''s been shied away
  from because it''s. It''s hard work.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: To do it. And it shouldn''t be that way. It should be just as. As. Just as
  well. It. It. It should be part of the. The general marketing process is, you know,
  things have changed. Okay, well, how does that affect bags? How does that affect
  pens? How does that affect diaries? And make it nice and easy?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: In that. That format. To be able to. To change things around. So that''s going
  to be the first three weeks in Jan, I think, thinking about that. Well, sorry. The
  not the first week, the second and third weeks in jam.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I mean, as I say, I''m gonna uniform everything, which I started to
  do anyway.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So that, you know, like I say, like the first 10 or first eight headlines
  on every PM at the campaign will always be brand and then what? Do you know what
  I mean? Like on the, on the, like, brand exact or whatever.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then we''ll have. Two or, you know, a few for season or one and a few
  for promos.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But it''ll always mean that the first ones you always see, like in terms
  of the order, they show headlines 1 to 6, but always be BAU brand, you know, 7 to
  10 will be seasonal, 11 to 15 would be promo.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it''s just making sure that you''ve got all those 15
  filled in. Because what. One of the. One of the issues I''ve. I''ve had is that
  some asset groups only have eight headlines. Some have 12. So it''s actually getting.
  When you know that it''s in position one at 12, for instance. That it starts at
  that point and then that becomes the company standard. Then is that''s the way it''s
  being done. That will make things a lot easier, then what I can do is then I can
  start to be doing analysis on those asset tags to see what works and what doesn''t.
  Because, you know, I mean, you. You''ve agreed before that the asset text isn''t
  the best.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Es.'
- 'Me: You know, it''s all. It''s. It''s been driven by marketing, and they''ve not
  necessarily known why they''re doing it. So if we can review that in January as
  well.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: And actually look at what we''re putting out, but base it upon, you know, I
  can get some stats together on how, how, how. What''s the click through rate on
  135 years of experience? You know, that, that kind of headline, which might scan
  well for the powers that be, but if it doesn''t actually attract a decent ctr, then
  what''s the point in having it. You know, it''s so that''s. That''s another job
  for January is to do. Is to do all that kind of stuff. I just have a proper spring
  clean.'
- 'Them: Yeah, exactly.'
- 'Me: You know, it just blitz it. You know, the, the, the site links leader need
  a good looking over as well, because I think a lot of them are just use account
  level site links, whereas we need to be looking at things like the bags category
  needs to have, you know, briefcases, travel bags, purses, wallets, as the site links
  because they''re pertinent towards that asset group or towards that. That search
  campaign. So, yeah, there''s. There''s a. There''s a bit to be done. Merry christmas.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And I think it''s. I don''t know if I''ve just not been privy to it
  because. I''m closer to detail now than I have been. But when we had the agency
  evolved, I don''t know what the thought process was in terms of the copy, but whether
  it was over box filling, boxed like filling exercise, or whether it was. Really
  thinking about how these messages read the end user searching and seeing. Yeah.'
- 'Me: In and out. That''s the thing. It''s in. In an ad, rather than just how it
  reads.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I, I''ve put some of these through through just bog stand analysis on what
  makes a good headline and it''ll just rip some of them to pieces because they''re
  just too generic, you know, they''re written by an 18 year old who just started
  in marketing and that''s not what we need. We need to be compelling. They need to
  have a high ctr, but we''ve got shitloads of data on it now.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And we''ve got loads of data on it, particularly to specific countries. You
  know, because what might work in the UK doesn''t necessarily work well in the, in
  the. In the US or in Europe. You know, and I hate to say it, but things like the
  European ones, we can just whack them through a translator and it''ll come up with
  some decent stuff.'
- 'Them: For some of these headlines. I''ve just, I''ve used chat GBT to say, what
  is the. You know, translate this from English to French and then I use Deepel to
  then just double check. Yeah, because I''m not always 100% with any translator.
  So I used within chat GBT and then verify debug or depot and then use chat GPT because
  obviously with chat GPT I can then get the. Is this a formal way of saying it? Here''s
  a less formal way. Here''s a way luxury brands say it. Because obviously, it''s
  like with every language, it''s five ways to say the same thing.'
- 'Me: There is. And it''s funny you say five because I use five different styles
  when I''m doing headlines. If I had 15 headlines, I''d split them up to five different
  types. So you have a. You have a brand one.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You have a technical one. You have a call to action. You have a quirky one.
  Was that 4 or 5? But there''s. There''s five. But there''s five different types.
  So. So, you know, you. Then you mix in and matching maybe a brand with a call to
  action. Because a lot of the time these, these things, like Shop now is just piss
  poor, isn''t it? You know, there''s no thought gone into that at all. But it''s
  just, you know. But a CTA can be. Can be. Come look at our range of briefcases.
  That''s a call to action. It''s telling someone what to do. So there is that. That
  mix and match stuff. And again.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I. I''ve got. I''ve got stuff written that we can. We can use to generate that
  kind of thing. And even if I say to you, well, look for this particular asset group,
  I''ve got these options. You pick whichever ones you want. These, these are the
  ones have been auto generated. By the, by the AI. And when I say auto generated,
  it looks at the landing page, it looks the tone of voice of the website, and it
  looks at what''s previously happened on there and what''s worked and what hasn''t
  and comes up with, with a list of 15 headlines and 15 descriptions. So I can give
  you those.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: For each one of the asset groups. And you can, you can say, well, okay, well,
  I like that one. I like that fits in with the brown. That doesn''t fit in with the
  brand. So it''s more of, you know, it''s, it''s a picker rather than you have to
  think about what''s from scratch. What you. What you''re going to be doing. So that''s
  a. That''s another option for going forward as well.'
- 'Them: Yeah, and I think that''s.'
- 'Me: You like chief copywriter.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I mean, I haven''t used the marketing team now since. But certainly
  it''s. Well, I mean, in a couple of weeks. I''ve been doing it since Lauren went.
  I haven''t got there once. All I do is I tend to look at. I use the website as the
  first reference.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So if willing to Notebooks. What are we saying about notebooks there? That''s
  generally quite a close guide to what I want to talk about. But then also I go around
  and have a look at other competitors and just kind of, you know, what, what call
  to action is today. Use what you know how. Talking about air categories as well.
  So people that are kind of in the same space as us.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Just to get an idea on kind of what else is out there. So, yeah, I haven''t
  touched marketing at all with any of this, even for the sale.'
- 'Me: Good.'
- 'Them: I''ve taken a couple of bits that looked all right from last year. Looked
  at other luxury brands and then looked at our website. And just really go from there.'
- 'Me: Well, I''m pleased you''ve taken on board what I''ve said about it in the past,
  that you know, there''s no point in flooding it with 20% off. I know that. I know,
  I know. It''s 20% off. You don''t need to tell me 15 times it''s 20% off. And it
  is just. It is using that intelligence at Google to say much with the person that''s
  coming along, and they seem to have looked all right, you know.'
- 'Them: Well, they also the one the ads I''ve seen. And maybe actually because Seb
  is very quick to if he sees. Any combination that he''s like, he''ll tell me. And
  he hasn''t done anything for a couple of weeks now.'
- 'Me: Nice. Nice.'
- 'Them: But certainly the ones I''ve noticed have the ones I''m being shown read
  really well, because they''re not like you say they''re not. There''s not 10 headlines
  with the promo in, there''s three.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And I end up seeing one and on with a nice brand message afterwards.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, yeah, I think we''re in. A good place. I just need to. For this sale
  stuff, I just need to find out when we''re going to get some imagery and then I''ll
  whack that. I''ll whack that in.'
- 'Me: The image. It''s the images that being the real. The real issue. Are really.'
- 'Them: They''re not that good anyway, to be honest. You know, the Black Friday was
  exactly the same as last year''s Black Friday. Thought was a bit of a cop out.'
- 'Me: What I would ask on the on the sale ones is if you have three sale images.
  Like the black Friday ones. That we could just add to everything. You know, literally,
  just, just say, I''ve got highlighter. I could do it in ads editor. Highlight all
  the asset groups and say, add those assets to those. Those campaigns. And.'
- 'Them: So, like a generic.'
- 'Me: Just does it at top level.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it probably will be. Generic winter sale.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Messaging that will be applicable for everything.'
- 'Me: Because the problem with the 20% off ones is they were too small, the writing
  was too small. The Black Friday ones are really good. You know, because it is right
  in your face. It''s telling you exactly what it''s all about. But the, the, the,
  the more recent ones, the, the, the actual tax has been too narrow. And if you think
  normally, if you''re like, if you''re looking on a, on a, a mobile. You''ve got
  an image. It''s. It''s tiny. What you. What you''re looking at. So if you''ve got
  an image of a. Of a product and then over the overlaying that with a text, you can''t
  actually get the message at all. The main. The main message comes from the text.'
- 'Them: Now. Yeah. I mean. Some of them. I mean, actually, we got the same issue
  on. They''ve got, like, a weird handwriting font that they use at the minute.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Which they use on email.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Assets. And I plan it. I can read it.'
- 'Me: No, it''s too narrow.'
- 'Them: On a desktop.'
- 'Me: Yeah. It looks like a pencil line almost, doesn''t it? Or a pen line. It''s
  that thin.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So I said to someone else, can you, like, what does that say? And even
  though you know what it says, Because you briefed it in. It''s like, no, I can''t
  read it. It''s like you''re not going to be able to see this. Let me just see if
  I can. Let''s see how.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: See that? Bottom? Bottom. The Christmas present with the handwriting.'
- 'Me: Jesus christ.'
- 'Them: I''m not expecting anybody to read it because I''m showing my phone. But
  like, that is not.'
- 'Me: It''s not a message, though, is it?'
- 'Them: No, but I have to squint to see it on my.'
- 'Me: I get the idea. It''s just if it was bigger, it might actually be better.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''s a disconnect between the idea is fine, but the execution is not
  really thought about. So they think about the idea and they create this image, but
  they don''t think about where it''s going to be seen.'
- 'Me: And that''s a great example that. Because most people don''t design for mobile
  anyway, do they?'
- 'Them: No. Which. Is super sacking on a fence really shouldn''t.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.'
- 'Them: It.'
- 'Me: With that one. If it was. If it was the same font, but it was just one line
  of. Of text, it might actually work because it''d have to be bigger then wouldn''t
  it occupy the same amount of space but just one line of text?'
- 'Them: Yeah, I mean, our fonts on there, but are tiny. I''m going to have to. Talk
  to about that. Don''t know. Give anyone half a chance of reading anything.'
- 'Me: How would the. How the shop''s done last week.'
- 'Them: I haven''t seen yet, but they were struggling. Which is why I said we might
  haven''t talked about last week. We could probably throw even if we had a limited
  budget for paid search. We''d have to be lifting up. Stores and perhaps three other
  channels as well.'
- 'Me: Right. Right.'
- 'Them: That''s the big one at the minute.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: But there''s nothing even in stores you can do about it. And then really,
  you just go wait for people to come in?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All the work''s been done in three or four. Well, the 12
  months prior to that, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.'
- 'Me: Anyway.'
- 'Them: Imagine. Yeah. But. No, I mean, otherwise. Yeah. Good. Pretty happy with
  last week, to be honest. I think overall, for at least for the website of the business.
  It was a good promo. Week. So now this week is like, you know, this is the sort
  of. Falls to the wall before everybody turns off. So we''re supposed to have an
  email promo for the US Going today, but on Friday night, the method we were using
  broke, so we had to pause all of that. So coming up with another solution. Then.
  Yeah. It''s going to be all on the uk, isn''t it, from Wednesday onwards.'
- 'Me: It is. And if it carries on with the roas that it''s on, I''ve not looked at
  the. The product distribution yet for the uk. To see what is selling, whether it
  is diaries or, you know, there''s a. There''s a good old mixture. I mean, it''d
  be nice if it was diaries. Because that might be more Christmas agnostic, though
  you''re still going to get that after Christmas.'
- 'Them: Well, campaign wise, it''s performing well.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: It''s still holding a decent. Decent rallies, to be honest, given that, you
  know, we''re talking everything. We''re talking about everything else at the minute.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Do you see that in just in the Google Ads dashboard under products.'
- 'Me: What''s that? The products that are selling.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yes, you can do yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Even in the US Top clicked last week was a diary.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Writing paper. Diary card holder. Diary card holder. Diary. Diary. That''s
  us. Anyway, so I was doing some work on that quick.'
- 'Me: Notebook, diary, writing paper, uk? No. Lots of diaries. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So I tend to. I quite like to flick between the product bit and the search
  terms and the insights and reports.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Like, just for a flavor of.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: What''s going on? Yeah. King''s writing paper for the uk. Last seven days.
  Does it? Let me. See? Can you see the number of units or conversions? Let me just
  see.'
- 'Me: Yes, you can do. It''s got conversions on the, on that table. You can also,
  when you, when you go on that product products tab, there''s a bit at the top that
  says products, categories, brands, product types and custom labels. You can go to
  product types on there and it breaks it down. And look, sorry, groups it a little
  bit more, so.'
- 'Them: Yeah, just elevate. Oh, yeah. Diaries and books.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Eight, 42.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So all notebooks last seven days, 67 diaries, 100 conversions. So you
  ever want just a little bit of a flavor of what''s going on, you can. You can look
  in.'
- 'Them: So product wise, I''ve got.'
- 'Me: The.'
- 'Them: 11 conversions on the first tab products. Got 11 conversions for the king
  writing paper.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: All right, hang on. So. The boss wafer notebook and Panama 14 conversions
  smise and 26 diary. 12. It''s interesting that. The top. 1, 2, 3. Four. Four are
  top five. Adaris.'
- 'Me: Three. You. Top one''s a notebook, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah, notebook. Yeah, notebook, Diary, paper. And then I''ve got an out
  of stock one. It''s not eligible.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: See, I''m going to steal some of that insight as well. That''s quite interesting.'
- 'Me: I could do you a quick bit of analysis if you want, mate, I''m here if you.
  I''ve got all this stuff in loaded up into my database. Have you ever want any analysis
  doing, just let me know.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I only tend to in these. In on these calls is when I try and attend
  to kind of find stuff because you end up speaking out loud and then looking at something
  else.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Then. So we got. That''s really interesting. Notebook, diary. That''s quite
  cool. I''m going to. Let''s see how I can. And that''s all campaigns as well. Actually,
  that''s quite interesting. So that''s probably the best way to look at it. Just
  look at the top. Top.'
- 'Me: Y. Es.'
- 'Them: Awesome.'
- 'Me: So you''ve got, say, you''ve got that. The product types, or, you know, if
  you wanted something a bit more granular. I mean, you could do all sorts of stuff.
  You know, just, you know, what''s the. What''s the. The. The best color? But bear
  in mind. It''s quite interesting looking at these things. And that what you''re
  looking at in the products screen is not what people have bought. That''s what they''ve
  clicked on.'
- 'Them: Well, but if I had the. If I look at conversions. Would that be true to what
  they''ve bought?'
- 'Me: No. No, that''s how many sales they were after. Someone clicked on an advert
  with that in it. So what I was going to say is you do tend to find sometimes that
  you''ll find red products. Are the most clicked on just because they''re more visible,
  they catch your eye on the screen. But once you get through to that page, if you
  click on that Top Boss wafer notebook, you might find that it''s not actually the
  Navy one that sells, it''s another one.'
- 'Them: Right, so the conversions. There were 14 conversions where the first click
  was on the smise and boss notebook.'
- 'Me: Correct. Yeah.'
- 'Them: That''s not 14. Yeah, that''s not 14 sales at that point up. That''s 14 sales
  that started. There.'
- 'Me: Correct. They might not sold any notebooks at all. There might be something
  on there that''s a sell up that''s more attractive than that.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.'
- 'Me: So bear that in mind a little bit, you know, when you, when you''re reporting
  it. And this is why I want to get the email, Beth, about the Axis 5 to Salesforce.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: Not heard back from. If he''s. If you see, could you ask her to have a quick
  look at it? I just need more information from her, just to be able to link it in.
  But then I can. I can look at things. What has sold.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Against what''s been advertised. And what is there an opportunity in there
  where you''d sell in lots of things? On the website. But I''m not really not. The
  ads aren''t firing off for it. So there''s a, there''s a, you know, there''s a bit
  of a gap analysis to be, to be done is to how we can improve that. Because I can
  manually promote a product, you know, I can give it a bit more air. You know the,
  if you, if you scan over to the right hand side in that. I don''t need the, the
  columns, but there''s a, there''s a custom label in there, Custom Label 3, which
  tells you which segment it''s in. Whether it''s in heroes, villains, psychics or
  zombies. So that tells you that the level in which it''s been promoted.'
- 'Them: Okay. Yeah, that''ll be interesting. Also from a. From a. Category perspective
  that that''s probably the next piece that I need to feedback in is category performance
  for the whole business. So. And see what kind of what''s either doing well that
  we can push more or what''s kind of really underforming that we either need to ignore
  or is there an opportunity for it as well.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. My suspicion, you look at the leather goods. I mean, I''m just
  scrolling down the screen now. I''ve not come across one yet. Oh, glasses case.
  Oh, there is a. You know, there''s a. There are a few briefcases. But they are very
  much. A Christmas product. You know, they''re a gifting thing.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: You know, it''s almost like you need to segment out the year, isn''t it? You
  know, you got diaries there, you''ve got your evergreen, your writing papers and
  your notebooks and so on, and then you''ve got your diaries, sort of like December,
  January, February, maybe. I don''t know. Go to February or not. But then the briefcases
  are really is just like a Christmassy thing, isn''t it? You know, at a time you
  got to look at the roas that you''re going to get out of it and is it really worth
  pushing the rest of the year? Do you just wind it up at Christmas.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: You know, you could say for fortune, just redirecting budget. I mean, that''s.
  It''s been a revelation for me. I''ve literally just been shuffling money around.
  Between countries, then in between the individual campaigns as well, just to. To
  get the best roas out of it. It''s not been a sort of like carte blanche kind of
  idea, but that there must be some seasonality and all that as well.'
- 'Them: Oh, 100%. Yeah. Yeah. And it''s just finding the time in. In between, isn''t
  it?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: To actually kind of do the. Do the it and then come up with the actions.
  That''s the bit that always gets. It''s kind of the first thing that gets put to
  the side, isn''t it, I think.'
- 'Me: Yeah. We have a new friend now, though, don''t we? I''m calling him Clara now.
  He''s not Claude anymore. He''s cl.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s true. Team of three.'
- 'Me: Apping. So to be honest, I''m a lot more optimistic, pessimistic, more optimistic
  now about. Getting to this target. I know. I mean, I can''t do anything about anything
  else in the business, you know, but the numbers have been put in front of us, so
  let''s go for it. And it''s. It''s not looking too bad.'
- 'Them: Well, I mean, yeah, this is it, because this channel''s. I mean, I was looking
  at the numbers now. I was doing a report as we''re talking, and even Europe one
  at the minute. Spend was flat on the year. But. Traffic plus 39 sales. Plus 189
  or paid. So four paid journals.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. There''s an opportunity. There is in is immense, absolutely immense.'
- 'Them: But this is what I want to build on for next year. Is Europe and rest of
  the world. Because the amount of effort to try and move the needle in the UK and
  US is quite difficult. We''re obviously try and do that, but. As I say, there''s
  quite a lot of. Obvious things that could be done in Europe and the rest of the
  world. That will get quite a big return. For a good, you know. For a good rise in
  most of it.'
- 'Me: Let me just show you these. This is just the last three days. I mean, that
  is just fabulous. Before. Well, the fabulous one was the UK because that''s the
  one with the, the biggest spend. But, you know, you look at the US and Europe, And
  they''re all limited by budget. I think one of the reasons the UK''s done so well
  is because they''ve moved money out of the UK and put it into Europe. And it''s
  just got to work a bit harder now. What''s going to happen when Europe stops on
  the. On the night of the 16th? I don''t know. What''s going to happen with the UK
  when I reallocate that budget? I don''t know. But I''m hoping it''s got enough momentum
  then, and it''s close enough to Christmas. That it will still perform the way it''s
  performing now.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''ll be the interesting one, won''t it? Is that UK gets all the
  juice for that last. That last? You know, four. Four days or so.'
- 'Me: Eighteenth to the 24th, basically. So it was 17 to 24th. And I''m not going
  to pull it back on the 22nd either. It''ll give it too much of a wobble if I do
  that. You know you''ve got last orders on the 22nd. I''m just going to leave the
  budget exactly as it is.'
- 'Them: That is it because also the search will determine if the amount of searches
  will determine on the spend as well.'
- 'Me: Demand. Yes. Down to demand. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: Definitely.'
- 'Them: I''d expect spend to drop down quite significantly anyway, just even just
  with the lack of searches that are going to.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: See. So, yeah, because I think. I don''t want to happen is I. I do want to.
  Obviously uk, US and EU is easier because. Even wrestle a while because there''s
  more time. Between.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Especially because EU goes live later as well. You doesn''t even go live
  on the 24th.'
- 'Me: Oh, does it not?'
- 'Them: Tuesday, the 6th of January.'
- 'Me: Oh, sorry. You got it on there? Yes, you have.'
- 'Them: So us and rest in a while have got a nice break where we can kind of move,
  spend down, rearlocate, and then slowly build it up for the 24th. UK can be a bit
  lights off. On the 21st, lights back on 24th if we''re not careful. I think it happened
  last year. They pretty much stopped everything. And then it took best part of a
  week to get everything back up and running again.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, yes, it''s just managing that curve. Isn''t it?'
- 'Me: I. Think I did something on that. Because I just need to put these difference.
  Last order dates. On. That''ll skew it. December, okay? So last year, 2024 phase
  phases. So last order week ROAS703, that was 15th to 22nd. The Christmas lull 23rd
  to the 25th, 945. Because your competition is going to just drop out.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Boxing day. 1500%. And then post boxing day. The 27th and 31st is 921. Very
  strong period. Very, very strong period. It''s so patronizing. This. Key insight.
  Christmas lull was not a lull in 2024. Terribly sorry. Let me just ping this over
  to you. Well, we''re pretty much halfway pointed. 88k spent 1st to 13th. And what?
  We''ve got 83 left.'
- 'Them: That''d be helpful for that. Last push into sale as well.'
- 'Me: Well, this is. This was. The thing with P8 was not to. We''d spent too much
  money at the beginning of P8.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It should have been held back until we got to a point where. Where historically
  the conversion rate increased. And then, and then went for it, then to just keep
  the thing ticking over and then, then throw the money in at the, at the time when
  it''s going to, it''s going to convert. So hopefully with P9, it will be. It will
  be able to do that.'
- 'Them: Well, I mean, given we''re halfway through that''s where we''re at, then
  it kind of suggests as much.'
- 'Me: I''m recording this. And then boxing day. Expecting between 1200, 1500 roas
  for this year. Four times higher than normal. It''s crazy, isn''t it? People spending
  so much money just on a very, very short space of time.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Well, it''s not cheap. Not too Gary. Is. It.'
- 'Me: No, no. But this is the. So this is the plan for the budget. This will. This
  is going to change a little bit because of those. I think I put the 18th for last
  order date for the U.S. but that''s the, that''s the way the budget is going to
  roll.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Whack it up on the 26th. That''d be nice. 135 grand on one day. And then I''m
  away on the 27th.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I can''t imagine. There''d be really anything. To.'
- 'Me: Well, these P10 to do, isn''t. There.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but that would come in the new year anyway, because a lot of people
  are off.'
- 'Me: But it''s whether we leave the budgets as they are. Running into that. I mean,
  I''m back at about the 4th or something. I''m taking my computer with me. I''m not.
  I won''t be off grid.'
- 'Them: What''s the drop in? So we go from 1-7-1963 to 1-41-double-08.'
- 'Me: So you have to compare.'
- 'Them: So you click yes, you could deal or you''re chasing your tower a bit in the
  last. It''s a five week period.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I''ll have a look at what the conversion rates were like last year. First
  two weeks in January. The whole of January. They split it out. Where are these budgets
  now going forward? Where do you keep them?'
- 'Them: In that digital marketing. Master. So.'
- 'Me: Is that you shared that with me, haven''t you?'
- 'Them: Yeah. We should.'
- 'Me: Emailed that video. There. We go. Patience, patience. Get. Into that. It''s
  a good neck exercise. This is like this all the time. I can''t get a wider screen.
  Just get a crick him in there. So what? Ppc costs. Is that what I''m looking at?
  That''s cost, isn''t? It. All right. Paid. Paid search. P10. 143471. And for that.
  What''s the demand figure on there? Google Ads demand revenue target, and we''ve
  got a demand figure. Roas and Google Ad through us. What is that? What does that
  roas relate to the 4.2?'
- 'Them: No, I. Ignore that. Ignore. Ignore this tab.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: See. I''ll give you the. The budget and then I''ll need to do. I''ll give
  you the demand. Later. Today. If you see. Do you see the green tab that says Digital
  Marketing?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: You click on that one? And then look at row 22. I''ve highlighted it in green.'
- 'Me: Got you.'
- 'Them: That''s the Google spends. So one form.'
- 'Me: 140. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s the Google spend. And what I''ll do is I''ll go in my budget
  sheets and all of the paid search revenue that was in the budget. Plus the additional
  revenue, and then I''ll give you that number.'
- 'Me: Lovely.'
- 'Them: As well.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But yeah, the key one is 141.'
- 'Me: 29th December. 1st February. Okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And then I''ve got the activity on row 15 as well, so you can see.
  What''s going on?'
- 'Me: Nice. I like that. Yeah.'
- 'Them: But yes, in any bit that''s missing in here is it doesn''t break down. I''ve
  got the weekly demand for the whole web channel and row seven. But I haven''t got
  an issue. What? The paid search demand is paid search demand budget is. So I''ll
  pick that out.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: And send it over. Or I''ll put it on that. I''ll update that page search
  tab, perhaps just to have the page search. Specifics in it.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But. Cool, all right. Oh, yeah. No, she''s quickly saying the compet search
  competitor AI campaign 600 pounds spent, 4.2k conversion value.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So if you please with that.'
- 'Me: Me. Let''s see.'
- 'Them: Says almost a 7 return on return on ice wind.'
- 'Me: I certainly wouldn''t run that outside. Peak.'
- 'Them: No, hopefully just get bored of it. Once they stop targeting us. But for
  now,'
- 'Me: I mean, It''s a. It''s 30 quid. You could spend three times as much as that.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it''s a vanity project for him, so we''ll just
  leave it as is.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I''m looking. Last seven days, I''m seeing nine. 49,
  41. Roas. For the uk.'
- 'Them: N. Ice.'
- 'Me: 180 quid. 1700 pounds in revenue.'
- 'Them: That''s this last week, then that it''s really picked up.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: The week before was shit for the UK. It really was poor. It was under 400%.
  And it''s just been in this last week. I. I don''t know whether it''s a sale that''s
  done it. Proximity to Christmas. You know, it''s like the. It''s like the. You know,
  the rules of. Of experimentation don''t change more than one thing at a time. But
  at the end of the day, the sale''s gone on and it''s got closer to Christmas. So
  it''s one of those that''s made the difference.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: And who cares? You know, if it''s done it, it''s done it.'
- 'Them: No. Well, quite. Yeah. Not really bothered. Where or why, but. Yeah, certainly
  on the year, it''s doing pretty well.'
- 'Me: Would last seven days. It''s. It would 9% down on roas. But if you look at
  Roas by time. Rather than the 30 day cookie. It''s. It''s well up. It''s 22% up.
  So it''s like. It''s like the revenue figure for pH. We''re reporting on it. Go.
  Yeah, it didn''t actually make it, and we''ve pretty much done it. It''s. It''s
  hit the. It''s hit the target. But with an extra 12 gram to spend.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So it''s whether we can get this, pull this round, I don''t know. We''ll see.'
- 'Them: Could be a good Christmas after. All.'
- 'Me: Goodbye. Yes.'
- 'Them: Right. I''ve got to shoot to another meeting. So, yes, I think the only two
  bits I need to get over to you is I''ll give Beth a nudge. And then. I will just
  confirm the demand budget targets.'
- 'Me: Wonderful. Thank you. Very much.'
- 'Them: Note. Cool. All right, switching.'
- 'Me: Catch you later.'

- Them: I've got uk, us, German, French, Italian, site links. I've got PMAX for all of those countries, headline subscriptions, long headings, and I've got RSAs, headlines, descriptions for all of those languages as well.
- Me: Nice. Wonderful. Nice one.
- Them: So all I'll do is when we're ready. Even next week or whatever. I'll put those in to the sheet.
- Me: I'll be done by then. Today, mate. You got zombie.
- Them: Yeah, because I've also got what I've done is on that first tab. Winter sale 2025p1. Is I've kept in a load of the bau ones, I call it.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: And then just added, On the headlines. There's three sale headlines and 11.
- Me: Bau. That's good.
- Them: Brand ones. Yeah. And then. The descriptions are also mixed between brand and.
- Me: Fantastic.
- Them: So that's all fine, that's all good and worth. I think phase two is done as well because the other thing that changes there as it goes up to 60, and then I'll work on phase three this week.
- Me: Great.
- Them: And then really. We're all sort of set. I just need to wait for the creatives to hire.
- Me: Brilliant. Well, we're looking. It's looking okay. I think. I've just been doing some allocation ideas because earlier on. Well. Last week I'd shuffled a load of money around, and it's worked.
- Them: A good end to the promo.
- Me: Definitely. From the 1st. The 13th we spent 87, 88, and it's currently reporting 4, 9, 4. Which will improve, obviously.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So the P8 final, we were 99.4% on target. But we spent 12 grand more. So obviously that's changed what we got for going into. P9.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: We're about right for spend at the moment. It's very difficult to tell, but one of the. Because the big thing is, the big thing is going to be Boxing Day is getting everything sort of a Boxing day. That was phenomenal last year. So it's just making sure everything's ready for that. After the last order dates, I'm putting the Euro Wrestler world in the US down to 70% of budget. So they'll just be ticking along and reallocate some money to the uk. The UK did all right on the last week. The UKs have been a bit of an underperformer. Say the least. But it has picked up the 11th and 13th. It's actually improved. It's got it by 77%. So the December, the 1st to the 10th, it was 389%. And now it's just for the 11th and 13th. It's gone scooting up to 6:87. So I mean who could have predicted that? I've run everybody analysis now to man on this. Looking at last year and current performance and it still just decided to do what it wanted to do. But that's good. We're not going to be based upon the numbers at the moment. We're not in million miles off last year. Boxing day. I mean, God, the uk was 1, 200%. Usa was 1600%. Europe was 2900%. So they were all good. It's just whether it's going to be enough just to tick us. Knock over the.
- Them: It's the first. It's the first proper. Commercial day post sale because obviously sale doesn't go live until normally be about 6:00 on the Christmas Eve.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And then Christmas Day, and you don't really see much of a tickle. And then Boxing days, the first real kind of. Right. Everyone's shopping again.
- Me: Yes. Yeah. Well, let's. Yeah, let's see. Because I think we're going to be. I mean, it depends which day it is. When I run this, I think we're going to be 8% short of budget. Of revenue. Wouldn't be bang on budget, but the revenue is going to be about 8% short.
- Them: Yeah. Wow. I swear. The other channel is coming as well, isn't it? Because the other problem is at the moment is even if we were on budget for revenue and spend, we're still kind of just a mess in organic anyway. So organic revenues down.
- Me: Is it?
- Them: Yeah, so stuff like that. Pulls the total performance down anyway.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Right.
- Them: Yeah. Which is? A separate issue, really.
- Me: Well, yeah, we can only. We can only worry about what we can do about really. You know we can. This is in our hands. To. To do something with it is just a case of shuffling money around.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And just. Just fish where the fish are. As I say, it seems to be working. Europe. Europe's been doing fantastically well. And it's made up for the shortfall in. In the UK somewhat.
- Them: Well, this is it, because we're also. We weren't really using translations as much, I don't think, in Europe last year.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I think, apart from, like, for the actual sale. And for site links. I don't think we were really translating much. I think it was all in English.
- Me: Right. Arrogantly done in English.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Whereas this year. There's a lot. Lot? All of our p maps at RSAs will be in the actual language.
- Me: Yes. Yes. That's got to be good.
- Them: Which you'd expect has to be positive.
- Me: Yes. Cool. Well, yeah.
- Them: But yeah.
- Me: So it's going to be. So the next. The next big one is going to be cut offs.
- Them: Yes, so you did. I sent that one across.
- Me: Yeah. Usa is december the nineteenth.
- Them: And let me double check. Let me double check. I've had about 15 versions, so let's just see. Yeah.
- Me: Oh, how do you.
- Them: Let's just see what I've got. Okay, so I have got to check the email schedule because that's what we're telling customers. It has been changes, right? So. Us. And. Try. And right. Us rest of the world on eu. Looks like it's midnight. Of. The 16th.
- Me: Oh.
- Them: So basically, Wednesday morning. Or 1159 on the 16th.
- Me: Yeah, I'll do that. I'll do that at six o'clock on. There. I mean, the us one's okay. That's a pain in the ass. Isn't it? So the us. The US Then I'm going to have to. Should we. What, like a five hour shift or something? It's going to be the morning, isn't it? I'll do the US in the morning, the rest of the world at night. No. Last orders midnight on the 16th.
- Them: Yeah. Gmt.
- Me: Yeah. So the US then, basically is 8 o'clock in the morning, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But the thing is, we're telling everyone.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: The messaging is you order by 11:59 on the 16th. So even if you're ordering. Like you're in New York and you're ordering after that. Whatever that is. You're not. You shouldn't be expecting to get it for Christmas anyway.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Because even if the ads are still showing, it doesn't matter.
- Me: So if we do the. So I. Okay, so. Yeah, because he's not. He's. No, it's no great shakes for me. Apart from reducing the budget. So if I reduce the budget first thing on the 17th, To 70%. So we do that to 8am because I'm going to leave the Leave things running. I really don't want to pause. 8am on this 17th, right? And then we're back on again. On. Christmas eve. So on Christmas Eve, when you give me the nod, The sale is going to go on and the budgets are going to go back up again. Cool.
- Them: Yeah. So it's all go from. Well, whenever they. Go, which hopefully will be a lot sooner.
- Me: Because every bugger wants to go home, don't they?
- Them: Well, I can imagine. Even seb wants to.
- Me: Yeah. So 24th at 6pm budgets back up. And sale text. Right. That sounds like a plan.
- Them: Now. I sent you. The phase isn't nice. So I think we've got a little while until the first change. I'm just trying to clearly find all the stuff. Pin these messages, actually, so that'll make more sense. Oh, yeah. There we are. Going to. Put that bomb. Sort of most recent one. S. Yeah, so we don't do anything. So launch on the 24th and then we haven't got to change anything until the 7th of Jan.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Which is good.
- Me: Yes, I've got these. That's exactly the one that you sent me before. Cool.
- Them: Yeah, I just thought I'd put it down the bottom so I end up growling off the page otherwise.
- Me: Yeah. Nice. Yeah.
- Them: Which is good, because it means over Christmas, we can pretty much, you know, I can just monitor. Performance. I mean, I won't make any changes. But it does. It means we're not having to change anything.
- Me: Yeah. Okay, one of the. One of the. So after the 20th of Jan. After 20 June. I think. Well. For the first three weeks of January, I'm going to seriously be thinking about how we can make this a lot easier. This has been really painful. Nothing that you've done. It's just the way in which the campaigns are set up and where the ads are set up. There has to be an easy way to do this.
- Them: I respect to, like, asset changes.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean.
- Them: But to be honest, I mean, I'm happy to.
- Me: Without you, mate. No, but you said yourself, if it's specific, you know, language, product, whatever it is. If it's specific, it makes more money.
- Them: When I was.
- Me: If. It. If. And. And in the past, it seems as though it's been shied away from because it's. It's hard work.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: To do it. And it shouldn't be that way. It should be just as. As. Just as well. It. It. It should be part of the. The general marketing process is, you know, things have changed. Okay, well, how does that affect bags? How does that affect pens? How does that affect diaries? And make it nice and easy?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: In that. That format. To be able to. To change things around. So that's going to be the first three weeks in Jan, I think, thinking about that. Well, sorry. The not the first week, the second and third weeks in jam.
- Them: Yeah. I mean, as I say, I'm gonna uniform everything, which I started to do anyway.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So that, you know, like I say, like the first 10 or first eight headlines on every PM at the campaign will always be brand and then what? Do you know what I mean? Like on the, on the, like, brand exact or whatever.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And then we'll have. Two or, you know, a few for season or one and a few for promos.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But it'll always mean that the first ones you always see, like in terms of the order, they show headlines 1 to 6, but always be BAU brand, you know, 7 to 10 will be seasonal, 11 to 15 would be promo.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just making sure that you've got all those 15 filled in. Because what. One of the. One of the issues I've. I've had is that some asset groups only have eight headlines. Some have 12. So it's actually getting. When you know that it's in position one at 12, for instance. That it starts at that point and then that becomes the company standard. Then is that's the way it's being done. That will make things a lot easier, then what I can do is then I can start to be doing analysis on those asset tags to see what works and what doesn't. Because, you know, I mean, you. You've agreed before that the asset text isn't the best.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Es.
- Me: You know, it's all. It's. It's been driven by marketing, and they've not necessarily known why they're doing it. So if we can review that in January as well.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: And actually look at what we're putting out, but base it upon, you know, I can get some stats together on how, how, how. What's the click through rate on 135 years of experience? You know, that, that kind of headline, which might scan well for the powers that be, but if it doesn't actually attract a decent ctr, then what's the point in having it. You know, it's so that's. That's another job for January is to do. Is to do all that kind of stuff. I just have a proper spring clean.
- Them: Yeah, exactly.
- Me: You know, it just blitz it. You know, the, the, the site links leader need a good looking over as well, because I think a lot of them are just use account level site links, whereas we need to be looking at things like the bags category needs to have, you know, briefcases, travel bags, purses, wallets, as the site links because they're pertinent towards that asset group or towards that. That search campaign. So, yeah, there's. There's a. There's a bit to be done. Merry christmas.
- Them: Yeah. And I think it's. I don't know if I've just not been privy to it because. I'm closer to detail now than I have been. But when we had the agency evolved, I don't know what the thought process was in terms of the copy, but whether it was over box filling, boxed like filling exercise, or whether it was. Really thinking about how these messages read the end user searching and seeing. Yeah.
- Me: In and out. That's the thing. It's in. In an ad, rather than just how it reads.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I, I've put some of these through through just bog stand analysis on what makes a good headline and it'll just rip some of them to pieces because they're just too generic, you know, they're written by an 18 year old who just started in marketing and that's not what we need. We need to be compelling. They need to have a high ctr, but we've got shitloads of data on it now.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And we've got loads of data on it, particularly to specific countries. You know, because what might work in the UK doesn't necessarily work well in the, in the. In the US or in Europe. You know, and I hate to say it, but things like the European ones, we can just whack them through a translator and it'll come up with some decent stuff.
- Them: For some of these headlines. I've just, I've used chat GBT to say, what is the. You know, translate this from English to French and then I use Deepel to then just double check. Yeah, because I'm not always 100% with any translator. So I used within chat GBT and then verify debug or depot and then use chat GPT because obviously with chat GPT I can then get the. Is this a formal way of saying it? Here's a less formal way. Here's a way luxury brands say it. Because obviously, it's like with every language, it's five ways to say the same thing.
- Me: There is. And it's funny you say five because I use five different styles when I'm doing headlines. If I had 15 headlines, I'd split them up to five different types. So you have a. You have a brand one.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You have a technical one. You have a call to action. You have a quirky one. Was that 4 or 5? But there's. There's five. But there's five different types. So. So, you know, you. Then you mix in and matching maybe a brand with a call to action. Because a lot of the time these, these things, like Shop now is just piss poor, isn't it? You know, there's no thought gone into that at all. But it's just, you know. But a CTA can be. Can be. Come look at our range of briefcases. That's a call to action. It's telling someone what to do. So there is that. That mix and match stuff. And again.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I. I've got. I've got stuff written that we can. We can use to generate that kind of thing. And even if I say to you, well, look for this particular asset group, I've got these options. You pick whichever ones you want. These, these are the ones have been auto generated. By the, by the AI. And when I say auto generated, it looks at the landing page, it looks the tone of voice of the website, and it looks at what's previously happened on there and what's worked and what hasn't and comes up with, with a list of 15 headlines and 15 descriptions. So I can give you those.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: For each one of the asset groups. And you can, you can say, well, okay, well, I like that one. I like that fits in with the brown. That doesn't fit in with the brand. So it's more of, you know, it's, it's a picker rather than you have to think about what's from scratch. What you. What you're going to be doing. So that's a. That's another option for going forward as well.
- Them: Yeah, and I think that's.
- Me: You like chief copywriter.
- Them: Yeah. I mean, I haven't used the marketing team now since. But certainly it's. Well, I mean, in a couple of weeks. I've been doing it since Lauren went. I haven't got there once. All I do is I tend to look at. I use the website as the first reference.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So if willing to Notebooks. What are we saying about notebooks there? That's generally quite a close guide to what I want to talk about. But then also I go around and have a look at other competitors and just kind of, you know, what, what call to action is today. Use what you know how. Talking about air categories as well. So people that are kind of in the same space as us.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Just to get an idea on kind of what else is out there. So, yeah, I haven't touched marketing at all with any of this, even for the sale.
- Me: Good.
- Them: I've taken a couple of bits that looked all right from last year. Looked at other luxury brands and then looked at our website. And just really go from there.
- Me: Well, I'm pleased you've taken on board what I've said about it in the past, that you know, there's no point in flooding it with 20% off. I know that. I know, I know. It's 20% off. You don't need to tell me 15 times it's 20% off. And it is just. It is using that intelligence at Google to say much with the person that's coming along, and they seem to have looked all right, you know.
- Them: Well, they also the one the ads I've seen. And maybe actually because Seb is very quick to if he sees. Any combination that he's like, he'll tell me. And he hasn't done anything for a couple of weeks now.
- Me: Nice. Nice.
- Them: But certainly the ones I've noticed have the ones I'm being shown read really well, because they're not like you say they're not. There's not 10 headlines with the promo in, there's three.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And I end up seeing one and on with a nice brand message afterwards.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, yeah, I think we're in. A good place. I just need to. For this sale stuff, I just need to find out when we're going to get some imagery and then I'll whack that. I'll whack that in.
- Me: The image. It's the images that being the real. The real issue. Are really.
- Them: They're not that good anyway, to be honest. You know, the Black Friday was exactly the same as last year's Black Friday. Thought was a bit of a cop out.
- Me: What I would ask on the on the sale ones is if you have three sale images. Like the black Friday ones. That we could just add to everything. You know, literally, just, just say, I've got highlighter. I could do it in ads editor. Highlight all the asset groups and say, add those assets to those. Those campaigns. And.
- Them: So, like a generic.
- Me: Just does it at top level.
- Them: Yeah, it probably will be. Generic winter sale.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Messaging that will be applicable for everything.
- Me: Because the problem with the 20% off ones is they were too small, the writing was too small. The Black Friday ones are really good. You know, because it is right in your face. It's telling you exactly what it's all about. But the, the, the, the more recent ones, the, the, the actual tax has been too narrow. And if you think normally, if you're like, if you're looking on a, on a, a mobile. You've got an image. It's. It's tiny. What you. What you're looking at. So if you've got an image of a. Of a product and then over the overlaying that with a text, you can't actually get the message at all. The main. The main message comes from the text.
- Them: Now. Yeah. I mean. Some of them. I mean, actually, we got the same issue on. They've got, like, a weird handwriting font that they use at the minute.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Which they use on email.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Assets. And I plan it. I can read it.
- Me: No, it's too narrow.
- Them: On a desktop.
- Me: Yeah. It looks like a pencil line almost, doesn't it? Or a pen line. It's that thin.
- Them: Yeah. So I said to someone else, can you, like, what does that say? And even though you know what it says, Because you briefed it in. It's like, no, I can't read it. It's like you're not going to be able to see this. Let me just see if I can. Let's see how.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: See that? Bottom? Bottom. The Christmas present with the handwriting.
- Me: Jesus christ.
- Them: I'm not expecting anybody to read it because I'm showing my phone. But like, that is not.
- Me: It's not a message, though, is it?
- Them: No, but I have to squint to see it on my.
- Me: I get the idea. It's just if it was bigger, it might actually be better.
- Them: Yeah, it's a disconnect between the idea is fine, but the execution is not really thought about. So they think about the idea and they create this image, but they don't think about where it's going to be seen.
- Me: And that's a great example that. Because most people don't design for mobile anyway, do they?
- Them: No. Which. Is super sacking on a fence really shouldn't.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
- Them: It.
- Me: With that one. If it was. If it was the same font, but it was just one line of. Of text, it might actually work because it'd have to be bigger then wouldn't it occupy the same amount of space but just one line of text?
- Them: Yeah, I mean, our fonts on there, but are tiny. I'm going to have to. Talk to about that. Don't know. Give anyone half a chance of reading anything.
- Me: How would the. How the shop's done last week.
- Them: I haven't seen yet, but they were struggling. Which is why I said we might haven't talked about last week. We could probably throw even if we had a limited budget for paid search. We'd have to be lifting up. Stores and perhaps three other channels as well.
- Me: Right. Right.
- Them: That's the big one at the minute.
- Me: Right.
- Them: But there's nothing even in stores you can do about it. And then really, you just go wait for people to come in?
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All the work's been done in three or four. Well, the 12 months prior to that, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
- Me: Anyway.
- Them: Imagine. Yeah. But. No, I mean, otherwise. Yeah. Good. Pretty happy with last week, to be honest. I think overall, for at least for the website of the business. It was a good promo. Week. So now this week is like, you know, this is the sort of. Falls to the wall before everybody turns off. So we're supposed to have an email promo for the US Going today, but on Friday night, the method we were using broke, so we had to pause all of that. So coming up with another solution. Then. Yeah. It's going to be all on the uk, isn't it, from Wednesday onwards.
- Me: It is. And if it carries on with the roas that it's on, I've not looked at the. The product distribution yet for the uk. To see what is selling, whether it is diaries or, you know, there's a. There's a good old mixture. I mean, it'd be nice if it was diaries. Because that might be more Christmas agnostic, though you're still going to get that after Christmas.
- Them: Well, campaign wise, it's performing well.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: It's still holding a decent. Decent rallies, to be honest, given that, you know, we're talking everything. We're talking about everything else at the minute.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Do you see that in just in the Google Ads dashboard under products.
- Me: What's that? The products that are selling.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Yes, you can do yeah, yeah.
- Them: Yeah. Even in the US Top clicked last week was a diary.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Writing paper. Diary card holder. Diary card holder. Diary. Diary. That's us. Anyway, so I was doing some work on that quick.
- Me: Notebook, diary, writing paper, uk? No. Lots of diaries. Yeah.
- Them: So I tend to. I quite like to flick between the product bit and the search terms and the insights and reports.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Like, just for a flavor of.
- Me: Yeah, yeah.
- Them: What's going on? Yeah. King's writing paper for the uk. Last seven days. Does it? Let me. See? Can you see the number of units or conversions? Let me just see.
- Me: Yes, you can do. It's got conversions on the, on that table. You can also, when you, when you go on that product products tab, there's a bit at the top that says products, categories, brands, product types and custom labels. You can go to product types on there and it breaks it down. And look, sorry, groups it a little bit more, so.
- Them: Yeah, just elevate. Oh, yeah. Diaries and books.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Eight, 42.
- Me: Yeah. So all notebooks last seven days, 67 diaries, 100 conversions. So you ever want just a little bit of a flavor of what's going on, you can. You can look in.
- Them: So product wise, I've got.
- Me: The.
- Them: 11 conversions on the first tab products. Got 11 conversions for the king writing paper.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: All right, hang on. So. The boss wafer notebook and Panama 14 conversions smise and 26 diary. 12. It's interesting that. The top. 1, 2, 3. Four. Four are top five. Adaris.
- Me: Three. You. Top one's a notebook, isn't it?
- Them: Oh, yeah, notebook. Yeah, notebook, Diary, paper. And then I've got an out of stock one. It's not eligible.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: See, I'm going to steal some of that insight as well. That's quite interesting.
- Me: I could do you a quick bit of analysis if you want, mate, I'm here if you. I've got all this stuff in loaded up into my database. Have you ever want any analysis doing, just let me know.
- Them: Yeah, I only tend to in these. In on these calls is when I try and attend to kind of find stuff because you end up speaking out loud and then looking at something else.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Then. So we got. That's really interesting. Notebook, diary. That's quite cool. I'm going to. Let's see how I can. And that's all campaigns as well. Actually, that's quite interesting. So that's probably the best way to look at it. Just look at the top. Top.
- Me: Y. Es.
- Them: Awesome.
- Me: So you've got, say, you've got that. The product types, or, you know, if you wanted something a bit more granular. I mean, you could do all sorts of stuff. You know, just, you know, what's the. What's the. The. The best color? But bear in mind. It's quite interesting looking at these things. And that what you're looking at in the products screen is not what people have bought. That's what they've clicked on.
- Them: Well, but if I had the. If I look at conversions. Would that be true to what they've bought?
- Me: No. No, that's how many sales they were after. Someone clicked on an advert with that in it. So what I was going to say is you do tend to find sometimes that you'll find red products. Are the most clicked on just because they're more visible, they catch your eye on the screen. But once you get through to that page, if you click on that Top Boss wafer notebook, you might find that it's not actually the Navy one that sells, it's another one.
- Them: Right, so the conversions. There were 14 conversions where the first click was on the smise and boss notebook.
- Me: Correct. Yeah.
- Them: That's not 14. Yeah, that's not 14 sales at that point up. That's 14 sales that started. There.
- Me: Correct. They might not sold any notebooks at all. There might be something on there that's a sell up that's more attractive than that.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.
- Me: So bear that in mind a little bit, you know, when you, when you're reporting it. And this is why I want to get the email, Beth, about the Axis 5 to Salesforce.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: Not heard back from. If he's. If you see, could you ask her to have a quick look at it? I just need more information from her, just to be able to link it in. But then I can. I can look at things. What has sold.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Against what's been advertised. And what is there an opportunity in there where you'd sell in lots of things? On the website. But I'm not really not. The ads aren't firing off for it. So there's a, there's a, you know, there's a bit of a gap analysis to be, to be done is to how we can improve that. Because I can manually promote a product, you know, I can give it a bit more air. You know the, if you, if you scan over to the right hand side in that. I don't need the, the columns, but there's a, there's a custom label in there, Custom Label 3, which tells you which segment it's in. Whether it's in heroes, villains, psychics or zombies. So that tells you that the level in which it's been promoted.
- Them: Okay. Yeah, that'll be interesting. Also from a. From a. Category perspective that that's probably the next piece that I need to feedback in is category performance for the whole business. So. And see what kind of what's either doing well that we can push more or what's kind of really underforming that we either need to ignore or is there an opportunity for it as well.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. My suspicion, you look at the leather goods. I mean, I'm just scrolling down the screen now. I've not come across one yet. Oh, glasses case. Oh, there is a. You know, there's a. There are a few briefcases. But they are very much. A Christmas product. You know, they're a gifting thing.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: You know, it's almost like you need to segment out the year, isn't it? You know, you got diaries there, you've got your evergreen, your writing papers and your notebooks and so on, and then you've got your diaries, sort of like December, January, February, maybe. I don't know. Go to February or not. But then the briefcases are really is just like a Christmassy thing, isn't it? You know, at a time you got to look at the roas that you're going to get out of it and is it really worth pushing the rest of the year? Do you just wind it up at Christmas.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: You know, you could say for fortune, just redirecting budget. I mean, that's. It's been a revelation for me. I've literally just been shuffling money around. Between countries, then in between the individual campaigns as well, just to. To get the best roas out of it. It's not been a sort of like carte blanche kind of idea, but that there must be some seasonality and all that as well.
- Them: Oh, 100%. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just finding the time in. In between, isn't it?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: To actually kind of do the. Do the it and then come up with the actions. That's the bit that always gets. It's kind of the first thing that gets put to the side, isn't it, I think.
- Me: Yeah. We have a new friend now, though, don't we? I'm calling him Clara now. He's not Claude anymore. He's cl.
- Them: Yeah, that's true. Team of three.
- Me: Apping. So to be honest, I'm a lot more optimistic, pessimistic, more optimistic now about. Getting to this target. I know. I mean, I can't do anything about anything else in the business, you know, but the numbers have been put in front of us, so let's go for it. And it's. It's not looking too bad.
- Them: Well, I mean, yeah, this is it, because this channel's. I mean, I was looking at the numbers now. I was doing a report as we're talking, and even Europe one at the minute. Spend was flat on the year. But. Traffic plus 39 sales. Plus 189 or paid. So four paid journals.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. There's an opportunity. There is in is immense, absolutely immense.
- Them: But this is what I want to build on for next year. Is Europe and rest of the world. Because the amount of effort to try and move the needle in the UK and US is quite difficult. We're obviously try and do that, but. As I say, there's quite a lot of. Obvious things that could be done in Europe and the rest of the world. That will get quite a big return. For a good, you know. For a good rise in most of it.
- Me: Let me just show you these. This is just the last three days. I mean, that is just fabulous. Before. Well, the fabulous one was the UK because that's the one with the, the biggest spend. But, you know, you look at the US and Europe, And they're all limited by budget. I think one of the reasons the UK's done so well is because they've moved money out of the UK and put it into Europe. And it's just got to work a bit harder now. What's going to happen when Europe stops on the. On the night of the 16th? I don't know. What's going to happen with the UK when I reallocate that budget? I don't know. But I'm hoping it's got enough momentum then, and it's close enough to Christmas. That it will still perform the way it's performing now.
- Them: Yeah, that'll be the interesting one, won't it? Is that UK gets all the juice for that last. That last? You know, four. Four days or so.
- Me: Eighteenth to the 24th, basically. So it was 17 to 24th. And I'm not going to pull it back on the 22nd either. It'll give it too much of a wobble if I do that. You know you've got last orders on the 22nd. I'm just going to leave the budget exactly as it is.
- Them: That is it because also the search will determine if the amount of searches will determine on the spend as well.
- Me: Demand. Yes. Down to demand. Yeah.
- Them: So.
- Me: Definitely.
- Them: I'd expect spend to drop down quite significantly anyway, just even just with the lack of searches that are going to.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: See. So, yeah, because I think. I don't want to happen is I. I do want to. Obviously uk, US and EU is easier because. Even wrestle a while because there's more time. Between.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Especially because EU goes live later as well. You doesn't even go live on the 24th.
- Me: Oh, does it not?
- Them: Tuesday, the 6th of January.
- Me: Oh, sorry. You got it on there? Yes, you have.
- Them: So us and rest in a while have got a nice break where we can kind of move, spend down, rearlocate, and then slowly build it up for the 24th. UK can be a bit lights off. On the 21st, lights back on 24th if we're not careful. I think it happened last year. They pretty much stopped everything. And then it took best part of a week to get everything back up and running again.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, yes, it's just managing that curve. Isn't it?
- Me: I. Think I did something on that. Because I just need to put these difference. Last order dates. On. That'll skew it. December, okay? So last year, 2024 phase phases. So last order week ROAS703, that was 15th to 22nd. The Christmas lull 23rd to the 25th, 945. Because your competition is going to just drop out.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Boxing day. 1500%. And then post boxing day. The 27th and 31st is 921. Very strong period. Very, very strong period. It's so patronizing. This. Key insight. Christmas lull was not a lull in 2024. Terribly sorry. Let me just ping this over to you. Well, we're pretty much halfway pointed. 88k spent 1st to 13th. And what? We've got 83 left.
- Them: That'd be helpful for that. Last push into sale as well.
- Me: Well, this is. This was. The thing with P8 was not to. We'd spent too much money at the beginning of P8.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It should have been held back until we got to a point where. Where historically the conversion rate increased. And then, and then went for it, then to just keep the thing ticking over and then, then throw the money in at the, at the time when it's going to, it's going to convert. So hopefully with P9, it will be. It will be able to do that.
- Them: Well, I mean, given we're halfway through that's where we're at, then it kind of suggests as much.
- Me: I'm recording this. And then boxing day. Expecting between 1200, 1500 roas for this year. Four times higher than normal. It's crazy, isn't it? People spending so much money just on a very, very short space of time.
- Them: Y. Eah. Well, it's not cheap. Not too Gary. Is. It.
- Me: No, no. But this is the. So this is the plan for the budget. This will. This is going to change a little bit because of those. I think I put the 18th for last order date for the U.S. but that's the, that's the way the budget is going to roll.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Whack it up on the 26th. That'd be nice. 135 grand on one day. And then I'm away on the 27th.
- Them: Yeah, I can't imagine. There'd be really anything. To.
- Me: Well, these P10 to do, isn't. There.
- Them: Yeah, but that would come in the new year anyway, because a lot of people are off.
- Me: But it's whether we leave the budgets as they are. Running into that. I mean, I'm back at about the 4th or something. I'm taking my computer with me. I'm not. I won't be off grid.
- Them: What's the drop in? So we go from 1-7-1963 to 1-41-double-08.
- Me: So you have to compare.
- Them: So you click yes, you could deal or you're chasing your tower a bit in the last. It's a five week period.
- Me: Yeah. I'll have a look at what the conversion rates were like last year. First two weeks in January. The whole of January. They split it out. Where are these budgets now going forward? Where do you keep them?
- Them: In that digital marketing. Master. So.
- Me: Is that you shared that with me, haven't you?
- Them: Yeah. We should.
- Me: Emailed that video. There. We go. Patience, patience. Get. Into that. It's a good neck exercise. This is like this all the time. I can't get a wider screen. Just get a crick him in there. So what? Ppc costs. Is that what I'm looking at? That's cost, isn't? It. All right. Paid. Paid search. P10. 143471. And for that. What's the demand figure on there? Google Ads demand revenue target, and we've got a demand figure. Roas and Google Ad through us. What is that? What does that roas relate to the 4.2?
- Them: No, I. Ignore that. Ignore. Ignore this tab.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: See. I'll give you the. The budget and then I'll need to do. I'll give you the demand. Later. Today. If you see. Do you see the green tab that says Digital Marketing?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: You click on that one? And then look at row 22. I've highlighted it in green.
- Me: Got you.
- Them: That's the Google spends. So one form.
- Me: 140. Yeah.
- Them: Yeah, that's the Google spend. And what I'll do is I'll go in my budget sheets and all of the paid search revenue that was in the budget. Plus the additional revenue, and then I'll give you that number.
- Me: Lovely.
- Them: As well.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But yeah, the key one is 141.
- Me: 29th December. 1st February. Okay.
- Them: Yeah. And then I've got the activity on row 15 as well, so you can see. What's going on?
- Me: Nice. I like that. Yeah.
- Them: But yes, in any bit that's missing in here is it doesn't break down. I've got the weekly demand for the whole web channel and row seven. But I haven't got an issue. What? The paid search demand is paid search demand budget is. So I'll pick that out.
- Me: Right.
- Them: And send it over. Or I'll put it on that. I'll update that page search tab, perhaps just to have the page search. Specifics in it.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But. Cool, all right. Oh, yeah. No, she's quickly saying the compet search competitor AI campaign 600 pounds spent, 4.2k conversion value.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So if you please with that.
- Me: Me. Let's see.
- Them: Says almost a 7 return on return on ice wind.
- Me: I certainly wouldn't run that outside. Peak.
- Them: No, hopefully just get bored of it. Once they stop targeting us. But for now,
- Me: I mean, It's a. It's 30 quid. You could spend three times as much as that.
- Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's a vanity project for him, so we'll just leave it as is.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'm looking. Last seven days, I'm seeing nine. 49, 41. Roas. For the uk.
- Them: N. Ice.
- Me: 180 quid. 1700 pounds in revenue.
- Them: That's this last week, then that it's really picked up.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: The week before was shit for the UK. It really was poor. It was under 400%. And it's just been in this last week. I. I don't know whether it's a sale that's done it. Proximity to Christmas. You know, it's like the. It's like the. You know, the rules of. Of experimentation don't change more than one thing at a time. But at the end of the day, the sale's gone on and it's got closer to Christmas. So it's one of those that's made the difference.
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: And who cares? You know, if it's done it, it's done it.
- Them: No. Well, quite. Yeah. Not really bothered. Where or why, but. Yeah, certainly on the year, it's doing pretty well.
- Me: Would last seven days. It's. It would 9% down on roas. But if you look at Roas by time. Rather than the 30 day cookie. It's. It's well up. It's 22% up. So it's like. It's like the revenue figure for pH. We're reporting on it. Go. Yeah, it didn't actually make it, and we've pretty much done it. It's. It's hit the. It's hit the target. But with an extra 12 gram to spend.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So it's whether we can get this, pull this round, I don't know. We'll see.
- Them: Could be a good Christmas after. All.
- Me: Goodbye. Yes.
- Them: Right. I've got to shoot to another meeting. So, yes, I think the only two bits I need to get over to you is I'll give Beth a nudge. And then. I will just confirm the demand budget targets.
- Me: Wonderful. Thank you. Very much.
- Them: Note. Cool. All right, switching.
- Me: Catch you later.

Them: I've got uk, us, German, French, Italian, site links. I've got PMAX for all of those countries, headline subscriptions, long headings, and I've got RSAs, headlines, descriptions for all of those languages as well.
Me: Nice. Wonderful. Nice one.
Them: So all I'll do is when we're ready. Even next week or whatever. I'll put those in to the sheet.
Me: I'll be done by then. Today, mate. You got zombie.
Them: Yeah, because I've also got what I've done is on that first tab. Winter sale 2025p1. Is I've kept in a load of the bau ones, I call it.
Me: Yep.
Them: And then just added, On the headlines. There's three sale headlines and 11.
Me: Bau. That's good.
Them: Brand ones. Yeah. And then. The descriptions are also mixed between brand and.
Me: Fantastic.
Them: So that's all fine, that's all good and worth. I think phase two is done as well because the other thing that changes there as it goes up to 60, and then I'll work on phase three this week.
Me: Great.
Them: And then really. We're all sort of set. I just need to wait for the creatives to hire.
Me: Brilliant. Well, we're looking. It's looking okay. I think. I've just been doing some allocation ideas because earlier on. Well. Last week I'd shuffled a load of money around, and it's worked.
Them: A good end to the promo.
Me: Definitely. From the 1st. The 13th we spent 87, 88, and it's currently reporting 4, 9, 4. Which will improve, obviously.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So the P8 final, we were 99.4% on target. But we spent 12 grand more. So obviously that's changed what we got for going into. P9.
Them: Yeah.
Me: We're about right for spend at the moment. It's very difficult to tell, but one of the. Because the big thing is, the big thing is going to be Boxing Day is getting everything sort of a Boxing day. That was phenomenal last year. So it's just making sure everything's ready for that. After the last order dates, I'm putting the Euro Wrestler world in the US down to 70% of budget. So they'll just be ticking along and reallocate some money to the uk. The UK did all right on the last week. The UKs have been a bit of an underperformer. Say the least. But it has picked up the 11th and 13th. It's actually improved. It's got it by 77%. So the December, the 1st to the 10th, it was 389%. And now it's just for the 11th and 13th. It's gone scooting up to 6:87. So I mean who could have predicted that? I've run everybody analysis now to man on this. Looking at last year and current performance and it still just decided to do what it wanted to do. But that's good. We're not going to be based upon the numbers at the moment. We're not in million miles off last year. Boxing day. I mean, God, the uk was 1, 200%. Usa was 1600%. Europe was 2900%. So they were all good. It's just whether it's going to be enough just to tick us. Knock over the.
Them: It's the first. It's the first proper. Commercial day post sale because obviously sale doesn't go live until normally be about 6:00 on the Christmas Eve.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And then Christmas Day, and you don't really see much of a tickle. And then Boxing days, the first real kind of. Right. Everyone's shopping again.
Me: Yes. Yeah. Well, let's. Yeah, let's see. Because I think we're going to be. I mean, it depends which day it is. When I run this, I think we're going to be 8% short of budget. Of revenue. Wouldn't be bang on budget, but the revenue is going to be about 8% short.
Them: Yeah. Wow. I swear. The other channel is coming as well, isn't it? Because the other problem is at the moment is even if we were on budget for revenue and spend, we're still kind of just a mess in organic anyway. So organic revenues down.
Me: Is it?
Them: Yeah, so stuff like that. Pulls the total performance down anyway.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Right.
Them: Yeah. Which is? A separate issue, really.
Me: Well, yeah, we can only. We can only worry about what we can do about really. You know we can. This is in our hands. To. To do something with it is just a case of shuffling money around.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And just. Just fish where the fish are. As I say, it seems to be working. Europe. Europe's been doing fantastically well. And it's made up for the shortfall in. In the UK somewhat.
Them: Well, this is it, because we're also. We weren't really using translations as much, I don't think, in Europe last year.
Me: Okay?
Them: I think, apart from, like, for the actual sale. And for site links. I don't think we were really translating much. I think it was all in English.
Me: Right. Arrogantly done in English.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Whereas this year. There's a lot. Lot? All of our p maps at RSAs will be in the actual language.
Me: Yes. Yes. That's got to be good.
Them: Which you'd expect has to be positive.
Me: Yes. Cool. Well, yeah.
Them: But yeah.
Me: So it's going to be. So the next. The next big one is going to be cut offs.
Them: Yes, so you did. I sent that one across.
Me: Yeah. Usa is december the nineteenth.
Them: And let me double check. Let me double check. I've had about 15 versions, so let's just see. Yeah.
Me: Oh, how do you.
Them: Let's just see what I've got. Okay, so I have got to check the email schedule because that's what we're telling customers. It has been changes, right? So. Us. And. Try. And right. Us rest of the world on eu. Looks like it's midnight. Of. The 16th.
Me: Oh.
Them: So basically, Wednesday morning. Or 1159 on the 16th.
Me: Yeah, I'll do that. I'll do that at six o'clock on. There. I mean, the us one's okay. That's a pain in the ass. Isn't it? So the us. The US Then I'm going to have to. Should we. What, like a five hour shift or something? It's going to be the morning, isn't it? I'll do the US in the morning, the rest of the world at night. No. Last orders midnight on the 16th.
Them: Yeah. Gmt.
Me: Yeah. So the US then, basically is 8 o'clock in the morning, isn't it?
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But the thing is, we're telling everyone.
Me: Yeah.
Them: The messaging is you order by 11:59 on the 16th. So even if you're ordering. Like you're in New York and you're ordering after that. Whatever that is. You're not. You shouldn't be expecting to get it for Christmas anyway.
Me: Right.
Them: Because even if the ads are still showing, it doesn't matter.
Me: So if we do the. So I. Okay, so. Yeah, because he's not. He's. No, it's no great shakes for me. Apart from reducing the budget. So if I reduce the budget first thing on the 17th, To 70%. So we do that to 8am because I'm going to leave the Leave things running. I really don't want to pause. 8am on this 17th, right? And then we're back on again. On. Christmas eve. So on Christmas Eve, when you give me the nod, The sale is going to go on and the budgets are going to go back up again. Cool.
Them: Yeah. So it's all go from. Well, whenever they. Go, which hopefully will be a lot sooner.
Me: Because every bugger wants to go home, don't they?
Them: Well, I can imagine. Even seb wants to.
Me: Yeah. So 24th at 6pm budgets back up. And sale text. Right. That sounds like a plan.
Them: Now. I sent you. The phase isn't nice. So I think we've got a little while until the first change. I'm just trying to clearly find all the stuff. Pin these messages, actually, so that'll make more sense. Oh, yeah. There we are. Going to. Put that bomb. Sort of most recent one. S. Yeah, so we don't do anything. So launch on the 24th and then we haven't got to change anything until the 7th of Jan.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Which is good.
Me: Yes, I've got these. That's exactly the one that you sent me before. Cool.
Them: Yeah, I just thought I'd put it down the bottom so I end up growling off the page otherwise.
Me: Yeah. Nice. Yeah.
Them: Which is good, because it means over Christmas, we can pretty much, you know, I can just monitor. Performance. I mean, I won't make any changes. But it does. It means we're not having to change anything.
Me: Yeah. Okay, one of the. One of the. So after the 20th of Jan. After 20 June. I think. Well. For the first three weeks of January, I'm going to seriously be thinking about how we can make this a lot easier. This has been really painful. Nothing that you've done. It's just the way in which the campaigns are set up and where the ads are set up. There has to be an easy way to do this.
Them: I respect to, like, asset changes.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean.
Them: But to be honest, I mean, I'm happy to.
Me: Without you, mate. No, but you said yourself, if it's specific, you know, language, product, whatever it is. If it's specific, it makes more money.
Them: When I was.
Me: If. It. If. And. And in the past, it seems as though it's been shied away from because it's. It's hard work.
Them: Yeah.
Me: To do it. And it shouldn't be that way. It should be just as. As. Just as well. It. It. It should be part of the. The general marketing process is, you know, things have changed. Okay, well, how does that affect bags? How does that affect pens? How does that affect diaries? And make it nice and easy?
Them: Yeah.
Me: In that. That format. To be able to. To change things around. So that's going to be the first three weeks in Jan, I think, thinking about that. Well, sorry. The not the first week, the second and third weeks in jam.
Them: Yeah. I mean, as I say, I'm gonna uniform everything, which I started to do anyway.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So that, you know, like I say, like the first 10 or first eight headlines on every PM at the campaign will always be brand and then what? Do you know what I mean? Like on the, on the, like, brand exact or whatever.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And then we'll have. Two or, you know, a few for season or one and a few for promos.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But it'll always mean that the first ones you always see, like in terms of the order, they show headlines 1 to 6, but always be BAU brand, you know, 7 to 10 will be seasonal, 11 to 15 would be promo.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just making sure that you've got all those 15 filled in. Because what. One of the. One of the issues I've. I've had is that some asset groups only have eight headlines. Some have 12. So it's actually getting. When you know that it's in position one at 12, for instance. That it starts at that point and then that becomes the company standard. Then is that's the way it's being done. That will make things a lot easier, then what I can do is then I can start to be doing analysis on those asset tags to see what works and what doesn't. Because, you know, I mean, you. You've agreed before that the asset text isn't the best.
Them: Yeah. Y. Es.
Me: You know, it's all. It's. It's been driven by marketing, and they've not necessarily known why they're doing it. So if we can review that in January as well.
Them: Yes.
Me: And actually look at what we're putting out, but base it upon, you know, I can get some stats together on how, how, how. What's the click through rate on 135 years of experience? You know, that, that kind of headline, which might scan well for the powers that be, but if it doesn't actually attract a decent ctr, then what's the point in having it. You know, it's so that's. That's another job for January is to do. Is to do all that kind of stuff. I just have a proper spring clean.
Them: Yeah, exactly.
Me: You know, it just blitz it. You know, the, the, the site links leader need a good looking over as well, because I think a lot of them are just use account level site links, whereas we need to be looking at things like the bags category needs to have, you know, briefcases, travel bags, purses, wallets, as the site links because they're pertinent towards that asset group or towards that. That search campaign. So, yeah, there's. There's a. There's a bit to be done. Merry christmas.
Them: Yeah. And I think it's. I don't know if I've just not been privy to it because. I'm closer to detail now than I have been. But when we had the agency evolved, I don't know what the thought process was in terms of the copy, but whether it was over box filling, boxed like filling exercise, or whether it was. Really thinking about how these messages read the end user searching and seeing. Yeah.
Me: In and out. That's the thing. It's in. In an ad, rather than just how it reads.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I, I've put some of these through through just bog stand analysis on what makes a good headline and it'll just rip some of them to pieces because they're just too generic, you know, they're written by an 18 year old who just started in marketing and that's not what we need. We need to be compelling. They need to have a high ctr, but we've got shitloads of data on it now.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And we've got loads of data on it, particularly to specific countries. You know, because what might work in the UK doesn't necessarily work well in the, in the. In the US or in Europe. You know, and I hate to say it, but things like the European ones, we can just whack them through a translator and it'll come up with some decent stuff.
Them: For some of these headlines. I've just, I've used chat GBT to say, what is the. You know, translate this from English to French and then I use Deepel to then just double check. Yeah, because I'm not always 100% with any translator. So I used within chat GBT and then verify debug or depot and then use chat GPT because obviously with chat GPT I can then get the. Is this a formal way of saying it? Here's a less formal way. Here's a way luxury brands say it. Because obviously, it's like with every language, it's five ways to say the same thing.
Me: There is. And it's funny you say five because I use five different styles when I'm doing headlines. If I had 15 headlines, I'd split them up to five different types. So you have a. You have a brand one.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You have a technical one. You have a call to action. You have a quirky one. Was that 4 or 5? But there's. There's five. But there's five different types. So. So, you know, you. Then you mix in and matching maybe a brand with a call to action. Because a lot of the time these, these things, like Shop now is just piss poor, isn't it? You know, there's no thought gone into that at all. But it's just, you know. But a CTA can be. Can be. Come look at our range of briefcases. That's a call to action. It's telling someone what to do. So there is that. That mix and match stuff. And again.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I. I've got. I've got stuff written that we can. We can use to generate that kind of thing. And even if I say to you, well, look for this particular asset group, I've got these options. You pick whichever ones you want. These, these are the ones have been auto generated. By the, by the AI. And when I say auto generated, it looks at the landing page, it looks the tone of voice of the website, and it looks at what's previously happened on there and what's worked and what hasn't and comes up with, with a list of 15 headlines and 15 descriptions. So I can give you those.
Them: Yeah.
Me: For each one of the asset groups. And you can, you can say, well, okay, well, I like that one. I like that fits in with the brown. That doesn't fit in with the brand. So it's more of, you know, it's, it's a picker rather than you have to think about what's from scratch. What you. What you're going to be doing. So that's a. That's another option for going forward as well.
Them: Yeah, and I think that's.
Me: You like chief copywriter.
Them: Yeah. I mean, I haven't used the marketing team now since. But certainly it's. Well, I mean, in a couple of weeks. I've been doing it since Lauren went. I haven't got there once. All I do is I tend to look at. I use the website as the first reference.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So if willing to Notebooks. What are we saying about notebooks there? That's generally quite a close guide to what I want to talk about. But then also I go around and have a look at other competitors and just kind of, you know, what, what call to action is today. Use what you know how. Talking about air categories as well. So people that are kind of in the same space as us.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Just to get an idea on kind of what else is out there. So, yeah, I haven't touched marketing at all with any of this, even for the sale.
Me: Good.
Them: I've taken a couple of bits that looked all right from last year. Looked at other luxury brands and then looked at our website. And just really go from there.
Me: Well, I'm pleased you've taken on board what I've said about it in the past, that you know, there's no point in flooding it with 20% off. I know that. I know, I know. It's 20% off. You don't need to tell me 15 times it's 20% off. And it is just. It is using that intelligence at Google to say much with the person that's coming along, and they seem to have looked all right, you know.
Them: Well, they also the one the ads I've seen. And maybe actually because Seb is very quick to if he sees. Any combination that he's like, he'll tell me. And he hasn't done anything for a couple of weeks now.
Me: Nice. Nice.
Them: But certainly the ones I've noticed have the ones I'm being shown read really well, because they're not like you say they're not. There's not 10 headlines with the promo in, there's three.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And I end up seeing one and on with a nice brand message afterwards.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So, yeah, I think we're in. A good place. I just need to. For this sale stuff, I just need to find out when we're going to get some imagery and then I'll whack that. I'll whack that in.
Me: The image. It's the images that being the real. The real issue. Are really.
Them: They're not that good anyway, to be honest. You know, the Black Friday was exactly the same as last year's Black Friday. Thought was a bit of a cop out.
Me: What I would ask on the on the sale ones is if you have three sale images. Like the black Friday ones. That we could just add to everything. You know, literally, just, just say, I've got highlighter. I could do it in ads editor. Highlight all the asset groups and say, add those assets to those. Those campaigns. And.
Them: So, like a generic.
Me: Just does it at top level.
Them: Yeah, it probably will be. Generic winter sale.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Messaging that will be applicable for everything.
Me: Because the problem with the 20% off ones is they were too small, the writing was too small. The Black Friday ones are really good. You know, because it is right in your face. It's telling you exactly what it's all about. But the, the, the, the more recent ones, the, the, the actual tax has been too narrow. And if you think normally, if you're like, if you're looking on a, on a, a mobile. You've got an image. It's. It's tiny. What you. What you're looking at. So if you've got an image of a. Of a product and then over the overlaying that with a text, you can't actually get the message at all. The main. The main message comes from the text.
Them: Now. Yeah. I mean. Some of them. I mean, actually, we got the same issue on. They've got, like, a weird handwriting font that they use at the minute.
Me: Yes.
Them: Which they use on email.
Me: Right.
Them: Assets. And I plan it. I can read it.
Me: No, it's too narrow.
Them: On a desktop.
Me: Yeah. It looks like a pencil line almost, doesn't it? Or a pen line. It's that thin.
Them: Yeah. So I said to someone else, can you, like, what does that say? And even though you know what it says, Because you briefed it in. It's like, no, I can't read it. It's like you're not going to be able to see this. Let me just see if I can. Let's see how.
Me: Okay?
Them: See that? Bottom? Bottom. The Christmas present with the handwriting.
Me: Jesus christ.
Them: I'm not expecting anybody to read it because I'm showing my phone. But like, that is not.
Me: It's not a message, though, is it?
Them: No, but I have to squint to see it on my.
Me: I get the idea. It's just if it was bigger, it might actually be better.
Them: Yeah, it's a disconnect between the idea is fine, but the execution is not really thought about. So they think about the idea and they create this image, but they don't think about where it's going to be seen.
Me: And that's a great example that. Because most people don't design for mobile anyway, do they?
Them: No. Which. Is super sacking on a fence really shouldn't.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
Them: It.
Me: With that one. If it was. If it was the same font, but it was just one line of. Of text, it might actually work because it'd have to be bigger then wouldn't it occupy the same amount of space but just one line of text?
Them: Yeah, I mean, our fonts on there, but are tiny. I'm going to have to. Talk to about that. Don't know. Give anyone half a chance of reading anything.
Me: How would the. How the shop's done last week.
Them: I haven't seen yet, but they were struggling. Which is why I said we might haven't talked about last week. We could probably throw even if we had a limited budget for paid search. We'd have to be lifting up. Stores and perhaps three other channels as well.
Me: Right. Right.
Them: That's the big one at the minute.
Me: Right.
Them: But there's nothing even in stores you can do about it. And then really, you just go wait for people to come in?
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All the work's been done in three or four. Well, the 12 months prior to that, isn't it?
Them: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
Me: Anyway.
Them: Imagine. Yeah. But. No, I mean, otherwise. Yeah. Good. Pretty happy with last week, to be honest. I think overall, for at least for the website of the business. It was a good promo. Week. So now this week is like, you know, this is the sort of. Falls to the wall before everybody turns off. So we're supposed to have an email promo for the US Going today, but on Friday night, the method we were using broke, so we had to pause all of that. So coming up with another solution. Then. Yeah. It's going to be all on the uk, isn't it, from Wednesday onwards.
Me: It is. And if it carries on with the roas that it's on, I've not looked at the. The product distribution yet for the uk. To see what is selling, whether it is diaries or, you know, there's a. There's a good old mixture. I mean, it'd be nice if it was diaries. Because that might be more Christmas agnostic, though you're still going to get that after Christmas.
Them: Well, campaign wise, it's performing well.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's still holding a decent. Decent rallies, to be honest, given that, you know, we're talking everything. We're talking about everything else at the minute.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Do you see that in just in the Google Ads dashboard under products.
Me: What's that? The products that are selling.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yes, you can do yeah, yeah.
Them: Yeah. Even in the US Top clicked last week was a diary.
Me: Right.
Them: Writing paper. Diary card holder. Diary card holder. Diary. Diary. That's us. Anyway, so I was doing some work on that quick.
Me: Notebook, diary, writing paper, uk? No. Lots of diaries. Yeah.
Them: So I tend to. I quite like to flick between the product bit and the search terms and the insights and reports.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Like, just for a flavor of.
Me: Yeah, yeah.
Them: What's going on? Yeah. King's writing paper for the uk. Last seven days. Does it? Let me. See? Can you see the number of units or conversions? Let me just see.
Me: Yes, you can do. It's got conversions on the, on that table. You can also, when you, when you go on that product products tab, there's a bit at the top that says products, categories, brands, product types and custom labels. You can go to product types on there and it breaks it down. And look, sorry, groups it a little bit more, so.
Them: Yeah, just elevate. Oh, yeah. Diaries and books.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Eight, 42.
Me: Yeah. So all notebooks last seven days, 67 diaries, 100 conversions. So you ever want just a little bit of a flavor of what's going on, you can. You can look in.
Them: So product wise, I've got.
Me: The.
Them: 11 conversions on the first tab products. Got 11 conversions for the king writing paper.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: All right, hang on. So. The boss wafer notebook and Panama 14 conversions smise and 26 diary. 12. It's interesting that. The top. 1, 2, 3. Four. Four are top five. Adaris.
Me: Three. You. Top one's a notebook, isn't it?
Them: Oh, yeah, notebook. Yeah, notebook, Diary, paper. And then I've got an out of stock one. It's not eligible.
Me: Yeah.
Them: See, I'm going to steal some of that insight as well. That's quite interesting.
Me: I could do you a quick bit of analysis if you want, mate, I'm here if you. I've got all this stuff in loaded up into my database. Have you ever want any analysis doing, just let me know.
Them: Yeah, I only tend to in these. In on these calls is when I try and attend to kind of find stuff because you end up speaking out loud and then looking at something else.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Then. So we got. That's really interesting. Notebook, diary. That's quite cool. I'm going to. Let's see how I can. And that's all campaigns as well. Actually, that's quite interesting. So that's probably the best way to look at it. Just look at the top. Top.
Me: Y. Es.
Them: Awesome.
Me: So you've got, say, you've got that. The product types, or, you know, if you wanted something a bit more granular. I mean, you could do all sorts of stuff. You know, just, you know, what's the. What's the. The. The best color? But bear in mind. It's quite interesting looking at these things. And that what you're looking at in the products screen is not what people have bought. That's what they've clicked on.
Them: Well, but if I had the. If I look at conversions. Would that be true to what they've bought?
Me: No. No, that's how many sales they were after. Someone clicked on an advert with that in it. So what I was going to say is you do tend to find sometimes that you'll find red products. Are the most clicked on just because they're more visible, they catch your eye on the screen. But once you get through to that page, if you click on that Top Boss wafer notebook, you might find that it's not actually the Navy one that sells, it's another one.
Them: Right, so the conversions. There were 14 conversions where the first click was on the smise and boss notebook.
Me: Correct. Yeah.
Them: That's not 14. Yeah, that's not 14 sales at that point up. That's 14 sales that started. There.
Me: Correct. They might not sold any notebooks at all. There might be something on there that's a sell up that's more attractive than that.
Them: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.
Me: So bear that in mind a little bit, you know, when you, when you're reporting it. And this is why I want to get the email, Beth, about the Axis 5 to Salesforce.
Them: Yes.
Me: Not heard back from. If he's. If you see, could you ask her to have a quick look at it? I just need more information from her, just to be able to link it in. But then I can. I can look at things. What has sold.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Against what's been advertised. And what is there an opportunity in there where you'd sell in lots of things? On the website. But I'm not really not. The ads aren't firing off for it. So there's a, there's a, you know, there's a bit of a gap analysis to be, to be done is to how we can improve that. Because I can manually promote a product, you know, I can give it a bit more air. You know the, if you, if you scan over to the right hand side in that. I don't need the, the columns, but there's a, there's a custom label in there, Custom Label 3, which tells you which segment it's in. Whether it's in heroes, villains, psychics or zombies. So that tells you that the level in which it's been promoted.
Them: Okay. Yeah, that'll be interesting. Also from a. From a. Category perspective that that's probably the next piece that I need to feedback in is category performance for the whole business. So. And see what kind of what's either doing well that we can push more or what's kind of really underforming that we either need to ignore or is there an opportunity for it as well.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. My suspicion, you look at the leather goods. I mean, I'm just scrolling down the screen now. I've not come across one yet. Oh, glasses case. Oh, there is a. You know, there's a. There are a few briefcases. But they are very much. A Christmas product. You know, they're a gifting thing.
Them: Yes.
Me: You know, it's almost like you need to segment out the year, isn't it? You know, you got diaries there, you've got your evergreen, your writing papers and your notebooks and so on, and then you've got your diaries, sort of like December, January, February, maybe. I don't know. Go to February or not. But then the briefcases are really is just like a Christmassy thing, isn't it? You know, at a time you got to look at the roas that you're going to get out of it and is it really worth pushing the rest of the year? Do you just wind it up at Christmas.
Them: Yes.
Me: You know, you could say for fortune, just redirecting budget. I mean, that's. It's been a revelation for me. I've literally just been shuffling money around. Between countries, then in between the individual campaigns as well, just to. To get the best roas out of it. It's not been a sort of like carte blanche kind of idea, but that there must be some seasonality and all that as well.
Them: Oh, 100%. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just finding the time in. In between, isn't it?
Me: Yeah.
Them: To actually kind of do the. Do the it and then come up with the actions. That's the bit that always gets. It's kind of the first thing that gets put to the side, isn't it, I think.
Me: Yeah. We have a new friend now, though, don't we? I'm calling him Clara now. He's not Claude anymore. He's cl.
Them: Yeah, that's true. Team of three.
Me: Apping. So to be honest, I'm a lot more optimistic, pessimistic, more optimistic now about. Getting to this target. I know. I mean, I can't do anything about anything else in the business, you know, but the numbers have been put in front of us, so let's go for it. And it's. It's not looking too bad.
Them: Well, I mean, yeah, this is it, because this channel's. I mean, I was looking at the numbers now. I was doing a report as we're talking, and even Europe one at the minute. Spend was flat on the year. But. Traffic plus 39 sales. Plus 189 or paid. So four paid journals.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. There's an opportunity. There is in is immense, absolutely immense.
Them: But this is what I want to build on for next year. Is Europe and rest of the world. Because the amount of effort to try and move the needle in the UK and US is quite difficult. We're obviously try and do that, but. As I say, there's quite a lot of. Obvious things that could be done in Europe and the rest of the world. That will get quite a big return. For a good, you know. For a good rise in most of it.
Me: Let me just show you these. This is just the last three days. I mean, that is just fabulous. Before. Well, the fabulous one was the UK because that's the one with the, the biggest spend. But, you know, you look at the US and Europe, And they're all limited by budget. I think one of the reasons the UK's done so well is because they've moved money out of the UK and put it into Europe. And it's just got to work a bit harder now. What's going to happen when Europe stops on the. On the night of the 16th? I don't know. What's going to happen with the UK when I reallocate that budget? I don't know. But I'm hoping it's got enough momentum then, and it's close enough to Christmas. That it will still perform the way it's performing now.
Them: Yeah, that'll be the interesting one, won't it? Is that UK gets all the juice for that last. That last? You know, four. Four days or so.
Me: Eighteenth to the 24th, basically. So it was 17 to 24th. And I'm not going to pull it back on the 22nd either. It'll give it too much of a wobble if I do that. You know you've got last orders on the 22nd. I'm just going to leave the budget exactly as it is.
Them: That is it because also the search will determine if the amount of searches will determine on the spend as well.
Me: Demand. Yes. Down to demand. Yeah.
Them: So.
Me: Definitely.
Them: I'd expect spend to drop down quite significantly anyway, just even just with the lack of searches that are going to.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: See. So, yeah, because I think. I don't want to happen is I. I do want to. Obviously uk, US and EU is easier because. Even wrestle a while because there's more time. Between.
Me: Yes.
Them: Especially because EU goes live later as well. You doesn't even go live on the 24th.
Me: Oh, does it not?
Them: Tuesday, the 6th of January.
Me: Oh, sorry. You got it on there? Yes, you have.
Them: So us and rest in a while have got a nice break where we can kind of move, spend down, rearlocate, and then slowly build it up for the 24th. UK can be a bit lights off. On the 21st, lights back on 24th if we're not careful. I think it happened last year. They pretty much stopped everything. And then it took best part of a week to get everything back up and running again.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So, yes, it's just managing that curve. Isn't it?
Me: I. Think I did something on that. Because I just need to put these difference. Last order dates. On. That'll skew it. December, okay? So last year, 2024 phase phases. So last order week ROAS703, that was 15th to 22nd. The Christmas lull 23rd to the 25th, 945. Because your competition is going to just drop out.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Boxing day. 1500%. And then post boxing day. The 27th and 31st is 921. Very strong period. Very, very strong period. It's so patronizing. This. Key insight. Christmas lull was not a lull in 2024. Terribly sorry. Let me just ping this over to you. Well, we're pretty much halfway pointed. 88k spent 1st to 13th. And what? We've got 83 left.
Them: That'd be helpful for that. Last push into sale as well.
Me: Well, this is. This was. The thing with P8 was not to. We'd spent too much money at the beginning of P8.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It should have been held back until we got to a point where. Where historically the conversion rate increased. And then, and then went for it, then to just keep the thing ticking over and then, then throw the money in at the, at the time when it's going to, it's going to convert. So hopefully with P9, it will be. It will be able to do that.
Them: Well, I mean, given we're halfway through that's where we're at, then it kind of suggests as much.
Me: I'm recording this. And then boxing day. Expecting between 1200, 1500 roas for this year. Four times higher than normal. It's crazy, isn't it? People spending so much money just on a very, very short space of time.
Them: Y. Eah. Well, it's not cheap. Not too Gary. Is. It.
Me: No, no. But this is the. So this is the plan for the budget. This will. This is going to change a little bit because of those. I think I put the 18th for last order date for the U.S. but that's the, that's the way the budget is going to roll.
Them: Okay?
Me: Whack it up on the 26th. That'd be nice. 135 grand on one day. And then I'm away on the 27th.
Them: Yeah, I can't imagine. There'd be really anything. To.
Me: Well, these P10 to do, isn't. There.
Them: Yeah, but that would come in the new year anyway, because a lot of people are off.
Me: But it's whether we leave the budgets as they are. Running into that. I mean, I'm back at about the 4th or something. I'm taking my computer with me. I'm not. I won't be off grid.
Them: What's the drop in? So we go from 1-7-1963 to 1-41-double-08.
Me: So you have to compare.
Them: So you click yes, you could deal or you're chasing your tower a bit in the last. It's a five week period.
Me: Yeah. I'll have a look at what the conversion rates were like last year. First two weeks in January. The whole of January. They split it out. Where are these budgets now going forward? Where do you keep them?
Them: In that digital marketing. Master. So.
Me: Is that you shared that with me, haven't you?
Them: Yeah. We should.
Me: Emailed that video. There. We go. Patience, patience. Get. Into that. It's a good neck exercise. This is like this all the time. I can't get a wider screen. Just get a crick him in there. So what? Ppc costs. Is that what I'm looking at? That's cost, isn't? It. All right. Paid. Paid search. P10. 143471. And for that. What's the demand figure on there? Google Ads demand revenue target, and we've got a demand figure. Roas and Google Ad through us. What is that? What does that roas relate to the 4.2?
Them: No, I. Ignore that. Ignore. Ignore this tab.
Me: Okay?
Them: See. I'll give you the. The budget and then I'll need to do. I'll give you the demand. Later. Today. If you see. Do you see the green tab that says Digital Marketing?
Me: Yeah.
Them: You click on that one? And then look at row 22. I've highlighted it in green.
Me: Got you.
Them: That's the Google spends. So one form.
Me: 140. Yeah.
Them: Yeah, that's the Google spend. And what I'll do is I'll go in my budget sheets and all of the paid search revenue that was in the budget. Plus the additional revenue, and then I'll give you that number.
Me: Lovely.
Them: As well.
Me: Okay?
Them: But yeah, the key one is 141.
Me: 29th December. 1st February. Okay.
Them: Yeah. And then I've got the activity on row 15 as well, so you can see. What's going on?
Me: Nice. I like that. Yeah.
Them: But yes, in any bit that's missing in here is it doesn't break down. I've got the weekly demand for the whole web channel and row seven. But I haven't got an issue. What? The paid search demand is paid search demand budget is. So I'll pick that out.
Me: Right.
Them: And send it over. Or I'll put it on that. I'll update that page search tab, perhaps just to have the page search. Specifics in it.
Me: Okay?
Them: But. Cool, all right. Oh, yeah. No, she's quickly saying the compet search competitor AI campaign 600 pounds spent, 4.2k conversion value.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So if you please with that.
Me: Me. Let's see.
Them: Says almost a 7 return on return on ice wind.
Me: I certainly wouldn't run that outside. Peak.
Them: No, hopefully just get bored of it. Once they stop targeting us. But for now,
Me: I mean, It's a. It's 30 quid. You could spend three times as much as that.
Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's a vanity project for him, so we'll just leave it as is.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'm looking. Last seven days, I'm seeing nine. 49, 41. Roas. For the uk.
Them: N. Ice.
Me: 180 quid. 1700 pounds in revenue.
Them: That's this last week, then that it's really picked up.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Cool.
Me: The week before was shit for the UK. It really was poor. It was under 400%. And it's just been in this last week. I. I don't know whether it's a sale that's done it. Proximity to Christmas. You know, it's like the. It's like the. You know, the rules of. Of experimentation don't change more than one thing at a time. But at the end of the day, the sale's gone on and it's got closer to Christmas. So it's one of those that's made the difference.
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: And who cares? You know, if it's done it, it's done it.
Them: No. Well, quite. Yeah. Not really bothered. Where or why, but. Yeah, certainly on the year, it's doing pretty well.
Me: Would last seven days. It's. It would 9% down on roas. But if you look at Roas by time. Rather than the 30 day cookie. It's. It's well up. It's 22% up. So it's like. It's like the revenue figure for pH. We're reporting on it. Go. Yeah, it didn't actually make it, and we've pretty much done it. It's. It's hit the. It's hit the target. But with an extra 12 gram to spend.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So it's whether we can get this, pull this round, I don't know. We'll see.
Them: Could be a good Christmas after. All.
Me: Goodbye. Yes.
Them: Right. I've got to shoot to another meeting. So, yes, I think the only two bits I need to get over to you is I'll give Beth a nudge. And then. I will just confirm the demand budget targets.
Me: Wonderful. Thank you. Very much.
Them: Note. Cool. All right, switching.
Me: Catch you later.
