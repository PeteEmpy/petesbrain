- 'Them: Yeah, sure. Good morning.'
- 'Me: Hi, marine.'
- 'Them: Can you hear me?'
- 'Me: Yes, I can. Yes, I can.'
- 'Them: How are you?'
- 'Me: I''m very well, thank you. You.'
- 'Them: I''m doing good. It''s nice to connect with you.'
- 'Me: Finally.'
- 'Them: Yes, I''m happy I was able to get your time. I know it''s quite busy, so
  thank you for taking the time to hop on the call.'
- 'Me: No problem. I apologize. I''ve not been able to. I''ve not been that receptive.
  I''m creating a huge AI system at the moment, and it''s just taking up all my time.'
- 'Them: You''re trying to do what?'
- 'Me: I''m creating a big AI system to help run the business, so it''s taking up
  a lot of time.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Should we? Do. Yeah. Excuse me. No, we''re louis. Yeah, I know. You
  have been saying some of these application is actually, I have to have you on the
  call because some of the questions I have to ask. And just for me to kind of understand
  like a priorities. But the rest, if there is anything, I''m happy to follow up during
  that.'
- 'Me: Cool. No problem at all.'
- 'Them: It''s okay, we start recording. So you said you want to do the call for 15
  minutes. I didn''t understand if you want shorter or like 30 minutes.'
- 'Me: I know the call is 20 minutes. That''s fine. We can do that today. Not a problem.'
- 'Them: Okay, Sounds good. Yeah, I still am looking after the tree, my door and then
  have added is the crowd control.'
- 'Me: Yep. Yep.'
- 'Them: So can you kind of quickly walk me through? You can start maybe with the
  crowd control. I did look at the website, what they do. I think that as we go to
  the end of the year and earlier, it''s kind of a good time for them because retailers
  Black Friday or like concert the most businesses or like, they need those type of
  projects. So can you kind of walk me through?'
- 'Me: Okay? Most. Businesses. Yeah, it''s funny. It''s more of a B to B business.
  You or I would not need a crowd control barrier, really, would we? It''s a strange
  life we live in if we did need one.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. I''ll look into them.'
- 'Me: So it''s been B to B. It''s about customer acquisition. We''ve got a target
  ROAS of about. I''d like to hit 300% on it if we can. But the client looks at Roas
  in terms of what is the total revenue for the business. Divided by the Google Ad
  spend, because that''s the only marketing that they do is through Google Ads. So,
  yeah, there''s been a few challenges with it. One of them recently is that the tracking
  wasn''t working correctly.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I realize. Thank you very much. I apologize.'
- 'Me: In october. So we''re missing some. We were missing some of the traffic and
  missing some of the conversions. He did work well during October. We weren''t actually
  seeing all of the conversions that''s now been fixed.'
- 'Them: Which is.'
- 'Me: And I''ve implemented a new conversion tracking system on there. And I think
  I just need to check, actually, that we are actually getting enhanced conversions
  coming through. Right. Still saying that cart data needs attention. Apparently with
  WooCommerce, which is with a platform that they''re using, there has been an issue
  recently where it''s been a penny ga underscore product id so it''s not been matching
  up with The Merchant Center SKUs. I think I''ve resolved that now, but time will
  tell whether that''s the case or not. So that''s a new development. So any discrepancies
  there are in the conversion tracking, that''s the reason for it.'
- 'Them: I see. Oh, wow. But now can we say that it''s fixed? Are we still waiting
  to confirm if it''s.'
- 'Me: It is fixed. I''m just waiting to confirm that in terms of the numbers. This
  could be quite a lead time on the products for this with it being B to B. But I
  know from looking at the stats in the admin system that it''s not impacted sales,
  overall sales, but obviously it will be affecting the algorithm. The algorithm would
  have been hit during that period of time, so it may be pulling back slightly on
  things, which is something I need to keep track of.'
- 'Them: Yeah, absolutely. So for the in terms of the campaign structure for B2B would
  usually tend to see is when they sell like bundles so that they sell like more quantity,
  they can make more. But usually it can be a bit challenging. So it does involve
  like having at least trying to have like PMaxes focusing on the highest return type
  of product. What is the kind of structure we have in the account?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Absolutely. In terms. Of the campaign struct. Ure. Yes. So I use product
  hero for the structure of the account. The pmax campaigns. Well, there''s two pbmax
  campaigns. One is the heroes and sidekicks. Which is their best target, their best
  Roas products. There is a villains, which is the ones that are costing them money.
  And then I have a zombies shopping campaign which is products which have no conversions.
  So that''s assessed on a nightly basis as to whether it moves between those different
  segments.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. I think that''s ideal. And I looked at how were the placement
  for pmax.'
- 'Me: Well, placements. In what respect?'
- 'Them: Okay, because one of the things I wanted to share with you was the kind of
  automatic limiting the. The placement. The. The placement of low value. But we.
  That''s why I wanted to get you on the call. We have to make sure that. Is this,
  like an account where we''re kind of concerned of some of. The placement.'
- 'Me: Yep. Okay?'
- 'Them: So if we look at the past three months, would you say that there have been
  like any low quality placement? On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate to the
  placement from.'
- 'Me: No idea. I don''t look at placements, so I''m curious to know how we''ll do
  that.'
- 'Them: How you look at placements.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Let me share my screen. Because this can definitely help be more investment
  efficient. Because some of the impressions and clicks. So let''s look at the last
  maybe three months. Yeah. So we can go to, let''s just say this BMAX campaign.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: And then you go to report editor. And then. I''m sure it''s okay. Here.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Can you see it? Profiles, Max.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: And then we click here. Let''s say. So. I feel like this is really good,
  actually. Most of them are, like, showing up on Google own operated, which is nice.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Turned out like this third party and yahoo. I think this is okay, right?
  I mean, it is.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: A good platform.'
- 'Me: Wait. Good for remarking. Yeah, definitely.'
- 'Them: And then ebay is good. Daily Mail this. Personally, I think this is also
  good because I can use people go to this, right?'
- 'Me: Well, I don''t know there''s real news, but they do go to it for news.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And then MCN looks like there''s a lot of news type of platform. Like
  this is what I''m saying. So I will say like for instance, on these pmax, this is
  personally okay.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Them: Because like the rest are just small. Let''s see. Wait, how many pmax do
  we have? Is this the Phoenix campaign? Okay, this is the other one. So looks like
  for this one though, it''s showing for mobile app.'
- 'Me: I can''t say it on your screen. Apart from msm. There we go.'
- 'Them: Can you see my screen?'
- 'Me: I can see app store. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So this is what I''m asking. Is this something that. Is this kind of. Because
  on this PMX campaign, looks like there''s a lot of mobile app.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah. And it''s quite a lot of impressions. So this is where I''ll be basically,
  for the beta, the engineering team. Asks, like, how can we rate this? And then what
  are the type of placement that we don''t want? And we will kind of share this. And
  then what they do is try to actually removing them like an automatically instead
  of us doing it like nine years ago. So manually you can try, but it has take so
  much. Time. So let me show you because not that many people do it actually, but
  I always recommend it. This might be helpful for your other accounts, the way you
  can do it manually. For instance, you saw that there are so many mobile apps on
  this pmax Shopping the Villains campaign and you don''t want to be showing up on
  those at least you don''t want to pay any clicks that might come from those. What
  you would do is you will go to right?'
- 'Me: All right. I can''t do that manually, then.'
- 'Them: Okay? So you will go to tools and content, suitability. And then you see
  where he says exclude placement here.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And here you will just copy paste the web page of those placement that you
  don''t like and you put them here. And then you click save.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Obviously, this is really manual and you can take more time. But what I say
  is that still do this as a best practice every three months to just do it even on
  three my door. But I think as the B2B, your biggest PMAX is actually showing good
  places. That''s good progress. Only on some of the campaigns, it''s not that. Well,
  and then what you would do, this is how you do it manually, but for the VDA, they
  will do it automatically, but they still recommend if you want to do it manually,
  you can still do it. For me, there''s like really for people, like seeing not so
  great placement. And then the engineering team will do it automatically. And then
  bi weekly they might send like a quick survey. They will send a quick server. Like,
  how is a performance so far? Just a quick, short survey. But basically, this is
  what I wanted to share with you, at least for this account. And then don''t worry.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Is this something you would like to do, or you want to do it manually? Because.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ll give it a go manually, because at the end of the day, it sounds
  like a lot of to and throwing. To do it. I mean, I''m looking at. I''m looking at
  the campaign, the placements for Mo. Can I just share my screen, really, for a sec?'
- 'Them: Noteworth. Y overview. Absolutely. But. Yeah, go ahead.'
- 'Me: So I''ve just. I''ve just run this for crowd control. Is that the one? Where
  are we?'
- 'Them: I really like the last thing in your screen, by the way.'
- 'Me: There we go. That''s the one.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So I''m looking at this site wide and I can see that happy Color by numbers
  game impressions 27,502.'
- 'Them: I do like to end that word.'
- 'Me: Out of all of them. So that is a crazy amount of.'
- 'Them: Addition. Al. You would copy paste that in the next school day.'
- 'Me: So copy and paste that.'
- 'Them: So you click on it as if you''re going to that web page. Take the landing
  page of that. And then go back to go to this is why go to Content suitability, go
  all the way down excluded placement and then click Enter and then copy that. Prior.
  Ities. No. Go back. Do that again. I don''t think we saved it. Can you click Add
  placement?'
- 'Me: Ah, there we go. Right.'
- 'Them: And then, yeah. That''s how you would do it.'
- 'Me: Okay? Well, that''s good. I mean, that was a. That was a huge number coming
  through from that. That place.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So it''s going to save so much. Doesn''t make sense. Those impressions
  can go through another web page that it does help over time. It''s not perfect,
  but it does help.'
- 'Me: So I presume I can''t get any other information apart from impressions on that,
  then?'
- 'Them: No, unfortunately, that''s why I say. That''s why I say it''s so important
  to kind of remove them, because for me,'
- 'Me: Okay? Y.'
- 'Them: Not so great. Okay, sounds good.'
- 'Me: Eah.'
- 'Them: For them. When I was looking at terms like opportunity for them. It is still
  B2B but related to businesses that would need those type of products at the end
  of the year, like early year. So what is kind of the plan in terms of as we go to
  the end of now today, what was the revenue goal?'
- 'Me: Well. I think crowd control will die off quicker than Treating My Door. Treating
  My Door is a gifting site. So they will run up to. Yeah, in the same sort of way
  as any other. Any other ecommerce business. They will run up to about 20 December
  peak at black Friday and probably the week or two before Christmas. So it''s just
  case. Keep an eye on it. I know it''s going to peak him a little bit earlier this
  year. That''s what the numbers are saying. I''ve looked at their conversion rate
  for last year and trying to track it that way. And ensure there''s sufficient budget
  there and potentially drop target row as near at the time so we can maximize the
  potential for it.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I think when I was looking at it, For? Let me see the tree. My door.
  Just to. Give you maybe some numbers in terms of like, I think there is definitely
  for I say AMX is actually working. It''s bringing. It has been working.'
- 'Me: Yes. It is.'
- 'Them: Sorry.'
- 'Me: I''m pleased with it. I''m pleased with AI max, I think.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I think you started it for way longer. Right? I think we had discussed
  it. Yeah. And I''m happy that that''s actually been driving conversion. So I think
  for them. Let me look at last month. The only other thing I wanted to mention was.
  Of course. Again, the. These always be challenging for them, for roas. Right. Because
  they have such a small priority right now.'
- 'Me: Conversion numbers are. Are low. Yes, definitely. And it''s not helped with
  the last 30 days and being even lower.'
- 'Them: Y. Ep. So let me share my screen here. Can you see my screen?'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: This one. Can you see it? So I''m only looking at doys is showing. So let''s
  look at the last year.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: From the 12 and 12 to 24. I''m trying to look at it. So I think for them.
  As you can see. Yeah. Absolutely.'
- 'Me: This is for Treaty to my door, is it? Okay?'
- 'Them: So if we try to look at them.'
- 'Me: First week in December. Quite a big moment.'
- 'Them: They. ''re starting? I would say starting, yes. First week of December and
  then still starting this 22nd. Starting the 22nd. This is looking at the conversion,
  so the ROAS and the conversion rate. So we can see that from 22nd the ROAS start
  to improve and the return and the conversion rate is quite high.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Y.'
- 'Them: But especially for December, it''s, like, really grainy. So the greener it
  is, it means that. And you can see the conversion rate is actually consistent to
  6 to 9, where before it was, like, around 2. So for this, this is where I will say,'
- 'Me: Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: We can see that ROAS is going to build up. So in the conversion rate is really
  high. So for them, honestly, I will challenge to kind of make sure they''re not
  limiting too much the return on investment on certain campaigns.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Because when I try to look at the search campaigns here, And even on pmax,
  at least under search. Oh, pmax is good for the rank, but if we look at research
  campaign overall. Like the data structure due to rank is quite high. And it''s not
  like the lack of investment. Well, except on this campaign. It''s more of, like,
  return on investment. I''m trying to think if the campaigns are too spread out.
  Are the campaigns, like, do they have, like, different goals? These search campaign.'
- 'Me: Yes, you do. I''m in the memorial. Plants are about people dying and leaving
  flowers on them. Plenty of plows in the garden, memory of them. So it''s not really,
  you know, it''s not going to be seasonal as such. The roses campaigns, there''s
  more roses in some of them. There are in winter because. Just because availability
  because of the weather. So their demands are very different.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Absolutely. Not. It''s. Pretty secure. Obviously.'
- 'Me: Which is why they''re split out the way in which they are. And then within
  the PMAX campaign, there''s a number of asset groups covering the different sorts
  of products that there are. So there is a splitting out. There''s no point in too
  much consolidation of them. And again, we''re treating my door campaign. They are
  split out in terms of their profitability.'
- 'Them: Sometime. S. But I think we''re sort of the most. Keyword. Something. Like?
  Well, vacation. Okay. You don''t read the lineup. Public search report. So I think
  you''ve done what we can do is that for the flowers that they know their seasonal,
  right? In December. These are available when we have that campaign. Let''s make
  sure the return investment is not too aggressive. And then we can leave the other
  search campaign. Because you can see, like, Roy just shared the Classia they had.
  Really good. So want to make sure that we don''t miss out on that revenue that might
  be. In for restricting roas. But doing it strategically is doing it on campaigns
  where it is seasonal for them.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Is that? Does that make sense, Peter?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: So I think once we go to end of November, that''s where I would just kind
  of return investment by like 20 or like 30%, if possible.'
- 'Me: Absolutely, yeah.'
- 'Them: And one thing we wanted to share is that I''ve actually seen good results
  and heard good results. I''ve actually heard good results on AI Max 4 brand.'
- 'Me: Yes, I have as well. I''ve just been looking at that for somebody else that
  it was quite extraordinary to actually see. But it was down to using brand inclusion
  as well as AI Max, which was most surprising.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So I think this is something you can leverage between my door.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: And then.'
- 'Me: Eah.'
- 'Them: Just to your point. You already know the best practice like you make sure
  you do. Run exclusion, please don''t forget it.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But is this something you do? Because when I''m looking over, even crowd
  control, these are the. It''s working really well. And for their brand specifically,
  people are still searching in a way that''s really different. We can really see
  it, even if it''s a specific brand. So with AI Max, it was still making sure that
  we are now missing out on those opportunities when they come up. And for us, we''re
  still safe because we''re adding the brand inclusion, like any search is going to
  be related to that brand. So for crowd control, even for Tree My Door, this is something
  I would highly recommend. But just don''t forget that brand inclusion.'
- 'Me: Yep. I''ve just done it for treating my do I just switch AI Max and on there
  and I''ll have a look at the brand for crowd control.'
- 'Them: Ok? Sounds good. One last thing. What do you say? Yeah, for crowd control.
  I know. We keep going back and forth for the two trying to look at the time and
  make sure we maximize it.'
- 'Me: That''s okay. Okay?'
- 'Them: Where is my screen? Ok, here is my screen. I wanted to share this with you
  because you know how you''re doing the campaigns, right?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So this is looking at this year, but we can look at the time range, maybe
  last year, I don''t know. But this is looking at how each category is kind of performing.
  So in terms of what we''re spending versus what we''re getting, And I see that from
  January until now. Do you want to look at this from last year? Do you think it''ll
  be more impactful to see what was selling like last year? Were they running ads?'
- 'Me: I think the profile has changed between last year and this year.'
- 'Them: Ok, so we can keep at this. So they''re spending 9% under post op and floor
  standing. Yeah, but you''re getting, like, a conversion. Driving is, like, 14.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then for the wall mount, they''re driving, like, 27% more. And then for
  the sentient, less. So I think if we try to look at this, these are, like, selling
  more. And the wall mount.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Is this something that the client. Do we have? Do. These categories are the
  same, like performance, Max campaign. Or do they have enough?'
- 'Me: Well, I''m limited in what I can do because I can set up asset groups within
  there. I can''t split them out in separate campaigns though, and allocate different
  budget to it because there won''t be enough conversions in those PMAX campaigns
  if I do split it out.'
- 'Them: No, no, no. I don''t think we should split like another pmax. I wouldn''t
  recommend it. The important thing is actually integrating as much integration as
  possible.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: Where we can, but this is just to show what''s actually been selling. And
  then for you maybe to create another asset group or making sure on the campaign
  where we have those.'
- 'Me: Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: That campaign has enough investment, at least to make sure they''re not limited
  by investment. Because I think. The shopping villains is the one that needs more
  investment.'
- 'Me: No, because it''s not profitable.'
- 'Them: Oh, it''s not profitable.'
- 'Me: That''s why it''s called villains. It''s not profitable.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Interesting. The name. So interesting. This campaign is driving them
  3% ROAS last month.'
- 'Me: Yes, it is, because it''s limiting the budget. If it had a higher budget, then
  those products wouldn''t actually convert.'
- 'Them: Sorry.'
- 'Me: If it had a higher budget, those products wouldn''t convert. It would be as
  tight on where it was sending them out. So that''s why they sat in villains. When
  you say profitable, it''s profitable over 60 day, period. And those products aren''t
  likely to be profitable over that 60 day period, which is why they''re.'
- 'Them: Okay, I see. So what I will say then? Let me see. Some of the things I see
  that could also working is when it is definitely good to if you can to have asset
  group of categories.'
- 'Me: Yeah, definitely.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it does help to have the language too specific to those type of project.
  It does help. Like you drive better. And that''s about the general or could there
  specific product. So if you can have a language on asset group, it actually does
  help the performance of the campaign to other retailers.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: So I think I''ll stop here. This is what I wanted to share.'
- 'Me: Wonderful.'
- 'Them: With you.'
- 'Me: That''s been really useful. Thank you.'
- 'Them: Yeah, you''re welcome. And then for tree, my door. Yeah, we talked about
  lowering ROAS starting mid November, so maybe the 20th and then. So for them, I
  still see the unprofitable, but for both of them, as they''re planning to increase
  investment, given that there''s going to be high demand when we go. So, for instance,
  with my door, it looks like December is going to be huge for them that they''re
  planning to increase investment.'
- 'Me: If the roas goes up, then I''ll be increasing the investment. Yes.'
- 'Them: Okay? And then is that the same for crowd control?'
- 'Me: It''s the same for any client to have. I can''t just say I''m going to put
  more money into it and not get the investment back. So if the roas is there, then
  I''ll be spending the money.'
- 'Them: Okay, sounds good. And then, so for cross control, it''s the three return.
  But I think you also said they care about revenue. What is the revenue from crowd
  control that they want to get?'
- 'Me: As much as possible.'
- 'Them: Okay, but to say within roas of, like, three. Okay?'
- 'Me: I never have a client who says I need to hit a certain revenue.'
- 'Them: I think for an option. Sorry.'
- 'Me: I never have a client who says I want to hit a certain revenue.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It always has to be within a ROAS system. They still need to make profit.'
- 'Them: So I will. Yeah, absolutely. So I think what we can start now is like enable
  AMX. For Brian to do brand inclusion on the 20 lower was crowd control.'
- 'Me: That''s all done. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Ad asset group of, like, product categories. And then what we can do is I''m
  happy to have like a follow up call. Let''s see. So. I think so. Within two weeks?
  That works for me. On the 25th or the 26th, if that''s okay with you. And I think
  that''s a good timing because we''ll be going in December.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I could deal with it. Cook me not being that weak. I mean, that''s Black
  Friday week. I''m going to be all over the place.'
- 'Them: Okay? Okay. No worries at all. So you want to do early December, then?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Do you want to do the second?'
- 'Me: The second''s good. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Let me know. So I have a call attorney. Do you want to do same time? I know
  I feel like you like to meet earlier, but what time works for you, Peter?'
- 'Me: Yeah, 9:30 is good. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Nine thirty. Okay, sounds good. So some do the invite and then we''ll speaking
  two weeks. But if I see an opportunity, I will send you by email. And then you can
  go ahead and reply to me. I only ask that you reply so that I don''t keep bugging
  you with so many emails.'
- 'Me: That''s okay. That''s okay. Well, the problem I have is that. I have to do
  this a lot. I have 12 clients.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it needs to be. It needs to be laser guided when I have the calls as to
  something specific to the client, which is what you''ve done today. So I do appreciate
  them, but I only have so much time to do them in.'
- 'Them: Absolutely. It does make sense. It doesn''t make sense. So you can let me
  know like next time if you want to have integrated call. We added like account managers
  or how you want it so that this is really time efficient. And let me know that before
  the call if there are specific insights that you need just to make sure these are
  calls are valuable. So like, for instance, like today, do you think this was like
  something that was valuable? And then which would you like to see more? Okay, Sounds
  good. Peter. Yeah, Keep bringing the feedback on how we can make this better experience.'
- 'Me: Yes, it works. Yes, it was valuable. Yeah. Oh, absolutely.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good, Peter. Have a good rest of your day, okay?'
- 'Me: Thanks, maureen. Bye bye now.'
- 'Them: Bye.'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Them: Yeah, sure. Good morning.
- Me: Hi, marine.
- Them: Can you hear me?
- Me: Yes, I can. Yes, I can.
- Them: How are you?
- Me: I'm very well, thank you. You.
- Them: I'm doing good. It's nice to connect with you.
- Me: Finally.
- Them: Yes, I'm happy I was able to get your time. I know it's quite busy, so thank you for taking the time to hop on the call.
- Me: No problem. I apologize. I've not been able to. I've not been that receptive. I'm creating a huge AI system at the moment, and it's just taking up all my time.
- Them: You're trying to do what?
- Me: I'm creating a big AI system to help run the business, so it's taking up a lot of time.
- Them: Yeah. Should we? Do. Yeah. Excuse me. No, we're louis. Yeah, I know. You have been saying some of these application is actually, I have to have you on the call because some of the questions I have to ask. And just for me to kind of understand like a priorities. But the rest, if there is anything, I'm happy to follow up during that.
- Me: Cool. No problem at all.
- Them: It's okay, we start recording. So you said you want to do the call for 15 minutes. I didn't understand if you want shorter or like 30 minutes.
- Me: I know the call is 20 minutes. That's fine. We can do that today. Not a problem.
- Them: Okay, Sounds good. Yeah, I still am looking after the tree, my door and then have added is the crowd control.
- Me: Yep. Yep.
- Them: So can you kind of quickly walk me through? You can start maybe with the crowd control. I did look at the website, what they do. I think that as we go to the end of the year and earlier, it's kind of a good time for them because retailers Black Friday or like concert the most businesses or like, they need those type of projects. So can you kind of walk me through?
- Me: Okay? Most. Businesses. Yeah, it's funny. It's more of a B to B business. You or I would not need a crowd control barrier, really, would we? It's a strange life we live in if we did need one.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. I'll look into them.
- Me: So it's been B to B. It's about customer acquisition. We've got a target ROAS of about. I'd like to hit 300% on it if we can. But the client looks at Roas in terms of what is the total revenue for the business. Divided by the Google Ad spend, because that's the only marketing that they do is through Google Ads. So, yeah, there's been a few challenges with it. One of them recently is that the tracking wasn't working correctly.
- Them: Yeah. I realize. Thank you very much. I apologize.
- Me: In october. So we're missing some. We were missing some of the traffic and missing some of the conversions. He did work well during October. We weren't actually seeing all of the conversions that's now been fixed.
- Them: Which is.
- Me: And I've implemented a new conversion tracking system on there. And I think I just need to check, actually, that we are actually getting enhanced conversions coming through. Right. Still saying that cart data needs attention. Apparently with WooCommerce, which is with a platform that they're using, there has been an issue recently where it's been a penny ga underscore product id so it's not been matching up with The Merchant Center SKUs. I think I've resolved that now, but time will tell whether that's the case or not. So that's a new development. So any discrepancies there are in the conversion tracking, that's the reason for it.
- Them: I see. Oh, wow. But now can we say that it's fixed? Are we still waiting to confirm if it's.
- Me: It is fixed. I'm just waiting to confirm that in terms of the numbers. This could be quite a lead time on the products for this with it being B to B. But I know from looking at the stats in the admin system that it's not impacted sales, overall sales, but obviously it will be affecting the algorithm. The algorithm would have been hit during that period of time, so it may be pulling back slightly on things, which is something I need to keep track of.
- Them: Yeah, absolutely. So for the in terms of the campaign structure for B2B would usually tend to see is when they sell like bundles so that they sell like more quantity, they can make more. But usually it can be a bit challenging. So it does involve like having at least trying to have like PMaxes focusing on the highest return type of product. What is the kind of structure we have in the account?
- Me: Yeah. Absolutely. In terms. Of the campaign struct. Ure. Yes. So I use product hero for the structure of the account. The pmax campaigns. Well, there's two pbmax campaigns. One is the heroes and sidekicks. Which is their best target, their best Roas products. There is a villains, which is the ones that are costing them money. And then I have a zombies shopping campaign which is products which have no conversions. So that's assessed on a nightly basis as to whether it moves between those different segments.
- Them: Okay? Yeah. I think that's ideal. And I looked at how were the placement for pmax.
- Me: Well, placements. In what respect?
- Them: Okay, because one of the things I wanted to share with you was the kind of automatic limiting the. The placement. The. The placement of low value. But we. That's why I wanted to get you on the call. We have to make sure that. Is this, like an account where we're kind of concerned of some of. The placement.
- Me: Yep. Okay?
- Them: So if we look at the past three months, would you say that there have been like any low quality placement? On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate to the placement from.
- Me: No idea. I don't look at placements, so I'm curious to know how we'll do that.
- Them: How you look at placements.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Let me share my screen. Because this can definitely help be more investment efficient. Because some of the impressions and clicks. So let's look at the last maybe three months. Yeah. So we can go to, let's just say this BMAX campaign.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: And then you go to report editor. And then. I'm sure it's okay. Here.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Can you see it? Profiles, Max.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: And then we click here. Let's say. So. I feel like this is really good, actually. Most of them are, like, showing up on Google own operated, which is nice.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Turned out like this third party and yahoo. I think this is okay, right? I mean, it is.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: A good platform.
- Me: Wait. Good for remarking. Yeah, definitely.
- Them: And then ebay is good. Daily Mail this. Personally, I think this is also good because I can use people go to this, right?
- Me: Well, I don't know there's real news, but they do go to it for news.
- Them: Yeah. And then MCN looks like there's a lot of news type of platform. Like this is what I'm saying. So I will say like for instance, on these pmax, this is personally okay.
- Me: Yeah. Okay?
- Them: Because like the rest are just small. Let's see. Wait, how many pmax do we have? Is this the Phoenix campaign? Okay, this is the other one. So looks like for this one though, it's showing for mobile app.
- Me: I can't say it on your screen. Apart from msm. There we go.
- Them: Can you see my screen?
- Me: I can see app store. Yeah.
- Them: So this is what I'm asking. Is this something that. Is this kind of. Because on this PMX campaign, looks like there's a lot of mobile app.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Yeah. And it's quite a lot of impressions. So this is where I'll be basically, for the beta, the engineering team. Asks, like, how can we rate this? And then what are the type of placement that we don't want? And we will kind of share this. And then what they do is try to actually removing them like an automatically instead of us doing it like nine years ago. So manually you can try, but it has take so much. Time. So let me show you because not that many people do it actually, but I always recommend it. This might be helpful for your other accounts, the way you can do it manually. For instance, you saw that there are so many mobile apps on this pmax Shopping the Villains campaign and you don't want to be showing up on those at least you don't want to pay any clicks that might come from those. What you would do is you will go to right?
- Me: All right. I can't do that manually, then.
- Them: Okay? So you will go to tools and content, suitability. And then you see where he says exclude placement here.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And here you will just copy paste the web page of those placement that you don't like and you put them here. And then you click save.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Obviously, this is really manual and you can take more time. But what I say is that still do this as a best practice every three months to just do it even on three my door. But I think as the B2B, your biggest PMAX is actually showing good places. That's good progress. Only on some of the campaigns, it's not that. Well, and then what you would do, this is how you do it manually, but for the VDA, they will do it automatically, but they still recommend if you want to do it manually, you can still do it. For me, there's like really for people, like seeing not so great placement. And then the engineering team will do it automatically. And then bi weekly they might send like a quick survey. They will send a quick server. Like, how is a performance so far? Just a quick, short survey. But basically, this is what I wanted to share with you, at least for this account. And then don't worry.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Is this something you would like to do, or you want to do it manually? Because.
- Me: Well, I'll give it a go manually, because at the end of the day, it sounds like a lot of to and throwing. To do it. I mean, I'm looking at. I'm looking at the campaign, the placements for Mo. Can I just share my screen, really, for a sec?
- Them: Noteworth. Y overview. Absolutely. But. Yeah, go ahead.
- Me: So I've just. I've just run this for crowd control. Is that the one? Where are we?
- Them: I really like the last thing in your screen, by the way.
- Me: There we go. That's the one.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So I'm looking at this site wide and I can see that happy Color by numbers game impressions 27,502.
- Them: I do like to end that word.
- Me: Out of all of them. So that is a crazy amount of.
- Them: Addition. Al. You would copy paste that in the next school day.
- Me: So copy and paste that.
- Them: So you click on it as if you're going to that web page. Take the landing page of that. And then go back to go to this is why go to Content suitability, go all the way down excluded placement and then click Enter and then copy that. Prior. Ities. No. Go back. Do that again. I don't think we saved it. Can you click Add placement?
- Me: Ah, there we go. Right.
- Them: And then, yeah. That's how you would do it.
- Me: Okay? Well, that's good. I mean, that was a. That was a huge number coming through from that. That place.
- Them: Yeah. So it's going to save so much. Doesn't make sense. Those impressions can go through another web page that it does help over time. It's not perfect, but it does help.
- Me: So I presume I can't get any other information apart from impressions on that, then?
- Them: No, unfortunately, that's why I say. That's why I say it's so important to kind of remove them, because for me,
- Me: Okay? Y.
- Them: Not so great. Okay, sounds good.
- Me: Eah.
- Them: For them. When I was looking at terms like opportunity for them. It is still B2B but related to businesses that would need those type of products at the end of the year, like early year. So what is kind of the plan in terms of as we go to the end of now today, what was the revenue goal?
- Me: Well. I think crowd control will die off quicker than Treating My Door. Treating My Door is a gifting site. So they will run up to. Yeah, in the same sort of way as any other. Any other ecommerce business. They will run up to about 20 December peak at black Friday and probably the week or two before Christmas. So it's just case. Keep an eye on it. I know it's going to peak him a little bit earlier this year. That's what the numbers are saying. I've looked at their conversion rate for last year and trying to track it that way. And ensure there's sufficient budget there and potentially drop target row as near at the time so we can maximize the potential for it.
- Them: Yeah, I think when I was looking at it, For? Let me see the tree. My door. Just to. Give you maybe some numbers in terms of like, I think there is definitely for I say AMX is actually working. It's bringing. It has been working.
- Me: Yes. It is.
- Them: Sorry.
- Me: I'm pleased with it. I'm pleased with AI max, I think.
- Them: Yeah. I think you started it for way longer. Right? I think we had discussed it. Yeah. And I'm happy that that's actually been driving conversion. So I think for them. Let me look at last month. The only other thing I wanted to mention was. Of course. Again, the. These always be challenging for them, for roas. Right. Because they have such a small priority right now.
- Me: Conversion numbers are. Are low. Yes, definitely. And it's not helped with the last 30 days and being even lower.
- Them: Y. Ep. So let me share my screen here. Can you see my screen?
- Me: Yep.
- Them: This one. Can you see it? So I'm only looking at doys is showing. So let's look at the last year.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: From the 12 and 12 to 24. I'm trying to look at it. So I think for them. As you can see. Yeah. Absolutely.
- Me: This is for Treaty to my door, is it? Okay?
- Them: So if we try to look at them.
- Me: First week in December. Quite a big moment.
- Them: They. 're starting? I would say starting, yes. First week of December and then still starting this 22nd. Starting the 22nd. This is looking at the conversion, so the ROAS and the conversion rate. So we can see that from 22nd the ROAS start to improve and the return and the conversion rate is quite high.
- Me: Yeah. Y.
- Them: But especially for December, it's, like, really grainy. So the greener it is, it means that. And you can see the conversion rate is actually consistent to 6 to 9, where before it was, like, around 2. So for this, this is where I will say,
- Me: Eah. Yeah.
- Them: We can see that ROAS is going to build up. So in the conversion rate is really high. So for them, honestly, I will challenge to kind of make sure they're not limiting too much the return on investment on certain campaigns.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Because when I try to look at the search campaigns here, And even on pmax, at least under search. Oh, pmax is good for the rank, but if we look at research campaign overall. Like the data structure due to rank is quite high. And it's not like the lack of investment. Well, except on this campaign. It's more of, like, return on investment. I'm trying to think if the campaigns are too spread out. Are the campaigns, like, do they have, like, different goals? These search campaign.
- Me: Yes, you do. I'm in the memorial. Plants are about people dying and leaving flowers on them. Plenty of plows in the garden, memory of them. So it's not really, you know, it's not going to be seasonal as such. The roses campaigns, there's more roses in some of them. There are in winter because. Just because availability because of the weather. So their demands are very different.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Absolutely. Not. It's. Pretty secure. Obviously.
- Me: Which is why they're split out the way in which they are. And then within the PMAX campaign, there's a number of asset groups covering the different sorts of products that there are. So there is a splitting out. There's no point in too much consolidation of them. And again, we're treating my door campaign. They are split out in terms of their profitability.
- Them: Sometime. S. But I think we're sort of the most. Keyword. Something. Like? Well, vacation. Okay. You don't read the lineup. Public search report. So I think you've done what we can do is that for the flowers that they know their seasonal, right? In December. These are available when we have that campaign. Let's make sure the return investment is not too aggressive. And then we can leave the other search campaign. Because you can see, like, Roy just shared the Classia they had. Really good. So want to make sure that we don't miss out on that revenue that might be. In for restricting roas. But doing it strategically is doing it on campaigns where it is seasonal for them.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Is that? Does that make sense, Peter?
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Them: So I think once we go to end of November, that's where I would just kind of return investment by like 20 or like 30%, if possible.
- Me: Absolutely, yeah.
- Them: And one thing we wanted to share is that I've actually seen good results and heard good results. I've actually heard good results on AI Max 4 brand.
- Me: Yes, I have as well. I've just been looking at that for somebody else that it was quite extraordinary to actually see. But it was down to using brand inclusion as well as AI Max, which was most surprising.
- Them: Yeah. So I think this is something you can leverage between my door.
- Me: Y.
- Them: And then.
- Me: Eah.
- Them: Just to your point. You already know the best practice like you make sure you do. Run exclusion, please don't forget it.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But is this something you do? Because when I'm looking over, even crowd control, these are the. It's working really well. And for their brand specifically, people are still searching in a way that's really different. We can really see it, even if it's a specific brand. So with AI Max, it was still making sure that we are now missing out on those opportunities when they come up. And for us, we're still safe because we're adding the brand inclusion, like any search is going to be related to that brand. So for crowd control, even for Tree My Door, this is something I would highly recommend. But just don't forget that brand inclusion.
- Me: Yep. I've just done it for treating my do I just switch AI Max and on there and I'll have a look at the brand for crowd control.
- Them: Ok? Sounds good. One last thing. What do you say? Yeah, for crowd control. I know. We keep going back and forth for the two trying to look at the time and make sure we maximize it.
- Me: That's okay. Okay?
- Them: Where is my screen? Ok, here is my screen. I wanted to share this with you because you know how you're doing the campaigns, right?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So this is looking at this year, but we can look at the time range, maybe last year, I don't know. But this is looking at how each category is kind of performing. So in terms of what we're spending versus what we're getting, And I see that from January until now. Do you want to look at this from last year? Do you think it'll be more impactful to see what was selling like last year? Were they running ads?
- Me: I think the profile has changed between last year and this year.
- Them: Ok, so we can keep at this. So they're spending 9% under post op and floor standing. Yeah, but you're getting, like, a conversion. Driving is, like, 14.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And then for the wall mount, they're driving, like, 27% more. And then for the sentient, less. So I think if we try to look at this, these are, like, selling more. And the wall mount.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Is this something that the client. Do we have? Do. These categories are the same, like performance, Max campaign. Or do they have enough?
- Me: Well, I'm limited in what I can do because I can set up asset groups within there. I can't split them out in separate campaigns though, and allocate different budget to it because there won't be enough conversions in those PMAX campaigns if I do split it out.
- Them: No, no, no. I don't think we should split like another pmax. I wouldn't recommend it. The important thing is actually integrating as much integration as possible.
- Me: Y.
- Them: Where we can, but this is just to show what's actually been selling. And then for you maybe to create another asset group or making sure on the campaign where we have those.
- Me: Eah. Yeah.
- Them: That campaign has enough investment, at least to make sure they're not limited by investment. Because I think. The shopping villains is the one that needs more investment.
- Me: No, because it's not profitable.
- Them: Oh, it's not profitable.
- Me: That's why it's called villains. It's not profitable.
- Them: Yeah. Interesting. The name. So interesting. This campaign is driving them 3% ROAS last month.
- Me: Yes, it is, because it's limiting the budget. If it had a higher budget, then those products wouldn't actually convert.
- Them: Sorry.
- Me: If it had a higher budget, those products wouldn't convert. It would be as tight on where it was sending them out. So that's why they sat in villains. When you say profitable, it's profitable over 60 day, period. And those products aren't likely to be profitable over that 60 day period, which is why they're.
- Them: Okay, I see. So what I will say then? Let me see. Some of the things I see that could also working is when it is definitely good to if you can to have asset group of categories.
- Me: Yeah, definitely.
- Them: Yeah, it does help to have the language too specific to those type of project. It does help. Like you drive better. And that's about the general or could there specific product. So if you can have a language on asset group, it actually does help the performance of the campaign to other retailers.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: So I think I'll stop here. This is what I wanted to share.
- Me: Wonderful.
- Them: With you.
- Me: That's been really useful. Thank you.
- Them: Yeah, you're welcome. And then for tree, my door. Yeah, we talked about lowering ROAS starting mid November, so maybe the 20th and then. So for them, I still see the unprofitable, but for both of them, as they're planning to increase investment, given that there's going to be high demand when we go. So, for instance, with my door, it looks like December is going to be huge for them that they're planning to increase investment.
- Me: If the roas goes up, then I'll be increasing the investment. Yes.
- Them: Okay? And then is that the same for crowd control?
- Me: It's the same for any client to have. I can't just say I'm going to put more money into it and not get the investment back. So if the roas is there, then I'll be spending the money.
- Them: Okay, sounds good. And then, so for cross control, it's the three return. But I think you also said they care about revenue. What is the revenue from crowd control that they want to get?
- Me: As much as possible.
- Them: Okay, but to say within roas of, like, three. Okay?
- Me: I never have a client who says I need to hit a certain revenue.
- Them: I think for an option. Sorry.
- Me: I never have a client who says I want to hit a certain revenue.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It always has to be within a ROAS system. They still need to make profit.
- Them: So I will. Yeah, absolutely. So I think what we can start now is like enable AMX. For Brian to do brand inclusion on the 20 lower was crowd control.
- Me: That's all done. Yeah.
- Them: Ad asset group of, like, product categories. And then what we can do is I'm happy to have like a follow up call. Let's see. So. I think so. Within two weeks? That works for me. On the 25th or the 26th, if that's okay with you. And I think that's a good timing because we'll be going in December.
- Me: Yeah, I could deal with it. Cook me not being that weak. I mean, that's Black Friday week. I'm going to be all over the place.
- Them: Okay? Okay. No worries at all. So you want to do early December, then?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Do you want to do the second?
- Me: The second's good. Yeah.
- Them: Let me know. So I have a call attorney. Do you want to do same time? I know I feel like you like to meet earlier, but what time works for you, Peter?
- Me: Yeah, 9:30 is good. Yeah.
- Them: Nine thirty. Okay, sounds good. So some do the invite and then we'll speaking two weeks. But if I see an opportunity, I will send you by email. And then you can go ahead and reply to me. I only ask that you reply so that I don't keep bugging you with so many emails.
- Me: That's okay. That's okay. Well, the problem I have is that. I have to do this a lot. I have 12 clients.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: And it needs to be. It needs to be laser guided when I have the calls as to something specific to the client, which is what you've done today. So I do appreciate them, but I only have so much time to do them in.
- Them: Absolutely. It does make sense. It doesn't make sense. So you can let me know like next time if you want to have integrated call. We added like account managers or how you want it so that this is really time efficient. And let me know that before the call if there are specific insights that you need just to make sure these are calls are valuable. So like, for instance, like today, do you think this was like something that was valuable? And then which would you like to see more? Okay, Sounds good. Peter. Yeah, Keep bringing the feedback on how we can make this better experience.
- Me: Yes, it works. Yes, it was valuable. Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
- Them: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good, Peter. Have a good rest of your day, okay?
- Me: Thanks, maureen. Bye bye now.
- Them: Bye.

Them: Yeah, sure. Good morning.
Me: Hi, marine.
Them: Can you hear me?
Me: Yes, I can. Yes, I can.
Them: How are you?
Me: I'm very well, thank you. You.
Them: I'm doing good. It's nice to connect with you.
Me: Finally.
Them: Yes, I'm happy I was able to get your time. I know it's quite busy, so thank you for taking the time to hop on the call.
Me: No problem. I apologize. I've not been able to. I've not been that receptive. I'm creating a huge AI system at the moment, and it's just taking up all my time.
Them: You're trying to do what?
Me: I'm creating a big AI system to help run the business, so it's taking up a lot of time.
Them: Yeah. Should we? Do. Yeah. Excuse me. No, we're louis. Yeah, I know. You have been saying some of these application is actually, I have to have you on the call because some of the questions I have to ask. And just for me to kind of understand like a priorities. But the rest, if there is anything, I'm happy to follow up during that.
Me: Cool. No problem at all.
Them: It's okay, we start recording. So you said you want to do the call for 15 minutes. I didn't understand if you want shorter or like 30 minutes.
Me: I know the call is 20 minutes. That's fine. We can do that today. Not a problem.
Them: Okay, Sounds good. Yeah, I still am looking after the tree, my door and then have added is the crowd control.
Me: Yep. Yep.
Them: So can you kind of quickly walk me through? You can start maybe with the crowd control. I did look at the website, what they do. I think that as we go to the end of the year and earlier, it's kind of a good time for them because retailers Black Friday or like concert the most businesses or like, they need those type of projects. So can you kind of walk me through?
Me: Okay? Most. Businesses. Yeah, it's funny. It's more of a B to B business. You or I would not need a crowd control barrier, really, would we? It's a strange life we live in if we did need one.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. I'll look into them.
Me: So it's been B to B. It's about customer acquisition. We've got a target ROAS of about. I'd like to hit 300% on it if we can. But the client looks at Roas in terms of what is the total revenue for the business. Divided by the Google Ad spend, because that's the only marketing that they do is through Google Ads. So, yeah, there's been a few challenges with it. One of them recently is that the tracking wasn't working correctly.
Them: Yeah. I realize. Thank you very much. I apologize.
Me: In october. So we're missing some. We were missing some of the traffic and missing some of the conversions. He did work well during October. We weren't actually seeing all of the conversions that's now been fixed.
Them: Which is.
Me: And I've implemented a new conversion tracking system on there. And I think I just need to check, actually, that we are actually getting enhanced conversions coming through. Right. Still saying that cart data needs attention. Apparently with WooCommerce, which is with a platform that they're using, there has been an issue recently where it's been a penny ga underscore product id so it's not been matching up with The Merchant Center SKUs. I think I've resolved that now, but time will tell whether that's the case or not. So that's a new development. So any discrepancies there are in the conversion tracking, that's the reason for it.
Them: I see. Oh, wow. But now can we say that it's fixed? Are we still waiting to confirm if it's.
Me: It is fixed. I'm just waiting to confirm that in terms of the numbers. This could be quite a lead time on the products for this with it being B to B. But I know from looking at the stats in the admin system that it's not impacted sales, overall sales, but obviously it will be affecting the algorithm. The algorithm would have been hit during that period of time, so it may be pulling back slightly on things, which is something I need to keep track of.
Them: Yeah, absolutely. So for the in terms of the campaign structure for B2B would usually tend to see is when they sell like bundles so that they sell like more quantity, they can make more. But usually it can be a bit challenging. So it does involve like having at least trying to have like PMaxes focusing on the highest return type of product. What is the kind of structure we have in the account?
Me: Yeah. Absolutely. In terms. Of the campaign struct. Ure. Yes. So I use product hero for the structure of the account. The pmax campaigns. Well, there's two pbmax campaigns. One is the heroes and sidekicks. Which is their best target, their best Roas products. There is a villains, which is the ones that are costing them money. And then I have a zombies shopping campaign which is products which have no conversions. So that's assessed on a nightly basis as to whether it moves between those different segments.
Them: Okay? Yeah. I think that's ideal. And I looked at how were the placement for pmax.
Me: Well, placements. In what respect?
Them: Okay, because one of the things I wanted to share with you was the kind of automatic limiting the. The placement. The. The placement of low value. But we. That's why I wanted to get you on the call. We have to make sure that. Is this, like an account where we're kind of concerned of some of. The placement.
Me: Yep. Okay?
Them: So if we look at the past three months, would you say that there have been like any low quality placement? On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate to the placement from.
Me: No idea. I don't look at placements, so I'm curious to know how we'll do that.
Them: How you look at placements.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Let me share my screen. Because this can definitely help be more investment efficient. Because some of the impressions and clicks. So let's look at the last maybe three months. Yeah. So we can go to, let's just say this BMAX campaign.
Me: Yep.
Them: And then you go to report editor. And then. I'm sure it's okay. Here.
Me: Okay?
Them: Can you see it? Profiles, Max.
Me: Yep.
Them: And then we click here. Let's say. So. I feel like this is really good, actually. Most of them are, like, showing up on Google own operated, which is nice.
Me: Yep.
Them: Turned out like this third party and yahoo. I think this is okay, right? I mean, it is.
Me: Yep.
Them: A good platform.
Me: Wait. Good for remarking. Yeah, definitely.
Them: And then ebay is good. Daily Mail this. Personally, I think this is also good because I can use people go to this, right?
Me: Well, I don't know there's real news, but they do go to it for news.
Them: Yeah. And then MCN looks like there's a lot of news type of platform. Like this is what I'm saying. So I will say like for instance, on these pmax, this is personally okay.
Me: Yeah. Okay?
Them: Because like the rest are just small. Let's see. Wait, how many pmax do we have? Is this the Phoenix campaign? Okay, this is the other one. So looks like for this one though, it's showing for mobile app.
Me: I can't say it on your screen. Apart from msm. There we go.
Them: Can you see my screen?
Me: I can see app store. Yeah.
Them: So this is what I'm asking. Is this something that. Is this kind of. Because on this PMX campaign, looks like there's a lot of mobile app.
Me: Okay?
Them: Yeah. And it's quite a lot of impressions. So this is where I'll be basically, for the beta, the engineering team. Asks, like, how can we rate this? And then what are the type of placement that we don't want? And we will kind of share this. And then what they do is try to actually removing them like an automatically instead of us doing it like nine years ago. So manually you can try, but it has take so much. Time. So let me show you because not that many people do it actually, but I always recommend it. This might be helpful for your other accounts, the way you can do it manually. For instance, you saw that there are so many mobile apps on this pmax Shopping the Villains campaign and you don't want to be showing up on those at least you don't want to pay any clicks that might come from those. What you would do is you will go to right?
Me: All right. I can't do that manually, then.
Them: Okay? So you will go to tools and content, suitability. And then you see where he says exclude placement here.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And here you will just copy paste the web page of those placement that you don't like and you put them here. And then you click save.
Me: Okay?
Them: Obviously, this is really manual and you can take more time. But what I say is that still do this as a best practice every three months to just do it even on three my door. But I think as the B2B, your biggest PMAX is actually showing good places. That's good progress. Only on some of the campaigns, it's not that. Well, and then what you would do, this is how you do it manually, but for the VDA, they will do it automatically, but they still recommend if you want to do it manually, you can still do it. For me, there's like really for people, like seeing not so great placement. And then the engineering team will do it automatically. And then bi weekly they might send like a quick survey. They will send a quick server. Like, how is a performance so far? Just a quick, short survey. But basically, this is what I wanted to share with you, at least for this account. And then don't worry.
Me: Okay?
Them: Is this something you would like to do, or you want to do it manually? Because.
Me: Well, I'll give it a go manually, because at the end of the day, it sounds like a lot of to and throwing. To do it. I mean, I'm looking at. I'm looking at the campaign, the placements for Mo. Can I just share my screen, really, for a sec?
Them: Noteworth. Y overview. Absolutely. But. Yeah, go ahead.
Me: So I've just. I've just run this for crowd control. Is that the one? Where are we?
Them: I really like the last thing in your screen, by the way.
Me: There we go. That's the one.
Them: Okay?
Me: So I'm looking at this site wide and I can see that happy Color by numbers game impressions 27,502.
Them: I do like to end that word.
Me: Out of all of them. So that is a crazy amount of.
Them: Addition. Al. You would copy paste that in the next school day.
Me: So copy and paste that.
Them: So you click on it as if you're going to that web page. Take the landing page of that. And then go back to go to this is why go to Content suitability, go all the way down excluded placement and then click Enter and then copy that. Prior. Ities. No. Go back. Do that again. I don't think we saved it. Can you click Add placement?
Me: Ah, there we go. Right.
Them: And then, yeah. That's how you would do it.
Me: Okay? Well, that's good. I mean, that was a. That was a huge number coming through from that. That place.
Them: Yeah. So it's going to save so much. Doesn't make sense. Those impressions can go through another web page that it does help over time. It's not perfect, but it does help.
Me: So I presume I can't get any other information apart from impressions on that, then?
Them: No, unfortunately, that's why I say. That's why I say it's so important to kind of remove them, because for me,
Me: Okay? Y.
Them: Not so great. Okay, sounds good.
Me: Eah.
Them: For them. When I was looking at terms like opportunity for them. It is still B2B but related to businesses that would need those type of products at the end of the year, like early year. So what is kind of the plan in terms of as we go to the end of now today, what was the revenue goal?
Me: Well. I think crowd control will die off quicker than Treating My Door. Treating My Door is a gifting site. So they will run up to. Yeah, in the same sort of way as any other. Any other ecommerce business. They will run up to about 20 December peak at black Friday and probably the week or two before Christmas. So it's just case. Keep an eye on it. I know it's going to peak him a little bit earlier this year. That's what the numbers are saying. I've looked at their conversion rate for last year and trying to track it that way. And ensure there's sufficient budget there and potentially drop target row as near at the time so we can maximize the potential for it.
Them: Yeah, I think when I was looking at it, For? Let me see the tree. My door. Just to. Give you maybe some numbers in terms of like, I think there is definitely for I say AMX is actually working. It's bringing. It has been working.
Me: Yes. It is.
Them: Sorry.
Me: I'm pleased with it. I'm pleased with AI max, I think.
Them: Yeah. I think you started it for way longer. Right? I think we had discussed it. Yeah. And I'm happy that that's actually been driving conversion. So I think for them. Let me look at last month. The only other thing I wanted to mention was. Of course. Again, the. These always be challenging for them, for roas. Right. Because they have such a small priority right now.
Me: Conversion numbers are. Are low. Yes, definitely. And it's not helped with the last 30 days and being even lower.
Them: Y. Ep. So let me share my screen here. Can you see my screen?
Me: Yep.
Them: This one. Can you see it? So I'm only looking at doys is showing. So let's look at the last year.
Me: Yep.
Them: From the 12 and 12 to 24. I'm trying to look at it. So I think for them. As you can see. Yeah. Absolutely.
Me: This is for Treaty to my door, is it? Okay?
Them: So if we try to look at them.
Me: First week in December. Quite a big moment.
Them: They. 're starting? I would say starting, yes. First week of December and then still starting this 22nd. Starting the 22nd. This is looking at the conversion, so the ROAS and the conversion rate. So we can see that from 22nd the ROAS start to improve and the return and the conversion rate is quite high.
Me: Yeah. Y.
Them: But especially for December, it's, like, really grainy. So the greener it is, it means that. And you can see the conversion rate is actually consistent to 6 to 9, where before it was, like, around 2. So for this, this is where I will say,
Me: Eah. Yeah.
Them: We can see that ROAS is going to build up. So in the conversion rate is really high. So for them, honestly, I will challenge to kind of make sure they're not limiting too much the return on investment on certain campaigns.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Because when I try to look at the search campaigns here, And even on pmax, at least under search. Oh, pmax is good for the rank, but if we look at research campaign overall. Like the data structure due to rank is quite high. And it's not like the lack of investment. Well, except on this campaign. It's more of, like, return on investment. I'm trying to think if the campaigns are too spread out. Are the campaigns, like, do they have, like, different goals? These search campaign.
Me: Yes, you do. I'm in the memorial. Plants are about people dying and leaving flowers on them. Plenty of plows in the garden, memory of them. So it's not really, you know, it's not going to be seasonal as such. The roses campaigns, there's more roses in some of them. There are in winter because. Just because availability because of the weather. So their demands are very different.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Absolutely. Not. It's. Pretty secure. Obviously.
Me: Which is why they're split out the way in which they are. And then within the PMAX campaign, there's a number of asset groups covering the different sorts of products that there are. So there is a splitting out. There's no point in too much consolidation of them. And again, we're treating my door campaign. They are split out in terms of their profitability.
Them: Sometime. S. But I think we're sort of the most. Keyword. Something. Like? Well, vacation. Okay. You don't read the lineup. Public search report. So I think you've done what we can do is that for the flowers that they know their seasonal, right? In December. These are available when we have that campaign. Let's make sure the return investment is not too aggressive. And then we can leave the other search campaign. Because you can see, like, Roy just shared the Classia they had. Really good. So want to make sure that we don't miss out on that revenue that might be. In for restricting roas. But doing it strategically is doing it on campaigns where it is seasonal for them.
Me: Yep.
Them: Is that? Does that make sense, Peter?
Me: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Them: So I think once we go to end of November, that's where I would just kind of return investment by like 20 or like 30%, if possible.
Me: Absolutely, yeah.
Them: And one thing we wanted to share is that I've actually seen good results and heard good results. I've actually heard good results on AI Max 4 brand.
Me: Yes, I have as well. I've just been looking at that for somebody else that it was quite extraordinary to actually see. But it was down to using brand inclusion as well as AI Max, which was most surprising.
Them: Yeah. So I think this is something you can leverage between my door.
Me: Y.
Them: And then.
Me: Eah.
Them: Just to your point. You already know the best practice like you make sure you do. Run exclusion, please don't forget it.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But is this something you do? Because when I'm looking over, even crowd control, these are the. It's working really well. And for their brand specifically, people are still searching in a way that's really different. We can really see it, even if it's a specific brand. So with AI Max, it was still making sure that we are now missing out on those opportunities when they come up. And for us, we're still safe because we're adding the brand inclusion, like any search is going to be related to that brand. So for crowd control, even for Tree My Door, this is something I would highly recommend. But just don't forget that brand inclusion.
Me: Yep. I've just done it for treating my do I just switch AI Max and on there and I'll have a look at the brand for crowd control.
Them: Ok? Sounds good. One last thing. What do you say? Yeah, for crowd control. I know. We keep going back and forth for the two trying to look at the time and make sure we maximize it.
Me: That's okay. Okay?
Them: Where is my screen? Ok, here is my screen. I wanted to share this with you because you know how you're doing the campaigns, right?
Me: Yeah.
Them: So this is looking at this year, but we can look at the time range, maybe last year, I don't know. But this is looking at how each category is kind of performing. So in terms of what we're spending versus what we're getting, And I see that from January until now. Do you want to look at this from last year? Do you think it'll be more impactful to see what was selling like last year? Were they running ads?
Me: I think the profile has changed between last year and this year.
Them: Ok, so we can keep at this. So they're spending 9% under post op and floor standing. Yeah, but you're getting, like, a conversion. Driving is, like, 14.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And then for the wall mount, they're driving, like, 27% more. And then for the sentient, less. So I think if we try to look at this, these are, like, selling more. And the wall mount.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Is this something that the client. Do we have? Do. These categories are the same, like performance, Max campaign. Or do they have enough?
Me: Well, I'm limited in what I can do because I can set up asset groups within there. I can't split them out in separate campaigns though, and allocate different budget to it because there won't be enough conversions in those PMAX campaigns if I do split it out.
Them: No, no, no. I don't think we should split like another pmax. I wouldn't recommend it. The important thing is actually integrating as much integration as possible.
Me: Y.
Them: Where we can, but this is just to show what's actually been selling. And then for you maybe to create another asset group or making sure on the campaign where we have those.
Me: Eah. Yeah.
Them: That campaign has enough investment, at least to make sure they're not limited by investment. Because I think. The shopping villains is the one that needs more investment.
Me: No, because it's not profitable.
Them: Oh, it's not profitable.
Me: That's why it's called villains. It's not profitable.
Them: Yeah. Interesting. The name. So interesting. This campaign is driving them 3% ROAS last month.
Me: Yes, it is, because it's limiting the budget. If it had a higher budget, then those products wouldn't actually convert.
Them: Sorry.
Me: If it had a higher budget, those products wouldn't convert. It would be as tight on where it was sending them out. So that's why they sat in villains. When you say profitable, it's profitable over 60 day, period. And those products aren't likely to be profitable over that 60 day period, which is why they're.
Them: Okay, I see. So what I will say then? Let me see. Some of the things I see that could also working is when it is definitely good to if you can to have asset group of categories.
Me: Yeah, definitely.
Them: Yeah, it does help to have the language too specific to those type of project. It does help. Like you drive better. And that's about the general or could there specific product. So if you can have a language on asset group, it actually does help the performance of the campaign to other retailers.
Me: Yep.
Them: So I think I'll stop here. This is what I wanted to share.
Me: Wonderful.
Them: With you.
Me: That's been really useful. Thank you.
Them: Yeah, you're welcome. And then for tree, my door. Yeah, we talked about lowering ROAS starting mid November, so maybe the 20th and then. So for them, I still see the unprofitable, but for both of them, as they're planning to increase investment, given that there's going to be high demand when we go. So, for instance, with my door, it looks like December is going to be huge for them that they're planning to increase investment.
Me: If the roas goes up, then I'll be increasing the investment. Yes.
Them: Okay? And then is that the same for crowd control?
Me: It's the same for any client to have. I can't just say I'm going to put more money into it and not get the investment back. So if the roas is there, then I'll be spending the money.
Them: Okay, sounds good. And then, so for cross control, it's the three return. But I think you also said they care about revenue. What is the revenue from crowd control that they want to get?
Me: As much as possible.
Them: Okay, but to say within roas of, like, three. Okay?
Me: I never have a client who says I need to hit a certain revenue.
Them: I think for an option. Sorry.
Me: I never have a client who says I want to hit a certain revenue.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It always has to be within a ROAS system. They still need to make profit.
Them: So I will. Yeah, absolutely. So I think what we can start now is like enable AMX. For Brian to do brand inclusion on the 20 lower was crowd control.
Me: That's all done. Yeah.
Them: Ad asset group of, like, product categories. And then what we can do is I'm happy to have like a follow up call. Let's see. So. I think so. Within two weeks? That works for me. On the 25th or the 26th, if that's okay with you. And I think that's a good timing because we'll be going in December.
Me: Yeah, I could deal with it. Cook me not being that weak. I mean, that's Black Friday week. I'm going to be all over the place.
Them: Okay? Okay. No worries at all. So you want to do early December, then?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Do you want to do the second?
Me: The second's good. Yeah.
Them: Let me know. So I have a call attorney. Do you want to do same time? I know I feel like you like to meet earlier, but what time works for you, Peter?
Me: Yeah, 9:30 is good. Yeah.
Them: Nine thirty. Okay, sounds good. So some do the invite and then we'll speaking two weeks. But if I see an opportunity, I will send you by email. And then you can go ahead and reply to me. I only ask that you reply so that I don't keep bugging you with so many emails.
Me: That's okay. That's okay. Well, the problem I have is that. I have to do this a lot. I have 12 clients.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: And it needs to be. It needs to be laser guided when I have the calls as to something specific to the client, which is what you've done today. So I do appreciate them, but I only have so much time to do them in.
Them: Absolutely. It does make sense. It doesn't make sense. So you can let me know like next time if you want to have integrated call. We added like account managers or how you want it so that this is really time efficient. And let me know that before the call if there are specific insights that you need just to make sure these are calls are valuable. So like, for instance, like today, do you think this was like something that was valuable? And then which would you like to see more? Okay, Sounds good. Peter. Yeah, Keep bringing the feedback on how we can make this better experience.
Me: Yes, it works. Yes, it was valuable. Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
Them: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good, Peter. Have a good rest of your day, okay?
Me: Thanks, maureen. Bye bye now.
Them: Bye.
