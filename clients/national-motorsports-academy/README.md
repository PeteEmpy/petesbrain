## Relationship with NDA

**NMA is a SEPARATE client** from National Design Academy, but:
- Same point of contact (Paul Riley)
- Shares infrastructure (subdomain of NDA site)
- Same business model (lead generation)
- Different course offerings (motorsport vs design)
- Different Google Ads account
- Different budget
- **Track work separately** - use this folder for NMA work only

See `clients/national-design-academy/` for NDA work.
