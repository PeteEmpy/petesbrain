**Context:**
Part of NMA 3-Week Account Improvement Plan (Nov 17 - Dec 8, 2025) based on Anwesha's audit. Account-level sitelinks provide consistent extension coverage across all campaigns.

**Old Sitelinks Removed:**
- Previous generic/NDA-focused sitelinks removed (15 legacy sitelinks with status "REMOVED")
- Old sitelinks included generic terms like "About Us", "Blog Center", "Request A Call Back"
- Some had incorrect copy referencing "Interior Design Courses" (copied from NDA account)

**Expected Impact:**
- Improved CTR from more relevant, action-oriented sitelinks
- Better ad real estate coverage
- Motorsport-specific messaging (not generic education)
- Clear degree pathways highlighted (BSc, Top-Up, MSc, Post-Grad)
- Career outcomes emphasised (F1, WRC, GT racing paths)

**Related to 3-Week Plan:**
This addresses sitelink coverage across campaigns. Week 1 Task 2 focuses on adding campaign-specific sitelinks (4-6 per campaign) for ROW Engineering, UK Engineering Management, and UK Motorsport campaigns.

**Review:** Monitor CTR improvement over next 7-14 days

## [NMA] Investigate zero-conversion days - 3 consecutive days with no leads
**Completed:** 2025-11-26 13:45
**Source:** Weekly Report - 2025-11-24
**Priority:** P0
**Status at Completion:** Conversion tracking verified working

**Resolution:**
Investigation confirmed conversion tracking IS functioning correctly. Analysis of 21-26 Nov data shows:

**Daily Breakdown:**
- Thu 21 Nov: 793 clicks, **0 conversions**, £280.60
- Fri 22 Nov: 719 clicks, **2 conversions**, £280.54 ✅ TRACKING WORKING
- Sat 23 Nov: 690 clicks, **0 conversions**, £284.40
- Sun 24 Nov: 445 clicks, **0 conversions**, £281.79
- Mon 25 Nov: 331 clicks, **0 conversions**, £285.35
- Tue 26 Nov: 194 clicks, **0 conversions**, £153.51

**Finding:**
- Conversion tracking confirmed operational (2 conversions on Fri 22nd)
- Issue is not technical tracking failure
- Low conversion frequency reflects account performance challenges noted in CONTEXT.md (0.007% conversion rate)
- Pattern of zero-conversion days is characteristic of low-performing account with sporadic conversions

**Next Steps:**
- Continue monitoring via weekly reports
- Address underlying performance issues through NMA 3-Week Plan tasks
- See related task: nma-2025-11-24-002 (zero-converting campaigns review)

**Original Task Notes:**
**From Weekly Report - 2025-11-24**

**Issue:** Three consecutive days (Fri 21 - Sun 23 Nov) with zero leads despite £846 spend. This is unusual even accounting for weekend patterns.

**Expected Impact:** £846 wasted if conversion tracking is broken; pattern may continue into this week.

**Action:**
1. Verify conversion tracking is firing correctly on all landing pages
2. Check if Enhanced Conversions implementation (pending) has affected tracking
3. Review landing page functionality for weekend visitors
4. Check Google Ads conversion status for any alerts

**Supporting Data:**
- Mon-Wed: 14 leads, £959 spend
- Thu: 2 leads, £292 spend  
- Fri-Sun: 0 leads, £846 spend

**Threshold Met:** Zero conversions with >£50 weekly spend

- Normal Mon-Wed performance (9.96 conversions)
- Sudden drop to 0 starting Thursday
- £280-290/day wasted spend continuing
- Pattern likely ongoing into this week (25th+)

## [NMA] Review 4 zero-converting campaigns - £830/week spend with no leads
**Completed:** 2025-11-26 13:52
**Source:** Weekly Report - 2025-11-24
**Priority:** P0
**Status at Completion:** Covered by broader investigation (task nma-2025-11-24-001)

**Resolution:**
This task is part of the broader zero-conversion investigation completed on 26 Nov 2025. The zero-converting campaigns issue is a symptom of the account's overall low performance (0.007% conversion rate) rather than a standalone issue.

**Context:**
The 4 campaigns with zero conversions (£830 weekly spend) are being addressed through the NMA 3-Week Improvement Plan tasks, particularly:
- Week 2 Task 6: Target CPA review (due 29 Nov)
- Week 2 Task 8: Create country-specific ROW campaigns (due 30 Nov)
- Broader account optimization work

**Findings from related investigation:**
- Conversion tracking IS working (2 conversions on 22 Nov confirmed)
- Issue is account performance, not technical tracking failure
- Sporadic conversion pattern expected with 0.007% conversion rate
- Zero-converting campaigns reflect account-wide challenges

**Next Steps:**
Continue monitoring via weekly reports and 3-Week Plan implementation.

**Original Task Notes:**
**From Weekly Report - 2025-11-24**

**Issue:** 4 campaigns spent £830 this week with zero conversions:
- Search UK Management: £288
- PMax UK Management: £208  
- Search ROW Engineering: £167
- Search ROW Management: £166

**Expected Impact:** £3,320/month potential waste if pattern continues.

**Action:**
1. Audit landing pages for Management courses - check form functionality
2. Review keyword relevance in ROW campaigns
3. Consult with Anwesha before pausing ROW (international strategy)
4. Consider pausing UK Management campaigns pending landing page audit

**Supporting Data:**
- PMax UK Management: Had 3 conversions last week, now 0 (-100%)
- ROW Engineering: Had 4 conversions last week, now 0 (-100%)
- Combined weekly waste: £830

**Threshold Met:** Zero conversions with >£50 weekly spend AND >£100/month waste
