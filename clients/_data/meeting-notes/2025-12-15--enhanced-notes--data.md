- 'Them: Hello.'
- 'Me: Hello. There.'
- 'Them: Good.'
- 'Me: I think I got the wrong day after all that. I was beginning to think I got
  the wrong day. Then after all that. Sorry. I''ve just been sat here for a while,
  just staring out the window. Just time overtook me.'
- 'Them: How are you doing? How you feeling?'
- 'Me: Yes. Apologies for the other day. I''ve had the perfect storm over the last
  few days. With hospital points with my sister. Doctor strikes, changed appointments,
  and then Claude crashed on me over the weekend, so I''ve spent all weekend working,
  so it''s not been great. But anyway.'
- 'Them: Good.'
- 'Me: We''re here.'
- 'Them: Nearly christmas.'
- 'Me: Yes, absolutely. You know what? I absolutely hate this time of year I have
  done for last 15, 20 years. I just absolutely hate it.'
- 'Them: Oh, God.'
- 'Me: Black Friday Christmas rubbish. Marketing. It''s crazy. There''s so much commerce
  is done in such a short space of time.'
- 'Them: Yeah. See that? Intense, isn''t it?'
- 'Me: Just ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: My wife and I are going to go and work at the nursing home this weekend. This
  Christmas, rather than actually have a Christmas dinner.'
- 'Them: I feel like the same. Oh, yay. That''s nice.'
- 'Me: Kick him back. Well, hopefully we''ll be, as long as they don''t dribble too
  much.'
- 'Them: That''s a nice thing to do, though. I often think that sometimes nicest to
  do something.'
- 'Me: Wow. We also limit ourselves to 10 pound each for Christmas presents.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So that is really difficult. Really.'
- "Them: Wow. I struggle to do a Secret Santa press up for \xA310. Yeah, can like,\
  \ what do you even get a mug?"
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I''ll give you a shortcut chat. GPT does not help at all.'
- 'Them: I''ll tell you what it does help with. I. This is when the world has moved
  on. My. I''m helping my mum understand stuff to do with pensions at the moment to
  deal with. My. My dad passed away and as a result, we are. We are. I''m trying to
  work out what she''s. Due and I''ve spent an hour with chat GPT and. And now it''s
  even drafted an official letter to go back to the Department of Wages and Pensions
  to explain what she''s entitled to. It''s just mine. I spoke to at my pension guy
  and he basically said, I don''t know. That area that well.'
- 'Me: Brilliant.'
- 'Them: He goes, but I''m pretty confident if you. I''ll read it for you. And I get.
  He went, did you write this? I went, no, that''s amazing.'
- 'Me: Nice.'
- 'Them: Wow. So there you go. It can be a force for good. It can be a force for good.'
- 'Me: Nice.'
- 'Them: It can. It can.'
- 'Me: Well, on. On Sunday, I came across an 8. By Saturday, I came across an issue.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: And it turns out there''s something wrong with Claude. I spent six hours thinking
  it was me. It was actually Claude that was wrong.'
- 'Them: Who. Who would. Who would. Who would believe it?'
- 'Me: I know. Well, you don''t, do you? And so you always suspect yourself rather
  than the AI.'
- 'Them: That. And that. And that is the danger, because at the end of the day, rubbish.
  Uni''s rubbish out, I''m afraid. So if it gets hold of misleading articles, wrong
  information, then it''s only going to spuriously come back to you. But anyway.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Anyway.'
- 'Me: Apologies. I''ve started off with the right old moan. Do you want me to start
  again? Come back on again?'
- 'Them: You know what? I feel like there''s something in the. In the air lately.
  I feel like everyone I speak to, it''s quite, like, somber.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Like. Felt like you need to get some energy in.'
- 'Me: I''ll try and g up a little bit with these.'
- 'Them: It''s positivity. You''ve gone. You''ve gone for the. Your jumpers. Almost
  Christmassy, but. And quite bright, can I say? Yeah, we''ve gone for orange today.
  You''ve made a real bet.'
- 'Me: Figures. Yeah, absolutely. We''ve disgun figure a Garry.'
- 'Them: Yeah, sorry. Yeah. It''s pretty good. I did have a Christmas. I did have
  a Christmas jumper on yesterday. It was a red one. So, you know. Yeah, Sorry. Sorry.
  I should have kept that going today, but there you go, right? Remind me, do you
  share or do I share Green Pete?'
- 'Me: I will share with you.'
- 'Them: Cool. I''ll let you do. That.'
- 'Me: Tada. So one of the issues I''ve had over the weekend is it just trashed this
  report. Before I could actually do finish it off. So I''ve been redoing this. So
  apologies if there''s any glaring mistakes in this. I''ve literally been doing this
  up to five minutes ago, just tightening it up a little bit. So all good, really.
  So we reduced the spend in accordance with the budget last.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Month. That''s produced a drop in revenue, but not in proportion to the spend.
  Which was quite nice. The thing that''s making a real difference at the moment is
  reviewing this during the month to see what hotels are working, which ones aren''t.
  I think the danger is not to do it too much. I''m trying to give each property a
  decent percentage of the spend.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But I think we talked about this last time, but at the end of the day, I feel
  as though it''s been judged on roas more than anything else, rather than the number
  of bookings we''re getting for the individual hotels.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: But in some respects it has to do. Some of the hotels are more responsive to
  Google Ads than others. So many specs going for low hanging fruits. We''re fishing
  where the fish are. But I just want to flag it really, that I don''t just want to
  be chasing roas. Otherwise we''re going to end up just spending money on the Devonshire.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because.'
- 'Them: I''m debon charms. Yeah, because that was. That one does do well, doesn''t
  it? So what would you. What''s your alternative?'
- 'Me: Well, it''s just been aware of it. We could say, well, what percentage, what
  percentage of the spend do you want to spend on each hotel? And we optimize each
  one of them towards that. Towards that spend, you know, what is the expectation
  of the business for each property? And it''s a big one to say, well, what do you
  expect to get out of Google Ads for each property? Nobody knows really, do they,
  until you actually do it. We have sufficient data in here. And I think when I''m
  making suggestions to you as far as budget changes are concerned,'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: I''m conscious of. Trying to give all of them the benefit of the doubt, but
  also pushing it towards the ones that are going to give us the bookings. We start
  off the month with a proportion for each one of them.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s not helped, the PMAX thing, that we''re now two down on pmax and you
  can''t allocate individual budgets to individual hotels within pmax. You just give
  it a budget and it goes and spends it on the most lucrative of those. I don''t really
  have an answer for. You really?'
- 'Them: Yeah. I think. I think we need.'
- 'Me: Because it is mixed up with what the business wants.'
- 'Them: A. I think we''ve got to have a minimum. I don''t know what that is, but
  I think, like, we''ve got to have a minimum because I want you, right? We can''t
  get into a situation. It''s just we spend all the money on the two best hotels.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Because. Because otherwise we''re not. We''re not helping the other hotels.
  You do that for about two months and then suddenly you get the business shouting
  going. The fell. Struggling, really struggling. What we doing to help them type
  of thing.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. And that could be responsive to that. You know, if there is a seasonal
  drop for a hotel, and I could always increase the budget if it seemed to be a separate
  marketing span for that.'
- 'Them: But you, as you say, it''s. I mean, it''s so intent driven, though, isn''t
  it? So, like, you know, I can''t. We can''t magic conversions if they''re not, you
  know, if the market isn''t there to do it. So I feel like, you know, it is a bit.
  Of a. A mixture in terms of that strategy because, you know, we''ll take your expertise
  and your guidance in terms of where that budget is best, then. You know, with the
  expectation that ultimately we''re looking for more sales. So wherever that needs
  to be is where it needs to be. And then that''s the conversation I can have this
  side. And just to manage expectations, to say, look, you know, based on however
  long we''ve been running these campaigns, Devon''s performance really well on paid
  search and on performance, Max fell less. So we therefore recommend we have. Do
  you know what I mean? Like, that''s the kind of story that can say,'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that''s why I have in my mind''s eye when I''m doing
  it. Yeah, definitely. You know, if it says if. If the. If the budget looks like.
  Or we should be spending two quid on the Bailey, I''m gonna go, no, we can''t actually
  do that. A reasonable amount in. There.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So I''m. I''m just. I''m just. I''m flagging it, really, just to, you know,
  say I. I don''t want to get to that point. And there will be allowances if I, you
  know, I''m coming back saying 745roas would be, you know, that''s. Fantastic. Well,
  yeah, I could probably get that higher than that if we just went. If we just went
  for the. For the. The Devonshire.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But.'
- 'Them: Am I right in thinking that last month when we, you know, did that. And so
  we had a really good roas. For Devon trams, and then we upped the budgets, but it
  didn''t necessarily convert the same rate as maybe we were expecting that.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Overall, the budget. The, the. The extra money we put into it gave us
  an increase in budget in roas. Overall.'
- 'Them: Yeah, okay.'
- 'Me: So it did have an effect. It''s, it''s. It''s difficult to be granular on that
  because halfway through the month, the budget had to come down anyway.'
- 'Them: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Me: Because it was running well at the beginning of the month, we were going to
  overspend on the. On the main budget. So it''s not as though I''m just looking at
  the budget and saying, let''s split it into, into 30 parts and that''s how much
  it''s going to spend every day. Because we came down from. Well, there was a, what,
  21% drop in spend last month. So that has to be brought down gradually. I can''t
  just say on the, on the last day of the month, right, next tomorrow it''s going
  to be that much, because it really would upset the apple cart. So it''s a, it''s
  a bit of a moving target, but overall, it did improve the rug. Well, you can see
  from that, you know, 22% of month on month.'
- 'Them: It. Always starts in the. Yeah. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: It''s. It''s. It''s improved the roas. It had the positive effect on it.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Okay? So the individual hotel performance. So, again, I''ve. I''ve consolidated
  these together from the search and from the pmax.'
- 'Them: It''s just.'
- 'Me: The usual. The usual suspects. I mean, the Bailey''s done really well this
  month. Is there a specific reason for that, do you think, or not?'
- 'Them: The pretty question. No, not really. Not really? Not been running in particular.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay, and then. So Devon Shire and then Chatsworth. The Fell was the
  underperformer, along with the Pilsley. They were both below target. Again, I, I
  have no reason for, for, for a technical viewpoint why that would be the case. But
  they''ve, they''ve not done particularly well this month. Was it last month that
  fell weren''t doing very well as well?'
- 'Them: The fellas haven''t done well all year, so. But there''s quite a bit in the
  SEO report as well around that as well.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay, good. Because I think like the and this is actually part of separate
  note that, Garry, just our conversation around that stay and dine package and all
  that tracking. So one of the things that I''m being pushed on is putting more budget
  behind some social advertising specifically for staying down. But currently I''m
  struggling to understand a roas because I don''t know whether it''s going to hurting
  on that package or something else. So that''s kind of like a bit of an area as well
  in itself is that, you know, from my perspective, Richard is saying, yeah, you know,
  we need to spend the money, let''s spend the money, like, you know, if. Let''s put
  it against what''s working. But for the fell, I feel like we''re not really seeing
  great performance on ppc, and I don''t really know why. Like, so it''s hard to then
  go back and say, right, okay. You know. Yeah. Let''s budget. Well, there''s two
  things I''d say. One, in terms of the I''ve got to find out if it''s even possible
  to get that data. It might not be, and I don''t know if we can even associate it
  to a campaign because the report you looking at. Even if there was data in there,
  wouldn''t associate it to an individual campaign that way. We''ll have to think
  about that separately, but I''m sure it can be done. But I don''t. Not within the
  current parameters. Okay, but. But in terms of just. Is the offer being taken up?'
- 'Me: Off the. Big take.'
- 'Them: The date. The data that Lena sent us I can use. That definitely is. There''s.
  There''s loads. There''s plenty of proof in there that I think the office working.
  Whether or not it''s coming via social, I couldn''t tell you. In terms of the. In
  terms of the fell demand. There is a mass like and this. And to your point earlier.
  If the demand isn''t there, there is little. I was saying to the guys that as the
  G earlier this week, they were like, what? What? You know, they. They were looking
  at me, and they desperately didn''t want to say this because they''d hate saying
  it, but I. I said it for them. There isn''t anything they can do because you can''t
  magically make people demand looking for the Fed. Yeah. You can improve the non
  brand stuff, which is what they''ve done, and that''s, that''s all gone up. Yeah.
  But, yeah, the brand is down, and. And this is. I''m trying to think of the nicest
  ones I can say this to you, and I''m struggling to say how to say it to Rachel.
  The whole brand thing is struggling since the rebrand.'
- 'Me: S.'
- 'Them: Because the Devon shirt was a respected, well known brand.'
- 'Me: The. Champion wasn''t.'
- 'Them: And you can see it like I. Because I did a bit of a review of your Google
  business profile for the high because we were just checking some data. There''s
  a lot of you can see. I don''t think even I realized how respected Chatsworth and
  Devonshire brands were. Because you''ve seen it, because you were there. And you
  told me a couple of anecdotal stories. But there''s a lot of people going under
  the premise of this. Is now the Devonshire. This is now the Chatsworth. And it''s
  not the level they were expecting. Which then means people now that the dev. Now,
  the fell isn''t the Devonshire fell. It''s. It''s lost a lot of momentum. Yeah.
  Devon sharms. Well, because it still says Devonshire.'
- 'Me: Expect. Ing.'
- 'Them: Because I think, like, and it may be that come through in the SEO report
  and it''s the stuff that I would look, if I had more know, I would say if I had
  more time, if I had more time to dig into some of this, like, it would make it so
  much easier. So if you do have any of that sort of data to show pre post rebrand
  and the impact that''s having like that would be so helpful. Just because I''m struggling,
  because obviously I''ve joined, rebranded, done, or it''s underway, and I''m like,
  you know, implementing what''s already been, you know, well underway. So I''m now
  having to try and work out what we do with the fel with, you know, and essentially
  it is start. Again, like, you know, in terms of how can we launch the Fell as a.
  As its own thing. It needs positioning, it needs everything. But obviously, in this
  interim period, We still need to make money. So that''s where we''re being pushed
  for, you know. I say we, so I''m being pushed for, you know? If that package is
  working, let''s push that package. If this, you know, can we put more ppc? What
  can we do? Like, it''s. That''s the push back. I''m going. I think the two obvious
  things to do are we''ve got loads of data already on the lack of the brand. Terms
  being used now, so we can put that in into it. But also it''s probably worth looking
  at just visitor numbers.'
- 'Me: Today.'
- 'Them: For the old site under the fell and the new site, and just seeing it''s.
  It''s exposure, because there''s two sides of it, is, oh, we get enough people.
  Look, are we getting enough people from marketing point of view and are we getting
  the conversion and. They''re two different things. It may be. Both. It may be one,
  it may be the other, I don''t know. So I''ll have a look. So many plain, so many
  like moving parts as part of it isn''t there because like with a relaunch, with
  a new site that has a knock on effect, it''s like it''s at this point now where
  we know six months in, just being able to start thinking right, okay, what can we
  attribute to the loss here? Like, where is this? What''s the source? So that''s
  the bit that, you know, needs to be revisited. And I''m conscious to not be the.
  You know, I''m. I am a bit like, I think you are as well, a data person at heart.
  Yeah, yeah. So, so, you know, and I used to own a user experience company, so I,
  I understand that, but, you know, I''m, I''m very conscious of that. I am probably
  not the brand person. And the problem is, too, it''s too easy for me to say, I don''t
  think the user experience is as good on the news site because I don''t. It isn''t
  best practice and I, and I think it''s too brand led and less data led. But, but,
  but we both know going back to the business and just saying that without evidence
  is, Is true. Yeah. And. And, and I am a supplier with Pete. It''s your job, so I
  don''t want to get you in trouble. No, exactly. Yeah. Okay. All right. Anyway, yeah,
  that would be. That would be great. Thank you, Garry.'
- 'Me: And this isn''t the level of detail that you want. I actually did this brand
  versus non brand analysis on the, on the PPC campaigns.'
- 'Them: O.'
- 'Me: For, for the last 30 days. And I mean it''s, it speaks for itself really. When
  you look at the click through rates on the, on the top right of brand versus on
  brand and the roas is, and it''s like.'
- 'Them: H. Yeah. Okay, great.'
- 'Me: It''s kind of obvious, but as you say, we''re data driven. That is the data.
  Now, the caveat to this is that as far as Brand is concerned, we''ve got Bee, Lee
  and Pilsley in there, which aren''t necessarily Brand, but at least surfacing those
  that we would deem to be brand, which is the calm edition and the damage. And you
  can see. Yeah, you can see them. It''s a. It''s a massive brand. The Devonshire
  Arms is just a huge brand, isn''t it? You can see Bolton Abbey as well, how big
  that is. There''ll be small, smaller numbers on. There. But again, we''re back to
  fishing where the fish are. You know, when we took off the. The negative keyword
  for the Devon share, all of a sudden, whoosh, up it goes, and there is the. We don''t
  want to be cannibalizing it. But we, you know, we''ve. We''ve had this discussion
  before about occupying real estate on the, on the search page on Google, which is,
  which is what we''ve got to do, really.'
- 'Them: And the truth is, that''s only getting worse. It''s getting harder for. For
  organic to get at the top of the page. We might be the top. We are generally the
  top three or four ranked listings for Devon Girms, but that doesn''t always get
  you in the top half of someone''s screen.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: Anyway. Back to where I was. Just met you, Desi, for a minute.'
- 'Them: Make it so hard for us, don''t they?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So you spend more money with them. It''s pay to play territory now, isn''t
  it?'
- 'Me: I mean, you look at people like Amazon. It''s been like that for years. It''s
  just creeping into everything, isn''t it? I. I was. I was reading something today
  about.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Is it? Something like $210 billion is going to be transacted through as a result
  of chat GPT this year on Christmas shopping. It''s just an enormous amount. Absolutely
  enormous. And that is just with people playing with it. You know. Oh, I did this
  the other day. It''ll soon become. Well, it''s the same as I''ve always done on
  Google. It wouldn''t be a. A great thing. So. I''ve got a. There''s an issue with
  November''s figures. On this. On this chart, not with the ones that we''ve just
  been looking. We''re doing the year on year figures. This. I don''t. When did you
  start, Helen? Right. Okay, so last year we had an issue with the conversion tracking.'
- 'Them: Breathe.'
- 'Me: In that the Highwayman conversion tracking was on. On some. On the. The hotel
  pages. As. As a result of that, it was showing that there was something like 1,
  700 conversions for November. So there was two separate conversion options. So that''s
  skewing the figures. So it''s when you see the conversion. Rate and conversion percentage
  change on here is not necessarily correct.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: I am working on that. That''s what I was doing 15 minutes ago, so apologies
  for that. I''m still working my way through it. The. The figures. The. The figures
  are. Are looking good on there, anyway. It''s not going to make a huge amount.'
- 'Them: We''re at the anniversary, aren''t we? That would. It was November was when
  it launched, so.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So you can see the conversion rate on that one. The
  absolutes. That''s clearly not correct. The rest of the figures are fine. Conversions,
  roas cost and so on. And conversion value.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Is literally just that conversion rate. So the news is, the news is good year
  on year.'
- 'Them: Okay, great.'
- 'Me: We''re still tracking in the right direction. I just did a quick. Analysis
  on year. On year. So. Oh, it''s just going to be one of those days. There. Would
  you excuse me just for one minute? The dog''s just arrived, panting like mad, and
  there''s going to be a puddle on the floor if I don''t let him out.'
- 'Them: No worries.'
- 'Me: So posies for this. Just one sec.'
- 'Them: Okay? Great. Well. Where are the. Where are the other priorities? Is it.
  Is the fell the big. Is it still that one or any other? Like it just feels very
  difficult currently. We have a look at the revenue report now that you know. Lena
  came through yesterday, and she said they were, like, barely any sales. Over the
  weekend. Wow. Yeah.'
- 'Me: When you get to a certain age, when you''ve got to go, you''ve got to go. And
  he''s up that certain age, the dog.'
- 'Them: I was trying to distract Helen by talking about stuff. But now I''ve depressed
  her because I made a look at revenue report.'
- 'Me: Without a president.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I''ve made a look at revenue reports on. Apparently they''re not good,
  so it''s. It''s okay. Right. December. Looking pretty empty next week. Very empty.
  January. Yeah, really, like, loads and loads of rooms still. But then, equally,
  we haven''t launched our new, like, packages, so we''re just finalizing. Or packages
  for next year, so. Or next quarter at least. So we''re going to do like a nine on
  us kind of situation where we across all the group, we have lunch or dinner included.
  Or you get it for free, basically, as part of that price. It''s not like a would
  be really mindful how we phrase it, because it doesn''t sound like it''s just a.
  A rate that we offer for, you know, better breakfast or, you know, dinner, bed and
  breakfast. It is free. Like the actual but we can''t say free because it''s not
  on brand.'
- 'Me: Complimentary.'
- 'Them: So I don''t envy you at times. I know. So that''s the package that we''re
  launching across everything next quarter, but that will run from January through
  to March. Cottages. We''re going in with quite an aggressive rate. In January, we''re
  going to be, like, discounting 20% pretty much on most. Across the group. Just TBC
  on a few things on that. And then we''ll have some dining offers which are, like,
  local. So we''ll do. We''re doing like a restaurant tour kind of stamp initiative,
  where you have to visit every single property, spend 50 quid and then you''ll get
  50 quid free on. Your fourth visit and entry into a prize draw for a free. Stay
  over somewhere. Mowgli are doing that. That''s the Mowgli. Oh. Could you send me
  a photo there? Create it. Yeah, it''s. It''s like credit. Yes. It''s a passport.'
- 'Me: That''s a great idea.'
- 'Them: Ah, okay, cool. We''re doing, like, a little. We''re going to do a stamp,
  so actually, you can go in your wallet. Better. I think best chance of me, less
  chance of me forgetting to take it. Anyway, I''m doing that now. Yeah. Thank you.
  So, yeah, so it''s kind of. We haven''t launched those yet, so we''ve got the revenue
  call tomorrow to go through kind of any more outstanding things. I imagine it will
  be quite. Push, push, push. To get stuff through. So we''re just in the middle of
  getting landing pages all sorted, but sell continues to be problem as to cottages,
  but obviously. I know we''ve had separate chat about that. Have you always. I know.
  Sorry. You might come onto this, Pete, but have you reverted the ad to the old landing
  page now for cottages? Yeah. Amazing. Thank you. So, yeah, I fed back that that
  landing page. Kind of a B test hasn''t really worked and we need to revisit. Actually
  thinking about proper build and. Redesigning it. And I think Richard and Rachel
  may be quite surprised if they thought the original design was based on Airbnb.
  So they''re quite surprised. It''s not working, but it''s not based on Airbnb. Yeah.
  So I was like, well, we just. It''s not converting, so we need. To do something
  about it. We will. Our maps team is looking at building as a new map, but I just
  kind of feel like rather than everything work in silos, this needs to be one big
  conversation around engagement conversion rate what we want.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then work backwards rather than now. Maps team go work in isolation and
  build our map and us think about what they need to look like. I do know what I mean.
  I just would rather it all be one big project. So the plan is maybe as an interim
  do something like that''s ok, we''ll continue. Working on that as a project and
  actually have that mapped out. I''ll speak to you separately, Garry, on what we
  want to do. But the other thing is, what we have seen has worked well, is we have
  a campaign called River Y25 for our upper Dale. Cottage collection, and that''s
  25% off. That''s been running a while. Like, a while now. And I set that up as a
  separate package. On our website. And I think. And that''s worked really well, and
  obviously it''s discounted, so that''s worked well. But they had some amazing kind
  of like, conversion off the back of that. And I think it was all to do with the
  fact that it was one landing page. Here are the cottages. Like, and it was just
  simple. And then they, you know, you click through to individual landing pages to
  see more about the cottage. But actually, that booking and everything was just easy
  because it was just built as one package, so that might be the interim that we then
  moved to. So we have kind of a separate. We have a page that is like chat. Go back
  to the collections pre me, but it was like Chatsworth collection. Up a Dale collection.
  Ball, Cross, Heath, Lee. And then maybe that might make things a bit clearer. Let''s
  see for now. That could be the interim.'
- 'Me: It was interesting from those stats though, to see the percentage of people
  looking because it was interesting. Watch your hands as well, because you talking
  about that. But it''s actually like that, isn''t it? You know, it''s the. It''s
  mobile, and it. It made such a huge difference doing those screenshots. To see what
  they actually look like to someone who was searching.'
- 'Them: Yeah, they just caught. There''s too much image. There''s two bigger image
  at the top, isn''t it?'
- 'Me: Well, even the corner. The callers on the bottom right hand corner covered
  a huge amount of space. It didn''t look proportional to mobile look the same size
  as it would have done on desktop, not occupying a huge amount of space. And that
  had it. That''s going to have an effect.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So it''s. It''s almost. They obviously are doing this, but it, you know, like,
  designed for mobile. Rather than having that idea of having the cottage in that
  side and the. And the map on that say, well, how does that actually look? When you
  get on mobile.'
- 'Them: Nothing on that site was designed for mobile, I''m afraid. No, it really
  wasn''t. It was designed. It was designed for Brand. That''s what will happen then,
  Garry. Obviously, I wasn''t here then. Do you think that was. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Oh, wow.'
- 'Them: Seong pointed it out. I pointed it out. And at the time. Yeah. And it was.
  We, we were just like, it''s not as mobile friendly as. As we''d like it to be.
  But of course, the problem is SEO. G''s remit is more around SEO. And so they, they
  know, they know ui. I know, I know ux. So we, you know, the truth is, you. Know,
  a year ago, we came up with a design for a new cottages page, which was pretty much
  just land and see all the cottages and have some really cool filters at the top.
  And that''s all it was. Yeah. And then it got. It got stopped because I said, we''re
  going to redesign the entire site. Which made sense. There''s no point, because
  it would have been, you know, not a quick project. But the truth is, that was then.
  You know, it. It''s again, as Pete said. It starts with a big, beautiful image.
  I know. Nobody needs a big, beautiful image. I''ve gone. This is a landing page
  for people who''ve gone. I want to look at cottages. So show me some cottages. I
  don''t even. I get the idea of the redesign, the map, the. The thing you showed
  us does look much better. But with the greatest respect, the people who are looking
  for it aren''t looking for where am I exactly on this map? They just want to see
  what the patterns look like, isn''t it? I think that comes later in the journey.
  Oh, hang on, where is it positioned in like, in relation to things I want to. Be
  doing while I''m there? Because it''s all in the same area. It''s not like it''s.
  It''s. It''s not like it''s a UK wide map. I know.'
- 'Me: It''s another term.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. When you know this, you know this. I know. Okay, we''ll put.
  We''ll pick it up separately. Yes. People will keep it moving, though. I will. The
  agenda.'
- 'Me: Also good news.'
- 'Them: I''d love that, actually.'
- 'Me: Revenue growth up 92% year on year, so conversion up 62%.'
- 'Them: Cheer us up.'
- 'Me: ROAS has improved from 4.3 to 6.38. This is comparing four years. And the revenue
  conversion. This is. This might just be inflation, but it''s gone up from 4:30 to
  5:11.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So, yeah, September peak. And the nice thing, I suppose for us is that we''re,
  we''re 7.5% average ROAS for Q3. So it''s all that work that we did in in earlier
  on in the year is, is actually paying off now and just that around a budget, so.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That is good. The only thing I would say is it''s just being able to
  paint a picture, obviously, because we have increased spend. If you look like year
  on year,'
- 'Me: That''s the roas. So we increased roas 48.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That''s my thing. That''s the rows going up when we''ve increased the
  spend is. That''s, that''s the bit that I''m. Because otherwise, you know, those
  figures are great. But then the answer is always, ever. We spent more money, so
  you''d hope so. Like. So as long as we can make that, we''re happy with that, Roas
  figure that''s something I can take away and be like, look, what a win. You know,
  we''ve been a really efficient with budget. And then again, that just opens up the
  door of being able to say, look, we need to spend because this is our untapped potential.
  You know, here''s what we could be doing, and then back to our original chat right
  at the beginning. And here''s where we, you know, we know it''s working. Let''s
  put more behind that, and then we can go from there.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I''m not going to continue to do that with a, you know,
  contacting you in the month just to say there is, there are all limited by budget
  at the moment.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But it was really. It''s a case. This first week is letting it all settle down
  after the, the, the big drop in budget. So the roas might be because we''ve reduced
  budget and it''s having to work harder. So I just have to make sure that there is
  actually potential there. And these strategic, you know, just for a couple of weeks.
  Increasing budget aren''t the most efficient way of doing things, but they do actually
  pay off. So just got to. Just got to be careful with it. It''s very easy to say
  you can go and spend an extra 200 pound a month, about a day if you wanted to, and
  you''re going to get more money, but I can''t categorically say that right now,
  today.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. But then I''m now going to go back to the beginning again
  anyway, so maybe we need to think about what that base rate needs to be.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. The base rate for roas.'
- 'Them: No, in terms of spend, so that it doesn''t feel like such a big jump.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yes.'
- 'Them: Back down again.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. It''s. It''s the. The. The tricky one when that is, with it being
  seasonal, isn''t it? You know, we''re going to be chucking more money at it. So
  the. I mean, the. The market is spending the way is at the moment. At least I''ve
  got something to aim at. And I can, you know, towards the end of one month, when
  I know it''s going to go down, I can actually start to scale it down towards the
  end of a month. Why we ended up with a little bit more the end of the month.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. So I''m going to be intrigued to see because obviously
  I''ll be here a full year. From end of February, but I just. I''ll be intrigued
  to see what January is like because. You know, is the demand going to be there,
  like, based on, you know, appetite to spend?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Or do people want to? I don''t know. It''s a hard, you know, hard industry
  to. Know what the.'
- 'Me: They all are this year. Is that It''s. Is that financial insecurity? You know,
  I''ve not. Friday has not been brilliant.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It certainly hasn''t been the huge thing. It normally is as huge, but then
  again, some people are saying it''s great.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Could we see actually over. Over time? What would be handy is even
  if. I don''t know if there''s a category thing or whether it''s a. But just to see
  that volume over time, just so that we''re able to see, like, search volume over
  time.'
- 'Me: But not what I''m. Doing impressions. Okay? It? Well, it''s going to be directly
  proportional to spend.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, if you know about might not work.'
- 'Me: You know?'
- 'Them: Then.'
- 'Me: Well, we''ll get that kick back again. The thing that''s happened this year,
  of course, is CPCs have gone up as well, so you can''t necessarily match.'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: The two of them, I mean. CPCS is going to be down to clicks, Impressions is
  going to be down to visibility, but also what our targets are. I''m trying to maintain
  the target ROAS that we aim for to 5, 70%.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: I don''t want to move that around too much because that really does throw all
  the. All the toys out the pram.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, that''s fine, actually. That''s another just being mean to
  know about CPTs going up. That''s another thing. That would be good.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Again just to highlight, because if it''s again that Roas picture, really
  strong year on year. Despite increasing cpc. Do you know what I mean? Like, just
  some of that messaging is quite handy for me to, like, relay back.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no problem. I mean, the, the CPCs across the board in
  Google Ads have gone up quite dramatically recently because of the introduction
  of pmax. It used to be that if you wanted to bid on someone else''s brand, that
  you would put a search campaign out there with their, their keywords in the. In
  the. The. The search campaign.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Now, you just put a PMAX campaign out there and it''ll do it for you anyway.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: So it''s just whether you like it or not. So that''s then pushed up the competition
  for the, for the, the brand. So it''s also about impression share as well. You know,
  where do we, where do we sit?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, okay.'
- 'Me: Are we? I''ll we. Are we catering for the same amount of people as we were
  originally in terms of the size of the market? So I could do. I could do some impression,
  share stuff.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay, no worries.'
- 'Them: Thank you.'
- 'Me: I''m flicking over these because I''m just reading these, these bullet points
  as we''re, as you''re looking at the, at the graph, so they''re all there afterwards
  if you need to see them. So that''s, that''s just the profitability. It doesn''t
  necessarily give the full picture because it''s down to volume. The nice thing with
  the Devonshire is it''s getting a high roas and it''s getting a. A decent level
  of. Level of bookings, whereas the. The Beely is more restricted on bookings. But,
  yeah, it smashed it out of the part this month.'
- 'Them: Right. Thank you.'
- 'Me: Okay, so the locations. Not a huge amount to report on that because the Bolton
  Abbey Escape location has been. Has been stopped. Because after our discussion.
  So that was reallocated that the money that was going on there. So the hide. This
  is. This has been pretty good. I''m pleased with this.'
- 'Them: Okay, good. Good.'
- 'Me: Well, 427, 423, and it''s really the first full month.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- "Me: So the algorithm is. Is now learning. Or has lurched, let's say. So we're,\
  \ we're seeing that, that improvement. So 20 bookings. I mean, click through rate\
  \ is fantastic. 20.9. That's, that's better than some of the core properties. So\
  \ it's, it's heading the right way. I mean, we, we're still on a 2,000 pound budget.\
  \ I went slightly over last month, so it's under \xA33 over, so I'll try and pull\
  \ that. Back this month."
- 'Them: Yeah. That''s all right.'
- 'Me: So.'
- 'Them: I know I''m asking a lot. Sorry. I know I''m asking a lot, but just only
  click through rate then. And you said, oh, no, that''s a great click through rate.
  Again. It''d be really good if we could just establish, like, what''s an all right,
  click through rate, and then so we know what above averages. So it just makes it
  a bit easier again, so I can say, oh, yeah, like click through rates. Because it''s
  just that. So what kind of conversation that I then rely.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, I know what you mean.'
- 'Them: So I think you know how we defining. What good is so that I can say, yeah,
  we smashed out the part because our average click through rate is 15% but hide is
  20. Do you know what I mean?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, well, this is going to be easier when I. When I put all this onto
  the same table.'
- 'Them: It''s. Just some of that storytelling. On the same table. Yeah, exactly.
  Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So I''ve kept it off for now because this is the first month.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That it''s been on its own. That It''s. It''s been fully running for a month.
  So the campaign. I''ll put the hide with the others.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Next month. So I''m reporting the whole lot in at the same thing. But I''ll
  also keep things like this graph going.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Great. Yes. Yeah, great.'
- 'Me: So that you can see. So. So when you say about ctr, that''s, that''s giving
  you the.'
- 'Them: Yeah. There we go. That''s much easier to see.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Impressions is going to go up because you''re spending more anyway. But, you
  know, the CTR is, is extraordinary.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Compared to last month and then compared to. I mean, I don''t know about. Over
  in January over here. Is this a seasonal thing? We don''t. We don''t really know
  yet. Whether it is or it isn''t. But I''ll keep this one going and I''ll put the.
  I''ll put the hide on with the others.'
- 'Them: Great. Thank you. I. I would. What I would suggest is that in January the
  click through rate was unusually high for across the the board.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Like, if I look. If I look back to last year for all the hotels, for January,
  for all the hotels, it was. It was very high. So I. So I think January is just a
  little bit of a freak month. I. I think you look the. The core part of the year
  is where most things are and that and. It pitches it. You know? The rest of the
  hotels rarely get. You know, their average is less than 10%, so.'
- 'Me: It''ll be interesting to see how that Ctr Murray is up against conversion rate
  as well. Is it just browsers in January.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, is it. The dream is just, you know, sat there after with a hangover
  on. On New Year''s Day, actually looking at. Looking at where they can''t go, where
  they can''t afford to go. Who knows? It just come into your mind then? You were
  talking before about packages and so on. It''d. Be really good to know what they
  are. And put some of these on site links on the on the.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yes. I think you have staying down on there already for the foul because
  I think I must have mentioned that about a million times, but I''ll stay in time.
  God.'
- 'Me: That was. Even if they''re individual ones and there''s a. There''s a time
  limit on them, I can always put that on. If it just increases the ctr, then. Then
  even better.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s fine. Great.'
- 'Me: So this is the self catering properties. So hunting town, Russian cottage.
  They would, they would stop when you, when we, we talked about it at the beginning
  of, at the beginning of last month.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: Chats with the state cottages again. It''s going to be. It''s going to be brand
  live, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The roas was. I mean, roas is great.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s just getting those bookings up. I mean, I''m saying Roys is great, but
  I''m based upon.'
- 'Them: Because they''re so expensive.'
- 'Me: You can''t really. You know, it could just be one really big one, couldn''t
  it? I mean, that''s the thing with the. The self catering that they could.'
- 'Them: No, probably not. To be honest, it''s so expensive, the cottages, it''s insane.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, you look at this date. We''ve got two bookings at 3748.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So. But it''s just. Yeah, it''s just trying to get them. To try to get them
  too far off. And again, if you''ve got any. Any specific packages on these or, or
  points of interest.'
- 'Them: The only thing we''re running for across everything is the late 20. Kind
  of availability. So they get to. They book within 14 days. Of the stay, they get
  20% off. That''s that runs nonstop.'
- 'Me: So if they book for the next time after they''ve. After their first day.'
- 'Them: No, if they like. So if they want to book a last, it''s like a last minute
  deal, basically. So say I want to go in 13 days time I can.'
- 'Me: Okay? So. I see, right.'
- 'Them: 20 off. So that runs non stop.'
- 'Me: I. I won''t do that cycling until I''ve passed it by you because I''m sure
  there''s some little bits of constraint.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Late availability, free stay.'
- 'Me: They leave it with me. Just imagine.'
- 'Them: We don''t. We don''t have loads of availability. Nothing''s free. But it''s
  a full cot. It''s a beautiful cottage, though, with some wonderful amenities.'
- 'Me: English heritage.'
- 'Them: God. Worked with us too long, Garry. Have you. Have you seen the views? The
  views are amazing. Access to nature. That''s another lovely one. Unrivaled views.'
- 'Me: I don''t.'
- 'Them: I''m just going to put in. We''re not. We''re not supposed to use hyperbole,
  but. No, I know. Got to be careful.'
- 'Me: I''ve just put in there about the. The landing page experiment. Lovely. Thank
  you.'
- 'Them: Only the right setting. Yeah. Which would be nice. There''s a complete failure.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well. I think. I think one of the, the, the issues.'
- 'Them: Complete failure. December 2nd. Got you. Loud and clear. Stop.'
- 'Me: Label the point. I think one of the issues is that because the conversion rates
  are so low and with the the spend is relatively low, he was giving it enough clicks
  to make a difference. I think essentially the way to do a landing page experiment
  in the future is more than nuclear approach, which is what we did the first time,
  wasn''t it? You know, we had just the image and then we moved to the filtered page
  where we did the, the, the jump down to the, to the bookmark. And then at least
  we can, we can do a like for like comparison then. But we suddenly halve the budget
  by doing a split AB test. We either run it for twice as long.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Or double the budget. So I''ve sent you the email about that. That''s just
  a. Just a, a summary of, of what that was.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Great. Thank you.'
- 'Me: So that''s your brand versus non brands. So weddings. There we go. That was
  weddings.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: And then exclusive venues.'
- 'Them: No, for the moment, because we still in hand. I''m not sure Rachel knows
  when they''re. When they''re going live.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Is that. Is that a Q on, then? Will it be?'
- 'Them: Oh, if we''re lucky.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: If we''re lucky. I think. Yeah, there''s. Yeah, there''s. There''s. There''s.
  I think. I think the caravan''s probably. My guess is, based on the conversations,
  Helen''s more privy than me, but I think the caravan is probably. Distracted the
  attention away for a period of time. So I think. At least I would say. The sensible
  thing is, old Devonshire would have gone. We. We need to move these out the caravan.
  Well, I need you to do both. I think there is at least a sense of. Yeah, let''s
  do the caravans first. Let''s get that right. And then let''s do so. I. I suspect
  the cat. A new. A completely new campaign around caravans will come before we move
  those. Those exclusive venues because I think the exclusive values are quiet.'
- 'Me: Okay? Because. I think. Okay?'
- 'Them: Because it''s about. It''s about what we do with the hall. Seems to be the.
  The difficult conversation. Lismore is going to be. Lismore escapes and it will
  have care evil on it as well. It''s. It''s what we do with the whole. I think, because
  it could. Does it go on Spolton Abbey Escapes, does it not? And all that sort of
  stuff. Because I. I think Helen and me have all, you know, voiced our opinions about
  the Fell getting lost. I think the fell will get lost even more if you suddenly
  chuck the hall on there because the hall has got a massive amount of content with
  it. You''ll just think you''ll go on to bowl and Abby scouts and you''ll. You''ll
  think that it''s either Devon''s, your arms. Or the hall. You know, it''s just so
  hard to get. I mean, like. The number of clicks it takes to get through to anything.
  From the home page. It''s just wild. And we both know that site a lot. And every
  time I go onto it, God, no, I''ve got. I have. You can imagine the kind of conversations
  I have with, like, ops. Like, they''re, like, can''t find anything on their website.
  That website''s awful. I''m like, thank you. It''s really helpful. No one can. No
  one can find anything. I''m like, okay. Why don''t you go and tell Rachel rather
  than tell me? And she''s not even Rachel, is it? Let''s be honest. Not really. I
  know it''s above Rachel. Unfortunately, it is. I know there''s bits of it that are,
  but bits that aren''t really. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, it looks nice. It does
  look good. But you know. Looks much nicer than the old one. Did I?'
- 'Me: It''d be nice with a lemon to try a non American audience as well and see what
  happens. Yeah. Because it''s only aimed towards America. Yeah, we know.'
- 'Them: But all the evidence shows it''s only the Americans that are booking it,
  so. Yeah. Yeah, it''s not a. I. I think I''d be surprised if there isn''t a Japanese
  audience.'
- 'Me: Is it really?'
- 'Them: But there doesn''t appear to be much of a UK. Feel to it at all. It''s very
  expensive.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay? Is it?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I can imagine. Not as though I''ve never tried to rent a castle, but I can
  imagine.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. I don''t tend to do that much as. And even as castles goes, it''s
  quite. I have had a little look when we did some testing research stuff around and,
  and even by castle renting standards, it''s quite expensive. Cost. But you get.
  You get so much for it. Like I say that. But if you. If you. If you were a person
  of money. You''d pick that over a lot of the other options because it is really,
  really good. Like, the service and everything that comes with it is brilliant, if
  that''s what you''re looking for. Just. But there is just. As a result, there is
  only a small audience, so.'
- 'Me: Is it difficult to market? Isn''t it? Because the people that are going to
  stay there aren''t the people searching on the Internet for it, are. They.'
- 'Them: No. And that''s why they went with those American pool. Specially salespeople.
  But that just didn''t work. But I don''t know about. Cuz they got. They chose the
  wrong people. I don''t know. So we''ll see. We''ll see anyway.'
- 'Me: Just the. The thing on Google. And pmax.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: God.'
- 'Them: How annoying.'
- 'Me: It was a conversation with him. I can send you a full transcript if you want,
  but I. He''s offered to have a discussion. I think at the end of the day, got to
  think about what do we want to get out of it. What we want to get out is we like
  those back on again. They are not going back on again.'
- 'Them: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Me: Categorically they are not going to do it.'
- 'Them: Sorry. Did they say why? Like.'
- 'Me: What they said was it was. It was a technical thing that needed to go to the
  engineers. The technical team only have a certain amount of time to deal with things
  such as this. And the amount of spend that we were put into them wasn''t sufficient
  to warrant that there were other people in the queue. So we would never be prioritized
  sufficiently in terms of spend for them to. To. To do something about it. And of
  I actually asked him for an email to set to explain this and he refused. Says that''s
  not Google policy to do that. So it was in absence a seriously was a brick wall.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: If you want to go on a call and get incredibly frustrated with somebody, then.
  Then.'
- 'Them: I don''t even have time to be honest, but I mean.'
- 'Me: Exactly. Yeah. You know, I. I''ve done all I can with it. I couldn''t. I can''t.
  The only. The only thing we can. We can possibly do now is to. To go to the booking
  engine to see when they''re going to do it.'
- 'Them: That''s fine. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So that we that would be done quicker than Google would do it.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So.'
- 'Them: Okay? Sorry. My ignorance on that specifically. What do we need one journey
  to do?'
- 'Me: They need to there. Is like.'
- 'Them: Give them a list. Garry got a few things on there for One Journey to do.
  I know that''s that, that and sort of that''s my point is trying to. I don''t know
  which is harder, Google or One Journey.'
- 'Me: There is a sort of like a back end management system that one journey need
  to be part of, they need to subscribe to it and they need to add the properties
  to it.'
- 'Them: So it''s still. It''s still back to that original problem.'
- 'Me: Yep. Now the other three properties. Notice what really worries me. We''re
  counting out hanging on by a thread. Because if Google decides to delete Those landing
  page URLs from those, there''s also nothing we can do about that either.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Is the. Do you think the booking by having one journey is the booking
  engine? Is. A big issue. Like, is that one of the biggest issues? They are like,
  the integration itself is poor. And they''re actually from a paid point of view.
  Having a different booking engine. Is preferable.'
- 'Me: Only from that perspective.'
- 'Them: Only for the PMAX perspective. It''s if, if, if the other booking engines,
  but I wouldn''t guarantee the other book managers are that.'
- 'Me: Only for that.'
- 'Them: It would be a question you and said you know of any others.'
- 'Me: It''s a simple. It''s a simple question to ask of the booking engine, you know?
  Do you allow integration into pmax? Can you prove it?'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. I absolutely guarantee you guest line won''t as an example. But
  they''re even smaller than like one journey is the thing is one''s own is a pretty
  big. I mean, like, the. The thing that''s maybe confusing is because I, to be honest,
  didn''t realize this until that long ago is that we still operate through guestline.
  But. One journey. Is the skin, the booking skin. That we use. So Guest line can
  actually offer different integrations and we are still connected to Guestline.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: I didn''t know that. Owner. Did not. Because I didn''t either until, like,
  quite recently. Because I was looking at connecting with a. Like, setting up a new
  contract with I Escapes. And they were like, oh, yeah, did you have integration?
  And I was like, oh, well, I don''t know. We''re with one journey. And they were
  like, oh, no, we don''t integrate with one journey. And then they list still the
  others. And so I pushed that back, passed on to Lena, and I was like, lena, which
  ones could we do as an alternative? And she''s like, oh, no, we can do it through
  guest line, because guest line is still our. I guess, yeah.'
- 'Me: So there the backend system. One journey of engine layer above that.'
- 'Them: And then one journey is like the skin, yeah.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: The booking skin.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: Okay? But that''s. That''s interesting. I mean, guest line''s not very good
  either. I mean, there''s no getting away from the guest. Guest line. What, you moved
  off them because they were rubbish. But we offer. We are. We are, for certain. And
  it''s still. It still runs, you know? Runs the high, doesn''t it? Yeah, on exclusively.
  But then everything else actually still is line. I think we could probably.'
- 'Me: Budget for the high through a PMAX campaign as well.'
- 'Them: That''s it. If we have a connection through a guest line instead. Which I
  wonder whether it''s feasible.'
- 'Me: Can I. Can I make a suggestion?'
- 'Them: Sure.'
- 'Me: If I get. If I ask google. To say, what do we need? What do we need to get
  our booking engine to do? What do they need to connect to? How do they need to do
  it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, because we might have connections that we can use. Like, I know there''s
  one through. I think it''s called Star. S T, A. A H is another. Like is an integration
  that can be used. This is all new to me. So that would be. That would be worthwhile
  because we can throw that a guest. Line and we could throw that guest line on one
  journey and see what they say, yeah.'
- 'Me: Right. I can guarantee a quick response from our Google rep on that one. Because
  at least it''s in her hands.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It''s an easy one, isn''t it? It''s. It''s. It''s worth
  the conversation. I mean, you know my issue with one journey. Is is not just obviously
  the P Max is a big problem, but I just think generally it''s the same as the rest
  of the site. It seems to be. We''ve added. We basically made the book in Journey
  longer than it used to be. Because there''s more options in there. So this is what
  I got back. I just copy. I''m just throwing stuff into this chat. There are pyramids,
  property management, journeys. Just looking at abs guest line. So the. Yeah, but
  it''s still. I. I think it''s. I know.'
- 'Me: There''s a whole new load of words in there that she don''t want.'
- 'Them: And this is all new for me, so I''m just like, okay. I still think it''s.
  Can we run it on. I think it''s one journey. You still have to. Because one journey
  is the. It''s the com. The confirmation page is controlled. Yeah. Yeah, I. Yeah,
  it might do. It''s. What? It''s certainly worth trying. It''s certainly worth trying.
  Okay?'
- 'Me: It''s interesting, though, isn''t it? Because the. The. If you think of the
  tracking journey. Going to one journey. First you have to pass the. The tracking
  through to them. And then if it''s the. The checkout itself, Is with guest line
  that''s also got to be passed through and then pass back up the chain to Google
  Ads to say it''s actually converted. That is complicated. Okay, I will. I''ll ask
  the question. And then at least it can be passed on. You know, they''re technical.
  They will understand this. They probably look at and go, yeah, we know that. I know
  we''re not going to do it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Or. Oh, yeah, we do do that already. May. Maybe we. Maybe it''s the wrong question
  that''s been asked. I don''t know.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Maybe.'
- 'Me: But it''s certainly not going to happen from Google anyway.'
- 'Them: Okay? Great stuff.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: All right. All right. So I finalize the actions that you both there, but
  thank you for.'
- 'Me: There''s a dent in the wall here.'
- 'Them: Getting the report. I get the report over later.'
- 'Me: No worries.'
- 'Them: Thanks.'
- 'Me: Wonderful.'
- 'Them: That''d be great. I mean, I know you''re still fiddling with some bits, aren''t
  you, Peter? But just once you''ve got those. That conversion rate.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I think. I think as a dynamic process, I''m just going to get the. The.'
- 'Them: So right there is. That''s all good.'
- 'Me: Okie doke.'
- 'Them: Okay, thanks so much. Both speak to.'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Them: Hello.
- Me: Hello. There.
- Them: Good.
- Me: I think I got the wrong day after all that. I was beginning to think I got the wrong day. Then after all that. Sorry. I've just been sat here for a while, just staring out the window. Just time overtook me.
- Them: How are you doing? How you feeling?
- Me: Yes. Apologies for the other day. I've had the perfect storm over the last few days. With hospital points with my sister. Doctor strikes, changed appointments, and then Claude crashed on me over the weekend, so I've spent all weekend working, so it's not been great. But anyway.
- Them: Good.
- Me: We're here.
- Them: Nearly christmas.
- Me: Yes, absolutely. You know what? I absolutely hate this time of year I have done for last 15, 20 years. I just absolutely hate it.
- Them: Oh, God.
- Me: Black Friday Christmas rubbish. Marketing. It's crazy. There's so much commerce is done in such a short space of time.
- Them: Yeah. See that? Intense, isn't it?
- Me: Just ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: My wife and I are going to go and work at the nursing home this weekend. This Christmas, rather than actually have a Christmas dinner.
- Them: I feel like the same. Oh, yay. That's nice.
- Me: Kick him back. Well, hopefully we'll be, as long as they don't dribble too much.
- Them: That's a nice thing to do, though. I often think that sometimes nicest to do something.
- Me: Wow. We also limit ourselves to 10 pound each for Christmas presents.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So that is really difficult. Really.
- Them: Wow. I struggle to do a Secret Santa press up for £10. Yeah, can like, what do you even get a mug?
- Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'll give you a shortcut chat. GPT does not help at all.
- Them: I'll tell you what it does help with. I. This is when the world has moved on. My. I'm helping my mum understand stuff to do with pensions at the moment to deal with. My. My dad passed away and as a result, we are. We are. I'm trying to work out what she's. Due and I've spent an hour with chat GPT and. And now it's even drafted an official letter to go back to the Department of Wages and Pensions to explain what she's entitled to. It's just mine. I spoke to at my pension guy and he basically said, I don't know. That area that well.
- Me: Brilliant.
- Them: He goes, but I'm pretty confident if you. I'll read it for you. And I get. He went, did you write this? I went, no, that's amazing.
- Me: Nice.
- Them: Wow. So there you go. It can be a force for good. It can be a force for good.
- Me: Nice.
- Them: It can. It can.
- Me: Well, on. On Sunday, I came across an 8. By Saturday, I came across an issue.
- Them: So.
- Me: And it turns out there's something wrong with Claude. I spent six hours thinking it was me. It was actually Claude that was wrong.
- Them: Who. Who would. Who would. Who would believe it?
- Me: I know. Well, you don't, do you? And so you always suspect yourself rather than the AI.
- Them: That. And that. And that is the danger, because at the end of the day, rubbish. Uni's rubbish out, I'm afraid. So if it gets hold of misleading articles, wrong information, then it's only going to spuriously come back to you. But anyway.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Anyway.
- Me: Apologies. I've started off with the right old moan. Do you want me to start again? Come back on again?
- Them: You know what? I feel like there's something in the. In the air lately. I feel like everyone I speak to, it's quite, like, somber.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Like. Felt like you need to get some energy in.
- Me: I'll try and g up a little bit with these.
- Them: It's positivity. You've gone. You've gone for the. Your jumpers. Almost Christmassy, but. And quite bright, can I say? Yeah, we've gone for orange today. You've made a real bet.
- Me: Figures. Yeah, absolutely. We've disgun figure a Garry.
- Them: Yeah, sorry. Yeah. It's pretty good. I did have a Christmas. I did have a Christmas jumper on yesterday. It was a red one. So, you know. Yeah, Sorry. Sorry. I should have kept that going today, but there you go, right? Remind me, do you share or do I share Green Pete?
- Me: I will share with you.
- Them: Cool. I'll let you do. That.
- Me: Tada. So one of the issues I've had over the weekend is it just trashed this report. Before I could actually do finish it off. So I've been redoing this. So apologies if there's any glaring mistakes in this. I've literally been doing this up to five minutes ago, just tightening it up a little bit. So all good, really. So we reduced the spend in accordance with the budget last.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Month. That's produced a drop in revenue, but not in proportion to the spend. Which was quite nice. The thing that's making a real difference at the moment is reviewing this during the month to see what hotels are working, which ones aren't. I think the danger is not to do it too much. I'm trying to give each property a decent percentage of the spend.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But I think we talked about this last time, but at the end of the day, I feel as though it's been judged on roas more than anything else, rather than the number of bookings we're getting for the individual hotels.
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: But in some respects it has to do. Some of the hotels are more responsive to Google Ads than others. So many specs going for low hanging fruits. We're fishing where the fish are. But I just want to flag it really, that I don't just want to be chasing roas. Otherwise we're going to end up just spending money on the Devonshire.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because.
- Them: I'm debon charms. Yeah, because that was. That one does do well, doesn't it? So what would you. What's your alternative?
- Me: Well, it's just been aware of it. We could say, well, what percentage, what percentage of the spend do you want to spend on each hotel? And we optimize each one of them towards that. Towards that spend, you know, what is the expectation of the business for each property? And it's a big one to say, well, what do you expect to get out of Google Ads for each property? Nobody knows really, do they, until you actually do it. We have sufficient data in here. And I think when I'm making suggestions to you as far as budget changes are concerned,
- Them: No.
- Me: I'm conscious of. Trying to give all of them the benefit of the doubt, but also pushing it towards the ones that are going to give us the bookings. We start off the month with a proportion for each one of them.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's not helped, the PMAX thing, that we're now two down on pmax and you can't allocate individual budgets to individual hotels within pmax. You just give it a budget and it goes and spends it on the most lucrative of those. I don't really have an answer for. You really?
- Them: Yeah. I think. I think we need.
- Me: Because it is mixed up with what the business wants.
- Them: A. I think we've got to have a minimum. I don't know what that is, but I think, like, we've got to have a minimum because I want you, right? We can't get into a situation. It's just we spend all the money on the two best hotels.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Because. Because otherwise we're not. We're not helping the other hotels. You do that for about two months and then suddenly you get the business shouting going. The fell. Struggling, really struggling. What we doing to help them type of thing.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. And that could be responsive to that. You know, if there is a seasonal drop for a hotel, and I could always increase the budget if it seemed to be a separate marketing span for that.
- Them: But you, as you say, it's. I mean, it's so intent driven, though, isn't it? So, like, you know, I can't. We can't magic conversions if they're not, you know, if the market isn't there to do it. So I feel like, you know, it is a bit. Of a. A mixture in terms of that strategy because, you know, we'll take your expertise and your guidance in terms of where that budget is best, then. You know, with the expectation that ultimately we're looking for more sales. So wherever that needs to be is where it needs to be. And then that's the conversation I can have this side. And just to manage expectations, to say, look, you know, based on however long we've been running these campaigns, Devon's performance really well on paid search and on performance, Max fell less. So we therefore recommend we have. Do you know what I mean? Like, that's the kind of story that can say,
- Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's why I have in my mind's eye when I'm doing it. Yeah, definitely. You know, if it says if. If the. If the budget looks like. Or we should be spending two quid on the Bailey, I'm gonna go, no, we can't actually do that. A reasonable amount in. There.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So I'm. I'm just. I'm just. I'm flagging it, really, just to, you know, say I. I don't want to get to that point. And there will be allowances if I, you know, I'm coming back saying 745roas would be, you know, that's. Fantastic. Well, yeah, I could probably get that higher than that if we just went. If we just went for the. For the. The Devonshire.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But.
- Them: Am I right in thinking that last month when we, you know, did that. And so we had a really good roas. For Devon trams, and then we upped the budgets, but it didn't necessarily convert the same rate as maybe we were expecting that.
- Me: Yeah. Overall, the budget. The, the. The extra money we put into it gave us an increase in budget in roas. Overall.
- Them: Yeah, okay.
- Me: So it did have an effect. It's, it's. It's difficult to be granular on that because halfway through the month, the budget had to come down anyway.
- Them: Okay? Okay?
- Me: Because it was running well at the beginning of the month, we were going to overspend on the. On the main budget. So it's not as though I'm just looking at the budget and saying, let's split it into, into 30 parts and that's how much it's going to spend every day. Because we came down from. Well, there was a, what, 21% drop in spend last month. So that has to be brought down gradually. I can't just say on the, on the last day of the month, right, next tomorrow it's going to be that much, because it really would upset the apple cart. So it's a, it's a bit of a moving target, but overall, it did improve the rug. Well, you can see from that, you know, 22% of month on month.
- Them: It. Always starts in the. Yeah. Y. Eah.
- Me: It's. It's. It's improved the roas. It had the positive effect on it.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Okay? So the individual hotel performance. So, again, I've. I've consolidated these together from the search and from the pmax.
- Them: It's just.
- Me: The usual. The usual suspects. I mean, the Bailey's done really well this month. Is there a specific reason for that, do you think, or not?
- Them: The pretty question. No, not really. Not really? Not been running in particular.
- Me: Okay? Okay, and then. So Devon Shire and then Chatsworth. The Fell was the underperformer, along with the Pilsley. They were both below target. Again, I, I have no reason for, for, for a technical viewpoint why that would be the case. But they've, they've not done particularly well this month. Was it last month that fell weren't doing very well as well?
- Them: The fellas haven't done well all year, so. But there's quite a bit in the SEO report as well around that as well.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Okay, good. Because I think like the and this is actually part of separate note that, Garry, just our conversation around that stay and dine package and all that tracking. So one of the things that I'm being pushed on is putting more budget behind some social advertising specifically for staying down. But currently I'm struggling to understand a roas because I don't know whether it's going to hurting on that package or something else. So that's kind of like a bit of an area as well in itself is that, you know, from my perspective, Richard is saying, yeah, you know, we need to spend the money, let's spend the money, like, you know, if. Let's put it against what's working. But for the fell, I feel like we're not really seeing great performance on ppc, and I don't really know why. Like, so it's hard to then go back and say, right, okay. You know. Yeah. Let's budget. Well, there's two things I'd say. One, in terms of the I've got to find out if it's even possible to get that data. It might not be, and I don't know if we can even associate it to a campaign because the report you looking at. Even if there was data in there, wouldn't associate it to an individual campaign that way. We'll have to think about that separately, but I'm sure it can be done. But I don't. Not within the current parameters. Okay, but. But in terms of just. Is the offer being taken up?
- Me: Off the. Big take.
- Them: The date. The data that Lena sent us I can use. That definitely is. There's. There's loads. There's plenty of proof in there that I think the office working. Whether or not it's coming via social, I couldn't tell you. In terms of the. In terms of the fell demand. There is a mass like and this. And to your point earlier. If the demand isn't there, there is little. I was saying to the guys that as the G earlier this week, they were like, what? What? You know, they. They were looking at me, and they desperately didn't want to say this because they'd hate saying it, but I. I said it for them. There isn't anything they can do because you can't magically make people demand looking for the Fed. Yeah. You can improve the non brand stuff, which is what they've done, and that's, that's all gone up. Yeah. But, yeah, the brand is down, and. And this is. I'm trying to think of the nicest ones I can say this to you, and I'm struggling to say how to say it to Rachel. The whole brand thing is struggling since the rebrand.
- Me: S.
- Them: Because the Devon shirt was a respected, well known brand.
- Me: The. Champion wasn't.
- Them: And you can see it like I. Because I did a bit of a review of your Google business profile for the high because we were just checking some data. There's a lot of you can see. I don't think even I realized how respected Chatsworth and Devonshire brands were. Because you've seen it, because you were there. And you told me a couple of anecdotal stories. But there's a lot of people going under the premise of this. Is now the Devonshire. This is now the Chatsworth. And it's not the level they were expecting. Which then means people now that the dev. Now, the fell isn't the Devonshire fell. It's. It's lost a lot of momentum. Yeah. Devon sharms. Well, because it still says Devonshire.
- Me: Expect. Ing.
- Them: Because I think, like, and it may be that come through in the SEO report and it's the stuff that I would look, if I had more know, I would say if I had more time, if I had more time to dig into some of this, like, it would make it so much easier. So if you do have any of that sort of data to show pre post rebrand and the impact that's having like that would be so helpful. Just because I'm struggling, because obviously I've joined, rebranded, done, or it's underway, and I'm like, you know, implementing what's already been, you know, well underway. So I'm now having to try and work out what we do with the fel with, you know, and essentially it is start. Again, like, you know, in terms of how can we launch the Fell as a. As its own thing. It needs positioning, it needs everything. But obviously, in this interim period, We still need to make money. So that's where we're being pushed for, you know. I say we, so I'm being pushed for, you know? If that package is working, let's push that package. If this, you know, can we put more ppc? What can we do? Like, it's. That's the push back. I'm going. I think the two obvious things to do are we've got loads of data already on the lack of the brand. Terms being used now, so we can put that in into it. But also it's probably worth looking at just visitor numbers.
- Me: Today.
- Them: For the old site under the fell and the new site, and just seeing it's. It's exposure, because there's two sides of it, is, oh, we get enough people. Look, are we getting enough people from marketing point of view and are we getting the conversion and. They're two different things. It may be. Both. It may be one, it may be the other, I don't know. So I'll have a look. So many plain, so many like moving parts as part of it isn't there because like with a relaunch, with a new site that has a knock on effect, it's like it's at this point now where we know six months in, just being able to start thinking right, okay, what can we attribute to the loss here? Like, where is this? What's the source? So that's the bit that, you know, needs to be revisited. And I'm conscious to not be the. You know, I'm. I am a bit like, I think you are as well, a data person at heart. Yeah, yeah. So, so, you know, and I used to own a user experience company, so I, I understand that, but, you know, I'm, I'm very conscious of that. I am probably not the brand person. And the problem is, too, it's too easy for me to say, I don't think the user experience is as good on the news site because I don't. It isn't best practice and I, and I think it's too brand led and less data led. But, but, but we both know going back to the business and just saying that without evidence is, Is true. Yeah. And. And, and I am a supplier with Pete. It's your job, so I don't want to get you in trouble. No, exactly. Yeah. Okay. All right. Anyway, yeah, that would be. That would be great. Thank you, Garry.
- Me: And this isn't the level of detail that you want. I actually did this brand versus non brand analysis on the, on the PPC campaigns.
- Them: O.
- Me: For, for the last 30 days. And I mean it's, it speaks for itself really. When you look at the click through rates on the, on the top right of brand versus on brand and the roas is, and it's like.
- Them: H. Yeah. Okay, great.
- Me: It's kind of obvious, but as you say, we're data driven. That is the data. Now, the caveat to this is that as far as Brand is concerned, we've got Bee, Lee and Pilsley in there, which aren't necessarily Brand, but at least surfacing those that we would deem to be brand, which is the calm edition and the damage. And you can see. Yeah, you can see them. It's a. It's a massive brand. The Devonshire Arms is just a huge brand, isn't it? You can see Bolton Abbey as well, how big that is. There'll be small, smaller numbers on. There. But again, we're back to fishing where the fish are. You know, when we took off the. The negative keyword for the Devon share, all of a sudden, whoosh, up it goes, and there is the. We don't want to be cannibalizing it. But we, you know, we've. We've had this discussion before about occupying real estate on the, on the search page on Google, which is, which is what we've got to do, really.
- Them: And the truth is, that's only getting worse. It's getting harder for. For organic to get at the top of the page. We might be the top. We are generally the top three or four ranked listings for Devon Girms, but that doesn't always get you in the top half of someone's screen.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: So.
- Me: Anyway. Back to where I was. Just met you, Desi, for a minute.
- Them: Make it so hard for us, don't they?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So you spend more money with them. It's pay to play territory now, isn't it?
- Me: I mean, you look at people like Amazon. It's been like that for years. It's just creeping into everything, isn't it? I. I was. I was reading something today about.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Is it? Something like $210 billion is going to be transacted through as a result of chat GPT this year on Christmas shopping. It's just an enormous amount. Absolutely enormous. And that is just with people playing with it. You know. Oh, I did this the other day. It'll soon become. Well, it's the same as I've always done on Google. It wouldn't be a. A great thing. So. I've got a. There's an issue with November's figures. On this. On this chart, not with the ones that we've just been looking. We're doing the year on year figures. This. I don't. When did you start, Helen? Right. Okay, so last year we had an issue with the conversion tracking.
- Them: Breathe.
- Me: In that the Highwayman conversion tracking was on. On some. On the. The hotel pages. As. As a result of that, it was showing that there was something like 1, 700 conversions for November. So there was two separate conversion options. So that's skewing the figures. So it's when you see the conversion. Rate and conversion percentage change on here is not necessarily correct.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: I am working on that. That's what I was doing 15 minutes ago, so apologies for that. I'm still working my way through it. The. The figures. The. The figures are. Are looking good on there, anyway. It's not going to make a huge amount.
- Them: We're at the anniversary, aren't we? That would. It was November was when it launched, so.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So you can see the conversion rate on that one. The absolutes. That's clearly not correct. The rest of the figures are fine. Conversions, roas cost and so on. And conversion value.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Is literally just that conversion rate. So the news is, the news is good year on year.
- Them: Okay, great.
- Me: We're still tracking in the right direction. I just did a quick. Analysis on year. On year. So. Oh, it's just going to be one of those days. There. Would you excuse me just for one minute? The dog's just arrived, panting like mad, and there's going to be a puddle on the floor if I don't let him out.
- Them: No worries.
- Me: So posies for this. Just one sec.
- Them: Okay? Great. Well. Where are the. Where are the other priorities? Is it. Is the fell the big. Is it still that one or any other? Like it just feels very difficult currently. We have a look at the revenue report now that you know. Lena came through yesterday, and she said they were, like, barely any sales. Over the weekend. Wow. Yeah.
- Me: When you get to a certain age, when you've got to go, you've got to go. And he's up that certain age, the dog.
- Them: I was trying to distract Helen by talking about stuff. But now I've depressed her because I made a look at revenue report.
- Me: Without a president.
- Them: Yeah. I've made a look at revenue reports on. Apparently they're not good, so it's. It's okay. Right. December. Looking pretty empty next week. Very empty. January. Yeah, really, like, loads and loads of rooms still. But then, equally, we haven't launched our new, like, packages, so we're just finalizing. Or packages for next year, so. Or next quarter at least. So we're going to do like a nine on us kind of situation where we across all the group, we have lunch or dinner included. Or you get it for free, basically, as part of that price. It's not like a would be really mindful how we phrase it, because it doesn't sound like it's just a. A rate that we offer for, you know, better breakfast or, you know, dinner, bed and breakfast. It is free. Like the actual but we can't say free because it's not on brand.
- Me: Complimentary.
- Them: So I don't envy you at times. I know. So that's the package that we're launching across everything next quarter, but that will run from January through to March. Cottages. We're going in with quite an aggressive rate. In January, we're going to be, like, discounting 20% pretty much on most. Across the group. Just TBC on a few things on that. And then we'll have some dining offers which are, like, local. So we'll do. We're doing like a restaurant tour kind of stamp initiative, where you have to visit every single property, spend 50 quid and then you'll get 50 quid free on. Your fourth visit and entry into a prize draw for a free. Stay over somewhere. Mowgli are doing that. That's the Mowgli. Oh. Could you send me a photo there? Create it. Yeah, it's. It's like credit. Yes. It's a passport.
- Me: That's a great idea.
- Them: Ah, okay, cool. We're doing, like, a little. We're going to do a stamp, so actually, you can go in your wallet. Better. I think best chance of me, less chance of me forgetting to take it. Anyway, I'm doing that now. Yeah. Thank you. So, yeah, so it's kind of. We haven't launched those yet, so we've got the revenue call tomorrow to go through kind of any more outstanding things. I imagine it will be quite. Push, push, push. To get stuff through. So we're just in the middle of getting landing pages all sorted, but sell continues to be problem as to cottages, but obviously. I know we've had separate chat about that. Have you always. I know. Sorry. You might come onto this, Pete, but have you reverted the ad to the old landing page now for cottages? Yeah. Amazing. Thank you. So, yeah, I fed back that that landing page. Kind of a B test hasn't really worked and we need to revisit. Actually thinking about proper build and. Redesigning it. And I think Richard and Rachel may be quite surprised if they thought the original design was based on Airbnb. So they're quite surprised. It's not working, but it's not based on Airbnb. Yeah. So I was like, well, we just. It's not converting, so we need. To do something about it. We will. Our maps team is looking at building as a new map, but I just kind of feel like rather than everything work in silos, this needs to be one big conversation around engagement conversion rate what we want.
- Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: And then work backwards rather than now. Maps team go work in isolation and build our map and us think about what they need to look like. I do know what I mean. I just would rather it all be one big project. So the plan is maybe as an interim do something like that's ok, we'll continue. Working on that as a project and actually have that mapped out. I'll speak to you separately, Garry, on what we want to do. But the other thing is, what we have seen has worked well, is we have a campaign called River Y25 for our upper Dale. Cottage collection, and that's 25% off. That's been running a while. Like, a while now. And I set that up as a separate package. On our website. And I think. And that's worked really well, and obviously it's discounted, so that's worked well. But they had some amazing kind of like, conversion off the back of that. And I think it was all to do with the fact that it was one landing page. Here are the cottages. Like, and it was just simple. And then they, you know, you click through to individual landing pages to see more about the cottage. But actually, that booking and everything was just easy because it was just built as one package, so that might be the interim that we then moved to. So we have kind of a separate. We have a page that is like chat. Go back to the collections pre me, but it was like Chatsworth collection. Up a Dale collection. Ball, Cross, Heath, Lee. And then maybe that might make things a bit clearer. Let's see for now. That could be the interim.
- Me: It was interesting from those stats though, to see the percentage of people looking because it was interesting. Watch your hands as well, because you talking about that. But it's actually like that, isn't it? You know, it's the. It's mobile, and it. It made such a huge difference doing those screenshots. To see what they actually look like to someone who was searching.
- Them: Yeah, they just caught. There's too much image. There's two bigger image at the top, isn't it?
- Me: Well, even the corner. The callers on the bottom right hand corner covered a huge amount of space. It didn't look proportional to mobile look the same size as it would have done on desktop, not occupying a huge amount of space. And that had it. That's going to have an effect.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So it's. It's almost. They obviously are doing this, but it, you know, like, designed for mobile. Rather than having that idea of having the cottage in that side and the. And the map on that say, well, how does that actually look? When you get on mobile.
- Them: Nothing on that site was designed for mobile, I'm afraid. No, it really wasn't. It was designed. It was designed for Brand. That's what will happen then, Garry. Obviously, I wasn't here then. Do you think that was. Yeah.
- Me: Oh, wow.
- Them: Seong pointed it out. I pointed it out. And at the time. Yeah. And it was. We, we were just like, it's not as mobile friendly as. As we'd like it to be. But of course, the problem is SEO. G's remit is more around SEO. And so they, they know, they know ui. I know, I know ux. So we, you know, the truth is, you. Know, a year ago, we came up with a design for a new cottages page, which was pretty much just land and see all the cottages and have some really cool filters at the top. And that's all it was. Yeah. And then it got. It got stopped because I said, we're going to redesign the entire site. Which made sense. There's no point, because it would have been, you know, not a quick project. But the truth is, that was then. You know, it. It's again, as Pete said. It starts with a big, beautiful image. I know. Nobody needs a big, beautiful image. I've gone. This is a landing page for people who've gone. I want to look at cottages. So show me some cottages. I don't even. I get the idea of the redesign, the map, the. The thing you showed us does look much better. But with the greatest respect, the people who are looking for it aren't looking for where am I exactly on this map? They just want to see what the patterns look like, isn't it? I think that comes later in the journey. Oh, hang on, where is it positioned in like, in relation to things I want to. Be doing while I'm there? Because it's all in the same area. It's not like it's. It's. It's not like it's a UK wide map. I know.
- Me: It's another term.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. When you know this, you know this. I know. Okay, we'll put. We'll pick it up separately. Yes. People will keep it moving, though. I will. The agenda.
- Me: Also good news.
- Them: I'd love that, actually.
- Me: Revenue growth up 92% year on year, so conversion up 62%.
- Them: Cheer us up.
- Me: ROAS has improved from 4.3 to 6.38. This is comparing four years. And the revenue conversion. This is. This might just be inflation, but it's gone up from 4:30 to 5:11.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So, yeah, September peak. And the nice thing, I suppose for us is that we're, we're 7.5% average ROAS for Q3. So it's all that work that we did in in earlier on in the year is, is actually paying off now and just that around a budget, so.
- Them: Yeah. That is good. The only thing I would say is it's just being able to paint a picture, obviously, because we have increased spend. If you look like year on year,
- Me: That's the roas. So we increased roas 48.
- Them: Yeah. That's my thing. That's the rows going up when we've increased the spend is. That's, that's the bit that I'm. Because otherwise, you know, those figures are great. But then the answer is always, ever. We spent more money, so you'd hope so. Like. So as long as we can make that, we're happy with that, Roas figure that's something I can take away and be like, look, what a win. You know, we've been a really efficient with budget. And then again, that just opens up the door of being able to say, look, we need to spend because this is our untapped potential. You know, here's what we could be doing, and then back to our original chat right at the beginning. And here's where we, you know, we know it's working. Let's put more behind that, and then we can go from there.
- Me: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm not going to continue to do that with a, you know, contacting you in the month just to say there is, there are all limited by budget at the moment.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But it was really. It's a case. This first week is letting it all settle down after the, the, the big drop in budget. So the roas might be because we've reduced budget and it's having to work harder. So I just have to make sure that there is actually potential there. And these strategic, you know, just for a couple of weeks. Increasing budget aren't the most efficient way of doing things, but they do actually pay off. So just got to. Just got to be careful with it. It's very easy to say you can go and spend an extra 200 pound a month, about a day if you wanted to, and you're going to get more money, but I can't categorically say that right now, today.
- Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. But then I'm now going to go back to the beginning again anyway, so maybe we need to think about what that base rate needs to be.
- Me: Yeah, yeah. The base rate for roas.
- Them: No, in terms of spend, so that it doesn't feel like such a big jump.
- Me: Yeah. Yes.
- Them: Back down again.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. It's. It's the. The. The tricky one when that is, with it being seasonal, isn't it? You know, we're going to be chucking more money at it. So the. I mean, the. The market is spending the way is at the moment. At least I've got something to aim at. And I can, you know, towards the end of one month, when I know it's going to go down, I can actually start to scale it down towards the end of a month. Why we ended up with a little bit more the end of the month.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. So I'm going to be intrigued to see because obviously I'll be here a full year. From end of February, but I just. I'll be intrigued to see what January is like because. You know, is the demand going to be there, like, based on, you know, appetite to spend?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Or do people want to? I don't know. It's a hard, you know, hard industry to. Know what the.
- Me: They all are this year. Is that It's. Is that financial insecurity? You know, I've not. Friday has not been brilliant.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It certainly hasn't been the huge thing. It normally is as huge, but then again, some people are saying it's great.
- Them: Yeah. Could we see actually over. Over time? What would be handy is even if. I don't know if there's a category thing or whether it's a. But just to see that volume over time, just so that we're able to see, like, search volume over time.
- Me: But not what I'm. Doing impressions. Okay? It? Well, it's going to be directly proportional to spend.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, if you know about might not work.
- Me: You know?
- Them: Then.
- Me: Well, we'll get that kick back again. The thing that's happened this year, of course, is CPCs have gone up as well, so you can't necessarily match.
- Them: No.
- Me: The two of them, I mean. CPCS is going to be down to clicks, Impressions is going to be down to visibility, but also what our targets are. I'm trying to maintain the target ROAS that we aim for to 5, 70%.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: I don't want to move that around too much because that really does throw all the. All the toys out the pram.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's fine, actually. That's another just being mean to know about CPTs going up. That's another thing. That would be good.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Again just to highlight, because if it's again that Roas picture, really strong year on year. Despite increasing cpc. Do you know what I mean? Like, just some of that messaging is quite handy for me to, like, relay back.
- Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no problem. I mean, the, the CPCs across the board in Google Ads have gone up quite dramatically recently because of the introduction of pmax. It used to be that if you wanted to bid on someone else's brand, that you would put a search campaign out there with their, their keywords in the. In the. The. The search campaign.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Now, you just put a PMAX campaign out there and it'll do it for you anyway.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
- Me: So it's just whether you like it or not. So that's then pushed up the competition for the, for the, the brand. So it's also about impression share as well. You know, where do we, where do we sit?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Me: Are we? I'll we. Are we catering for the same amount of people as we were originally in terms of the size of the market? So I could do. I could do some impression, share stuff.
- Them: Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank. Yeah.
- Me: Okay? Okay, no worries.
- Them: Thank you.
- Me: I'm flicking over these because I'm just reading these, these bullet points as we're, as you're looking at the, at the graph, so they're all there afterwards if you need to see them. So that's, that's just the profitability. It doesn't necessarily give the full picture because it's down to volume. The nice thing with the Devonshire is it's getting a high roas and it's getting a. A decent level of. Level of bookings, whereas the. The Beely is more restricted on bookings. But, yeah, it smashed it out of the part this month.
- Them: Right. Thank you.
- Me: Okay, so the locations. Not a huge amount to report on that because the Bolton Abbey Escape location has been. Has been stopped. Because after our discussion. So that was reallocated that the money that was going on there. So the hide. This is. This has been pretty good. I'm pleased with this.
- Them: Okay, good. Good.
- Me: Well, 427, 423, and it's really the first full month.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: So the algorithm is. Is now learning. Or has lurched, let's say. So we're, we're seeing that, that improvement. So 20 bookings. I mean, click through rate is fantastic. 20.9. That's, that's better than some of the core properties. So it's, it's heading the right way. I mean, we, we're still on a 2,000 pound budget. I went slightly over last month, so it's under £3 over, so I'll try and pull that. Back this month.
- Them: Yeah. That's all right.
- Me: So.
- Them: I know I'm asking a lot. Sorry. I know I'm asking a lot, but just only click through rate then. And you said, oh, no, that's a great click through rate. Again. It'd be really good if we could just establish, like, what's an all right, click through rate, and then so we know what above averages. So it just makes it a bit easier again, so I can say, oh, yeah, like click through rates. Because it's just that. So what kind of conversation that I then rely.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Them: So I think you know how we defining. What good is so that I can say, yeah, we smashed out the part because our average click through rate is 15% but hide is 20. Do you know what I mean?
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, well, this is going to be easier when I. When I put all this onto the same table.
- Them: It's. Just some of that storytelling. On the same table. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
- Me: Yeah. So I've kept it off for now because this is the first month.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That it's been on its own. That It's. It's been fully running for a month. So the campaign. I'll put the hide with the others.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Next month. So I'm reporting the whole lot in at the same thing. But I'll also keep things like this graph going.
- Them: Yeah. Great. Yes. Yeah, great.
- Me: So that you can see. So. So when you say about ctr, that's, that's giving you the.
- Them: Yeah. There we go. That's much easier to see.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Impressions is going to go up because you're spending more anyway. But, you know, the CTR is, is extraordinary.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Compared to last month and then compared to. I mean, I don't know about. Over in January over here. Is this a seasonal thing? We don't. We don't really know yet. Whether it is or it isn't. But I'll keep this one going and I'll put the. I'll put the hide on with the others.
- Them: Great. Thank you. I. I would. What I would suggest is that in January the click through rate was unusually high for across the the board.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Like, if I look. If I look back to last year for all the hotels, for January, for all the hotels, it was. It was very high. So I. So I think January is just a little bit of a freak month. I. I think you look the. The core part of the year is where most things are and that and. It pitches it. You know? The rest of the hotels rarely get. You know, their average is less than 10%, so.
- Me: It'll be interesting to see how that Ctr Murray is up against conversion rate as well. Is it just browsers in January.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, is it. The dream is just, you know, sat there after with a hangover on. On New Year's Day, actually looking at. Looking at where they can't go, where they can't afford to go. Who knows? It just come into your mind then? You were talking before about packages and so on. It'd. Be really good to know what they are. And put some of these on site links on the on the.
- Them: Yeah. Yes. I think you have staying down on there already for the foul because I think I must have mentioned that about a million times, but I'll stay in time. God.
- Me: That was. Even if they're individual ones and there's a. There's a time limit on them, I can always put that on. If it just increases the ctr, then. Then even better.
- Them: Yeah, that's fine. Great.
- Me: So this is the self catering properties. So hunting town, Russian cottage. They would, they would stop when you, when we, we talked about it at the beginning of, at the beginning of last month.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: Chats with the state cottages again. It's going to be. It's going to be brand live, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The roas was. I mean, roas is great.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's just getting those bookings up. I mean, I'm saying Roys is great, but I'm based upon.
- Them: Because they're so expensive.
- Me: You can't really. You know, it could just be one really big one, couldn't it? I mean, that's the thing with the. The self catering that they could.
- Them: No, probably not. To be honest, it's so expensive, the cottages, it's insane.
- Me: Yeah. Well, you look at this date. We've got two bookings at 3748.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: So. But it's just. Yeah, it's just trying to get them. To try to get them too far off. And again, if you've got any. Any specific packages on these or, or points of interest.
- Them: The only thing we're running for across everything is the late 20. Kind of availability. So they get to. They book within 14 days. Of the stay, they get 20% off. That's that runs nonstop.
- Me: So if they book for the next time after they've. After their first day.
- Them: No, if they like. So if they want to book a last, it's like a last minute deal, basically. So say I want to go in 13 days time I can.
- Me: Okay? So. I see, right.
- Them: 20 off. So that runs non stop.
- Me: I. I won't do that cycling until I've passed it by you because I'm sure there's some little bits of constraint.
- Them: Yeah. Late availability, free stay.
- Me: They leave it with me. Just imagine.
- Them: We don't. We don't have loads of availability. Nothing's free. But it's a full cot. It's a beautiful cottage, though, with some wonderful amenities.
- Me: English heritage.
- Them: God. Worked with us too long, Garry. Have you. Have you seen the views? The views are amazing. Access to nature. That's another lovely one. Unrivaled views.
- Me: I don't.
- Them: I'm just going to put in. We're not. We're not supposed to use hyperbole, but. No, I know. Got to be careful.
- Me: I've just put in there about the. The landing page experiment. Lovely. Thank you.
- Them: Only the right setting. Yeah. Which would be nice. There's a complete failure.
- Me: Yeah. Well. I think. I think one of the, the, the issues.
- Them: Complete failure. December 2nd. Got you. Loud and clear. Stop.
- Me: Label the point. I think one of the issues is that because the conversion rates are so low and with the the spend is relatively low, he was giving it enough clicks to make a difference. I think essentially the way to do a landing page experiment in the future is more than nuclear approach, which is what we did the first time, wasn't it? You know, we had just the image and then we moved to the filtered page where we did the, the, the jump down to the, to the bookmark. And then at least we can, we can do a like for like comparison then. But we suddenly halve the budget by doing a split AB test. We either run it for twice as long.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Or double the budget. So I've sent you the email about that. That's just a. Just a, a summary of, of what that was.
- Them: Yeah. Great. Thank you.
- Me: So that's your brand versus non brands. So weddings. There we go. That was weddings.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: And then exclusive venues.
- Them: No, for the moment, because we still in hand. I'm not sure Rachel knows when they're. When they're going live.
- Me: Yeah. Is that. Is that a Q on, then? Will it be?
- Them: Oh, if we're lucky.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: If we're lucky. I think. Yeah, there's. Yeah, there's. There's. There's. I think. I think the caravan's probably. My guess is, based on the conversations, Helen's more privy than me, but I think the caravan is probably. Distracted the attention away for a period of time. So I think. At least I would say. The sensible thing is, old Devonshire would have gone. We. We need to move these out the caravan. Well, I need you to do both. I think there is at least a sense of. Yeah, let's do the caravans first. Let's get that right. And then let's do so. I. I suspect the cat. A new. A completely new campaign around caravans will come before we move those. Those exclusive venues because I think the exclusive values are quiet.
- Me: Okay? Because. I think. Okay?
- Them: Because it's about. It's about what we do with the hall. Seems to be the. The difficult conversation. Lismore is going to be. Lismore escapes and it will have care evil on it as well. It's. It's what we do with the whole. I think, because it could. Does it go on Spolton Abbey Escapes, does it not? And all that sort of stuff. Because I. I think Helen and me have all, you know, voiced our opinions about the Fell getting lost. I think the fell will get lost even more if you suddenly chuck the hall on there because the hall has got a massive amount of content with it. You'll just think you'll go on to bowl and Abby scouts and you'll. You'll think that it's either Devon's, your arms. Or the hall. You know, it's just so hard to get. I mean, like. The number of clicks it takes to get through to anything. From the home page. It's just wild. And we both know that site a lot. And every time I go onto it, God, no, I've got. I have. You can imagine the kind of conversations I have with, like, ops. Like, they're, like, can't find anything on their website. That website's awful. I'm like, thank you. It's really helpful. No one can. No one can find anything. I'm like, okay. Why don't you go and tell Rachel rather than tell me? And she's not even Rachel, is it? Let's be honest. Not really. I know it's above Rachel. Unfortunately, it is. I know there's bits of it that are, but bits that aren't really. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, it looks nice. It does look good. But you know. Looks much nicer than the old one. Did I?
- Me: It'd be nice with a lemon to try a non American audience as well and see what happens. Yeah. Because it's only aimed towards America. Yeah, we know.
- Them: But all the evidence shows it's only the Americans that are booking it, so. Yeah. Yeah, it's not a. I. I think I'd be surprised if there isn't a Japanese audience.
- Me: Is it really?
- Them: But there doesn't appear to be much of a UK. Feel to it at all. It's very expensive.
- Me: Okay? Okay? Is it?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I can imagine. Not as though I've never tried to rent a castle, but I can imagine.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. I don't tend to do that much as. And even as castles goes, it's quite. I have had a little look when we did some testing research stuff around and, and even by castle renting standards, it's quite expensive. Cost. But you get. You get so much for it. Like I say that. But if you. If you. If you were a person of money. You'd pick that over a lot of the other options because it is really, really good. Like, the service and everything that comes with it is brilliant, if that's what you're looking for. Just. But there is just. As a result, there is only a small audience, so.
- Me: Is it difficult to market? Isn't it? Because the people that are going to stay there aren't the people searching on the Internet for it, are. They.
- Them: No. And that's why they went with those American pool. Specially salespeople. But that just didn't work. But I don't know about. Cuz they got. They chose the wrong people. I don't know. So we'll see. We'll see anyway.
- Me: Just the. The thing on Google. And pmax.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: God.
- Them: How annoying.
- Me: It was a conversation with him. I can send you a full transcript if you want, but I. He's offered to have a discussion. I think at the end of the day, got to think about what do we want to get out of it. What we want to get out is we like those back on again. They are not going back on again.
- Them: Okay? Okay?
- Me: Categorically they are not going to do it.
- Them: Sorry. Did they say why? Like.
- Me: What they said was it was. It was a technical thing that needed to go to the engineers. The technical team only have a certain amount of time to deal with things such as this. And the amount of spend that we were put into them wasn't sufficient to warrant that there were other people in the queue. So we would never be prioritized sufficiently in terms of spend for them to. To. To do something about it. And of I actually asked him for an email to set to explain this and he refused. Says that's not Google policy to do that. So it was in absence a seriously was a brick wall.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: If you want to go on a call and get incredibly frustrated with somebody, then. Then.
- Them: I don't even have time to be honest, but I mean.
- Me: Exactly. Yeah. You know, I. I've done all I can with it. I couldn't. I can't. The only. The only thing we can. We can possibly do now is to. To go to the booking engine to see when they're going to do it.
- Them: That's fine. Yeah.
- Me: So that we that would be done quicker than Google would do it.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So.
- Them: Okay? Sorry. My ignorance on that specifically. What do we need one journey to do?
- Me: They need to there. Is like.
- Them: Give them a list. Garry got a few things on there for One Journey to do. I know that's that, that and sort of that's my point is trying to. I don't know which is harder, Google or One Journey.
- Me: There is a sort of like a back end management system that one journey need to be part of, they need to subscribe to it and they need to add the properties to it.
- Them: So it's still. It's still back to that original problem.
- Me: Yep. Now the other three properties. Notice what really worries me. We're counting out hanging on by a thread. Because if Google decides to delete Those landing page URLs from those, there's also nothing we can do about that either.
- Them: Yeah. Is the. Do you think the booking by having one journey is the booking engine? Is. A big issue. Like, is that one of the biggest issues? They are like, the integration itself is poor. And they're actually from a paid point of view. Having a different booking engine. Is preferable.
- Me: Only from that perspective.
- Them: Only for the PMAX perspective. It's if, if, if the other booking engines, but I wouldn't guarantee the other book managers are that.
- Me: Only for that.
- Them: It would be a question you and said you know of any others.
- Me: It's a simple. It's a simple question to ask of the booking engine, you know? Do you allow integration into pmax? Can you prove it?
- Them: Okay? Yeah. I absolutely guarantee you guest line won't as an example. But they're even smaller than like one journey is the thing is one's own is a pretty big. I mean, like, the. The thing that's maybe confusing is because I, to be honest, didn't realize this until that long ago is that we still operate through guestline. But. One journey. Is the skin, the booking skin. That we use. So Guest line can actually offer different integrations and we are still connected to Guestline.
- Me: Right.
- Them: I didn't know that. Owner. Did not. Because I didn't either until, like, quite recently. Because I was looking at connecting with a. Like, setting up a new contract with I Escapes. And they were like, oh, yeah, did you have integration? And I was like, oh, well, I don't know. We're with one journey. And they were like, oh, no, we don't integrate with one journey. And then they list still the others. And so I pushed that back, passed on to Lena, and I was like, lena, which ones could we do as an alternative? And she's like, oh, no, we can do it through guest line, because guest line is still our. I guess, yeah.
- Me: So there the backend system. One journey of engine layer above that.
- Them: And then one journey is like the skin, yeah.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: The booking skin.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: Okay? But that's. That's interesting. I mean, guest line's not very good either. I mean, there's no getting away from the guest. Guest line. What, you moved off them because they were rubbish. But we offer. We are. We are, for certain. And it's still. It still runs, you know? Runs the high, doesn't it? Yeah, on exclusively. But then everything else actually still is line. I think we could probably.
- Me: Budget for the high through a PMAX campaign as well.
- Them: That's it. If we have a connection through a guest line instead. Which I wonder whether it's feasible.
- Me: Can I. Can I make a suggestion?
- Them: Sure.
- Me: If I get. If I ask google. To say, what do we need? What do we need to get our booking engine to do? What do they need to connect to? How do they need to do it?
- Them: Yeah, because we might have connections that we can use. Like, I know there's one through. I think it's called Star. S T, A. A H is another. Like is an integration that can be used. This is all new to me. So that would be. That would be worthwhile because we can throw that a guest. Line and we could throw that guest line on one journey and see what they say, yeah.
- Me: Right. I can guarantee a quick response from our Google rep on that one. Because at least it's in her hands.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an easy one, isn't it? It's. It's. It's worth the conversation. I mean, you know my issue with one journey. Is is not just obviously the P Max is a big problem, but I just think generally it's the same as the rest of the site. It seems to be. We've added. We basically made the book in Journey longer than it used to be. Because there's more options in there. So this is what I got back. I just copy. I'm just throwing stuff into this chat. There are pyramids, property management, journeys. Just looking at abs guest line. So the. Yeah, but it's still. I. I think it's. I know.
- Me: There's a whole new load of words in there that she don't want.
- Them: And this is all new for me, so I'm just like, okay. I still think it's. Can we run it on. I think it's one journey. You still have to. Because one journey is the. It's the com. The confirmation page is controlled. Yeah. Yeah, I. Yeah, it might do. It's. What? It's certainly worth trying. It's certainly worth trying. Okay?
- Me: It's interesting, though, isn't it? Because the. The. If you think of the tracking journey. Going to one journey. First you have to pass the. The tracking through to them. And then if it's the. The checkout itself, Is with guest line that's also got to be passed through and then pass back up the chain to Google Ads to say it's actually converted. That is complicated. Okay, I will. I'll ask the question. And then at least it can be passed on. You know, they're technical. They will understand this. They probably look at and go, yeah, we know that. I know we're not going to do it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Or. Oh, yeah, we do do that already. May. Maybe we. Maybe it's the wrong question that's been asked. I don't know.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Maybe.
- Me: But it's certainly not going to happen from Google anyway.
- Them: Okay? Great stuff.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: All right. All right. So I finalize the actions that you both there, but thank you for.
- Me: There's a dent in the wall here.
- Them: Getting the report. I get the report over later.
- Me: No worries.
- Them: Thanks.
- Me: Wonderful.
- Them: That'd be great. I mean, I know you're still fiddling with some bits, aren't you, Peter? But just once you've got those. That conversion rate.
- Me: Yeah, I think. I think as a dynamic process, I'm just going to get the. The.
- Them: So right there is. That's all good.
- Me: Okie doke.
- Them: Okay, thanks so much. Both speak to.

## Strategic Decisions

- Need to maintain minimum budget allocation across all properties to avoid business complaints
- Pause landing page experiments for Chatsworth and Bolton Abbey
- Shift to collections-based landing pages for self-catering campaigns
- Investigate alternative booking engine integrations for Google PMax

## Key Learnings

- Brand strength significantly impacts campaign performance
- The Fell struggling after rebranding, lost previous brand recognition
- Mobile optimization critical for conversion rates
- Dedicated landing pages don't always improve conversion rates

## Transcript

--- Enhanced Notes ---
### Urgent Items

- Pilsley Inn zero conversions issue

- £328 spend with 0 bookings
- Requires immediate investigation

- Chatsworth landing page test completed

- Test failed completely
- Conversion rate dropped significantly during test period

- PMax asset optimization review follow-up

- New assets added to campaigns
- Monitoring process now in place

### Budget & Performance Discussion

- December budget allocation decisions needed

- Current campaigns performing against 570% ROAS target
- Monthly spend reduced 21% in November but ROAS improved 22% month-on-month

- Scaling opportunities identified

- Several campaigns currently limited by budget
- Year-on-year performance strong: revenue up 92%, conversions up 62%
- ROAS improved from 4.3 to 6.38 year-on-year

- Hotel performance hierarchy concern

- Risk of concentrating spend only on Devonshire Arms (highest performer)
- Need minimum spend allocation per property to avoid business complaints
- Current top performers: Bailey (exceptionally strong this month), Devonshire, Chatsworth
- Underperformers: The Fell, Pilsley

### Strategic Updates & Analysis

- Brand vs non-brand analysis completed

- Devonshire Arms brand strength clearly demonstrated
- Click-through rates significantly higher for brand terms
- Bolton Abbey showing strong brand performance

- The Fell performance challenges

- Struggling since rebrand from respected Devonshire brand
- Lost brand momentum and recognition
- SEO report confirms broader visibility issues
- Needs repositioning as standalone property

- PMax campaigns impact

- Two properties removed from PMax (now down to current number)
- Cannot allocate individual budgets within PMax
- System automatically spends on most lucrative properties

### Experiments & Tests Analysis

- Bolton Abbey Landing Page test - DO NOT RUN

1. Chatsworth test failed catastrophically - dedicated landing page approach doesn’t work for this audience
2. Bolton Abbey lacks dedicated landing page infrastructure - would need building from scratch
3. Low traffic volume (\~350 clicks/month peak) insufficient for statistical significance
4. Current conversion rate (1.42% November) much higher than Chatsworth baseline (0.43%)
5. December timing terrible due to holiday search patterns

- Self-catering campaign experiment paused

- Landing page reverted to original version
- New approach needed: collections-based landing pages
- River Y25 campaign (25% off Upper Dale cottages) performing well as model

- The Hide performance review

- First full month of standalone campaign
- £2,000 budget, 20 bookings achieved
- Click-through rate 20.9% - better than some core properties
- ROAS 4.27 - strong performance for new campaign

### Technical Issues & Solutions

- Google PMax integration problem

- Google definitively refused to restore missing hotel integrations
- Insufficient spend to warrant technical team priority
- Alternative solution: work with One Journey booking engine
- Discovered: still connected to Guestline backend system
- Potential workaround through Guestline integrations available

- Website mobile optimization concerns

- Current site not designed mobile-first
- Impacts conversion rates significantly
- Desktop-focused design affecting user experience

### December Priorities & Q1 Planning

- New package launches for January-March

- Lunch/dinner included packages across all properties
- 20% discount on cottages in January
- Restaurant tour stamp initiative with £50 reward system

- Late availability offer

- 20% off for bookings within 14 days of stay
- Running continuously across all properties

- Conversion tracking fixes

- November figures affected by duplicate Highwayman tracking
- Peter working to correct year-on-year comparisons

### Action Items

- Peter: Complete conversion rate corrections for November figures
- Peter: Ask Google rep specific technical requirements for booking engine integration
- Peter: Add new package site links to campaigns when available
- Garry: Provide package details and timing for campaign updates
- Garry: Share visitor number data pre/post rebrand for The Fell analysis

Them: Hello.
Me: Hello. There.
Them: Good.
Me: I think I got the wrong day after all that. I was beginning to think I got the wrong day. Then after all that. Sorry. I've just been sat here for a while, just staring out the window. Just time overtook me.
Them: How are you doing? How you feeling?
Me: Yes. Apologies for the other day. I've had the perfect storm over the last few days. With hospital points with my sister. Doctor strikes, changed appointments, and then Claude crashed on me over the weekend, so I've spent all weekend working, so it's not been great. But anyway.
Them: Good.
Me: We're here.
Them: Nearly christmas.
Me: Yes, absolutely. You know what? I absolutely hate this time of year I have done for last 15, 20 years. I just absolutely hate it.
Them: Oh, God.
Me: Black Friday Christmas rubbish. Marketing. It's crazy. There's so much commerce is done in such a short space of time.
Them: Yeah. See that? Intense, isn't it?
Me: Just ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
Them: Yeah.
Me: My wife and I are going to go and work at the nursing home this weekend. This Christmas, rather than actually have a Christmas dinner.
Them: I feel like the same. Oh, yay. That's nice.
Me: Kick him back. Well, hopefully we'll be, as long as they don't dribble too much.
Them: That's a nice thing to do, though. I often think that sometimes nicest to do something.
Me: Wow. We also limit ourselves to 10 pound each for Christmas presents.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So that is really difficult. Really.
Them: Wow. I struggle to do a Secret Santa press up for £10. Yeah, can like, what do you even get a mug?
Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'll give you a shortcut chat. GPT does not help at all.
Them: I'll tell you what it does help with. I. This is when the world has moved on. My. I'm helping my mum understand stuff to do with pensions at the moment to deal with. My. My dad passed away and as a result, we are. We are. I'm trying to work out what she's. Due and I've spent an hour with chat GPT and. And now it's even drafted an official letter to go back to the Department of Wages and Pensions to explain what she's entitled to. It's just mine. I spoke to at my pension guy and he basically said, I don't know. That area that well.
Me: Brilliant.
Them: He goes, but I'm pretty confident if you. I'll read it for you. And I get. He went, did you write this? I went, no, that's amazing.
Me: Nice.
Them: Wow. So there you go. It can be a force for good. It can be a force for good.
Me: Nice.
Them: It can. It can.
Me: Well, on. On Sunday, I came across an 8. By Saturday, I came across an issue.
Them: So.
Me: And it turns out there's something wrong with Claude. I spent six hours thinking it was me. It was actually Claude that was wrong.
Them: Who. Who would. Who would. Who would believe it?
Me: I know. Well, you don't, do you? And so you always suspect yourself rather than the AI.
Them: That. And that. And that is the danger, because at the end of the day, rubbish. Uni's rubbish out, I'm afraid. So if it gets hold of misleading articles, wrong information, then it's only going to spuriously come back to you. But anyway.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Anyway.
Me: Apologies. I've started off with the right old moan. Do you want me to start again? Come back on again?
Them: You know what? I feel like there's something in the. In the air lately. I feel like everyone I speak to, it's quite, like, somber.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Like. Felt like you need to get some energy in.
Me: I'll try and g up a little bit with these.
Them: It's positivity. You've gone. You've gone for the. Your jumpers. Almost Christmassy, but. And quite bright, can I say? Yeah, we've gone for orange today. You've made a real bet.
Me: Figures. Yeah, absolutely. We've disgun figure a Garry.
Them: Yeah, sorry. Yeah. It's pretty good. I did have a Christmas. I did have a Christmas jumper on yesterday. It was a red one. So, you know. Yeah, Sorry. Sorry. I should have kept that going today, but there you go, right? Remind me, do you share or do I share Green Pete?
Me: I will share with you.
Them: Cool. I'll let you do. That.
Me: Tada. So one of the issues I've had over the weekend is it just trashed this report. Before I could actually do finish it off. So I've been redoing this. So apologies if there's any glaring mistakes in this. I've literally been doing this up to five minutes ago, just tightening it up a little bit. So all good, really. So we reduced the spend in accordance with the budget last.
Them: Okay?
Me: Month. That's produced a drop in revenue, but not in proportion to the spend. Which was quite nice. The thing that's making a real difference at the moment is reviewing this during the month to see what hotels are working, which ones aren't. I think the danger is not to do it too much. I'm trying to give each property a decent percentage of the spend.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But I think we talked about this last time, but at the end of the day, I feel as though it's been judged on roas more than anything else, rather than the number of bookings we're getting for the individual hotels.
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: But in some respects it has to do. Some of the hotels are more responsive to Google Ads than others. So many specs going for low hanging fruits. We're fishing where the fish are. But I just want to flag it really, that I don't just want to be chasing roas. Otherwise we're going to end up just spending money on the Devonshire.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because.
Them: I'm debon charms. Yeah, because that was. That one does do well, doesn't it? So what would you. What's your alternative?
Me: Well, it's just been aware of it. We could say, well, what percentage, what percentage of the spend do you want to spend on each hotel? And we optimize each one of them towards that. Towards that spend, you know, what is the expectation of the business for each property? And it's a big one to say, well, what do you expect to get out of Google Ads for each property? Nobody knows really, do they, until you actually do it. We have sufficient data in here. And I think when I'm making suggestions to you as far as budget changes are concerned,
Them: No.
Me: I'm conscious of. Trying to give all of them the benefit of the doubt, but also pushing it towards the ones that are going to give us the bookings. We start off the month with a proportion for each one of them.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's not helped, the PMAX thing, that we're now two down on pmax and you can't allocate individual budgets to individual hotels within pmax. You just give it a budget and it goes and spends it on the most lucrative of those. I don't really have an answer for. You really?
Them: Yeah. I think. I think we need.
Me: Because it is mixed up with what the business wants.
Them: A. I think we've got to have a minimum. I don't know what that is, but I think, like, we've got to have a minimum because I want you, right? We can't get into a situation. It's just we spend all the money on the two best hotels.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Because. Because otherwise we're not. We're not helping the other hotels. You do that for about two months and then suddenly you get the business shouting going. The fell. Struggling, really struggling. What we doing to help them type of thing.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. And that could be responsive to that. You know, if there is a seasonal drop for a hotel, and I could always increase the budget if it seemed to be a separate marketing span for that.
Them: But you, as you say, it's. I mean, it's so intent driven, though, isn't it? So, like, you know, I can't. We can't magic conversions if they're not, you know, if the market isn't there to do it. So I feel like, you know, it is a bit. Of a. A mixture in terms of that strategy because, you know, we'll take your expertise and your guidance in terms of where that budget is best, then. You know, with the expectation that ultimately we're looking for more sales. So wherever that needs to be is where it needs to be. And then that's the conversation I can have this side. And just to manage expectations, to say, look, you know, based on however long we've been running these campaigns, Devon's performance really well on paid search and on performance, Max fell less. So we therefore recommend we have. Do you know what I mean? Like, that's the kind of story that can say,
Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's why I have in my mind's eye when I'm doing it. Yeah, definitely. You know, if it says if. If the. If the budget looks like. Or we should be spending two quid on the Bailey, I'm gonna go, no, we can't actually do that. A reasonable amount in. There.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So I'm. I'm just. I'm just. I'm flagging it, really, just to, you know, say I. I don't want to get to that point. And there will be allowances if I, you know, I'm coming back saying 745roas would be, you know, that's. Fantastic. Well, yeah, I could probably get that higher than that if we just went. If we just went for the. For the. The Devonshire.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But.
Them: Am I right in thinking that last month when we, you know, did that. And so we had a really good roas. For Devon trams, and then we upped the budgets, but it didn't necessarily convert the same rate as maybe we were expecting that.
Me: Yeah. Overall, the budget. The, the. The extra money we put into it gave us an increase in budget in roas. Overall.
Them: Yeah, okay.
Me: So it did have an effect. It's, it's. It's difficult to be granular on that because halfway through the month, the budget had to come down anyway.
Them: Okay? Okay?
Me: Because it was running well at the beginning of the month, we were going to overspend on the. On the main budget. So it's not as though I'm just looking at the budget and saying, let's split it into, into 30 parts and that's how much it's going to spend every day. Because we came down from. Well, there was a, what, 21% drop in spend last month. So that has to be brought down gradually. I can't just say on the, on the last day of the month, right, next tomorrow it's going to be that much, because it really would upset the apple cart. So it's a, it's a bit of a moving target, but overall, it did improve the rug. Well, you can see from that, you know, 22% of month on month.
Them: It. Always starts in the. Yeah. Y. Eah.
Me: It's. It's. It's improved the roas. It had the positive effect on it.
Them: Okay?
Me: Okay? So the individual hotel performance. So, again, I've. I've consolidated these together from the search and from the pmax.
Them: It's just.
Me: The usual. The usual suspects. I mean, the Bailey's done really well this month. Is there a specific reason for that, do you think, or not?
Them: The pretty question. No, not really. Not really? Not been running in particular.
Me: Okay? Okay, and then. So Devon Shire and then Chatsworth. The Fell was the underperformer, along with the Pilsley. They were both below target. Again, I, I have no reason for, for, for a technical viewpoint why that would be the case. But they've, they've not done particularly well this month. Was it last month that fell weren't doing very well as well?
Them: The fellas haven't done well all year, so. But there's quite a bit in the SEO report as well around that as well.
Me: Okay?
Them: Okay, good. Because I think like the and this is actually part of separate note that, Garry, just our conversation around that stay and dine package and all that tracking. So one of the things that I'm being pushed on is putting more budget behind some social advertising specifically for staying down. But currently I'm struggling to understand a roas because I don't know whether it's going to hurting on that package or something else. So that's kind of like a bit of an area as well in itself is that, you know, from my perspective, Richard is saying, yeah, you know, we need to spend the money, let's spend the money, like, you know, if. Let's put it against what's working. But for the fell, I feel like we're not really seeing great performance on ppc, and I don't really know why. Like, so it's hard to then go back and say, right, okay. You know. Yeah. Let's budget. Well, there's two things I'd say. One, in terms of the I've got to find out if it's even possible to get that data. It might not be, and I don't know if we can even associate it to a campaign because the report you looking at. Even if there was data in there, wouldn't associate it to an individual campaign that way. We'll have to think about that separately, but I'm sure it can be done. But I don't. Not within the current parameters. Okay, but. But in terms of just. Is the offer being taken up?
Me: Off the. Big take.
Them: The date. The data that Lena sent us I can use. That definitely is. There's. There's loads. There's plenty of proof in there that I think the office working. Whether or not it's coming via social, I couldn't tell you. In terms of the. In terms of the fell demand. There is a mass like and this. And to your point earlier. If the demand isn't there, there is little. I was saying to the guys that as the G earlier this week, they were like, what? What? You know, they. They were looking at me, and they desperately didn't want to say this because they'd hate saying it, but I. I said it for them. There isn't anything they can do because you can't magically make people demand looking for the Fed. Yeah. You can improve the non brand stuff, which is what they've done, and that's, that's all gone up. Yeah. But, yeah, the brand is down, and. And this is. I'm trying to think of the nicest ones I can say this to you, and I'm struggling to say how to say it to Rachel. The whole brand thing is struggling since the rebrand.
Me: S.
Them: Because the Devon shirt was a respected, well known brand.
Me: The. Champion wasn't.
Them: And you can see it like I. Because I did a bit of a review of your Google business profile for the high because we were just checking some data. There's a lot of you can see. I don't think even I realized how respected Chatsworth and Devonshire brands were. Because you've seen it, because you were there. And you told me a couple of anecdotal stories. But there's a lot of people going under the premise of this. Is now the Devonshire. This is now the Chatsworth. And it's not the level they were expecting. Which then means people now that the dev. Now, the fell isn't the Devonshire fell. It's. It's lost a lot of momentum. Yeah. Devon sharms. Well, because it still says Devonshire.
Me: Expect. Ing.
Them: Because I think, like, and it may be that come through in the SEO report and it's the stuff that I would look, if I had more know, I would say if I had more time, if I had more time to dig into some of this, like, it would make it so much easier. So if you do have any of that sort of data to show pre post rebrand and the impact that's having like that would be so helpful. Just because I'm struggling, because obviously I've joined, rebranded, done, or it's underway, and I'm like, you know, implementing what's already been, you know, well underway. So I'm now having to try and work out what we do with the fel with, you know, and essentially it is start. Again, like, you know, in terms of how can we launch the Fell as a. As its own thing. It needs positioning, it needs everything. But obviously, in this interim period, We still need to make money. So that's where we're being pushed for, you know. I say we, so I'm being pushed for, you know? If that package is working, let's push that package. If this, you know, can we put more ppc? What can we do? Like, it's. That's the push back. I'm going. I think the two obvious things to do are we've got loads of data already on the lack of the brand. Terms being used now, so we can put that in into it. But also it's probably worth looking at just visitor numbers.
Me: Today.
Them: For the old site under the fell and the new site, and just seeing it's. It's exposure, because there's two sides of it, is, oh, we get enough people. Look, are we getting enough people from marketing point of view and are we getting the conversion and. They're two different things. It may be. Both. It may be one, it may be the other, I don't know. So I'll have a look. So many plain, so many like moving parts as part of it isn't there because like with a relaunch, with a new site that has a knock on effect, it's like it's at this point now where we know six months in, just being able to start thinking right, okay, what can we attribute to the loss here? Like, where is this? What's the source? So that's the bit that, you know, needs to be revisited. And I'm conscious to not be the. You know, I'm. I am a bit like, I think you are as well, a data person at heart. Yeah, yeah. So, so, you know, and I used to own a user experience company, so I, I understand that, but, you know, I'm, I'm very conscious of that. I am probably not the brand person. And the problem is, too, it's too easy for me to say, I don't think the user experience is as good on the news site because I don't. It isn't best practice and I, and I think it's too brand led and less data led. But, but, but we both know going back to the business and just saying that without evidence is, Is true. Yeah. And. And, and I am a supplier with Pete. It's your job, so I don't want to get you in trouble. No, exactly. Yeah. Okay. All right. Anyway, yeah, that would be. That would be great. Thank you, Garry.
Me: And this isn't the level of detail that you want. I actually did this brand versus non brand analysis on the, on the PPC campaigns.
Them: O.
Me: For, for the last 30 days. And I mean it's, it speaks for itself really. When you look at the click through rates on the, on the top right of brand versus on brand and the roas is, and it's like.
Them: H. Yeah. Okay, great.
Me: It's kind of obvious, but as you say, we're data driven. That is the data. Now, the caveat to this is that as far as Brand is concerned, we've got Bee, Lee and Pilsley in there, which aren't necessarily Brand, but at least surfacing those that we would deem to be brand, which is the calm edition and the damage. And you can see. Yeah, you can see them. It's a. It's a massive brand. The Devonshire Arms is just a huge brand, isn't it? You can see Bolton Abbey as well, how big that is. There'll be small, smaller numbers on. There. But again, we're back to fishing where the fish are. You know, when we took off the. The negative keyword for the Devon share, all of a sudden, whoosh, up it goes, and there is the. We don't want to be cannibalizing it. But we, you know, we've. We've had this discussion before about occupying real estate on the, on the search page on Google, which is, which is what we've got to do, really.
Them: And the truth is, that's only getting worse. It's getting harder for. For organic to get at the top of the page. We might be the top. We are generally the top three or four ranked listings for Devon Girms, but that doesn't always get you in the top half of someone's screen.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: So.
Me: Anyway. Back to where I was. Just met you, Desi, for a minute.
Them: Make it so hard for us, don't they?
Me: Yeah.
Them: So you spend more money with them. It's pay to play territory now, isn't it?
Me: I mean, you look at people like Amazon. It's been like that for years. It's just creeping into everything, isn't it? I. I was. I was reading something today about.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Is it? Something like $210 billion is going to be transacted through as a result of chat GPT this year on Christmas shopping. It's just an enormous amount. Absolutely enormous. And that is just with people playing with it. You know. Oh, I did this the other day. It'll soon become. Well, it's the same as I've always done on Google. It wouldn't be a. A great thing. So. I've got a. There's an issue with November's figures. On this. On this chart, not with the ones that we've just been looking. We're doing the year on year figures. This. I don't. When did you start, Helen? Right. Okay, so last year we had an issue with the conversion tracking.
Them: Breathe.
Me: In that the Highwayman conversion tracking was on. On some. On the. The hotel pages. As. As a result of that, it was showing that there was something like 1, 700 conversions for November. So there was two separate conversion options. So that's skewing the figures. So it's when you see the conversion. Rate and conversion percentage change on here is not necessarily correct.
Them: Okay?
Me: I am working on that. That's what I was doing 15 minutes ago, so apologies for that. I'm still working my way through it. The. The figures. The. The figures are. Are looking good on there, anyway. It's not going to make a huge amount.
Them: We're at the anniversary, aren't we? That would. It was November was when it launched, so.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So you can see the conversion rate on that one. The absolutes. That's clearly not correct. The rest of the figures are fine. Conversions, roas cost and so on. And conversion value.
Them: Okay?
Me: Is literally just that conversion rate. So the news is, the news is good year on year.
Them: Okay, great.
Me: We're still tracking in the right direction. I just did a quick. Analysis on year. On year. So. Oh, it's just going to be one of those days. There. Would you excuse me just for one minute? The dog's just arrived, panting like mad, and there's going to be a puddle on the floor if I don't let him out.
Them: No worries.
Me: So posies for this. Just one sec.
Them: Okay? Great. Well. Where are the. Where are the other priorities? Is it. Is the fell the big. Is it still that one or any other? Like it just feels very difficult currently. We have a look at the revenue report now that you know. Lena came through yesterday, and she said they were, like, barely any sales. Over the weekend. Wow. Yeah.
Me: When you get to a certain age, when you've got to go, you've got to go. And he's up that certain age, the dog.
Them: I was trying to distract Helen by talking about stuff. But now I've depressed her because I made a look at revenue report.
Me: Without a president.
Them: Yeah. I've made a look at revenue reports on. Apparently they're not good, so it's. It's okay. Right. December. Looking pretty empty next week. Very empty. January. Yeah, really, like, loads and loads of rooms still. But then, equally, we haven't launched our new, like, packages, so we're just finalizing. Or packages for next year, so. Or next quarter at least. So we're going to do like a nine on us kind of situation where we across all the group, we have lunch or dinner included. Or you get it for free, basically, as part of that price. It's not like a would be really mindful how we phrase it, because it doesn't sound like it's just a. A rate that we offer for, you know, better breakfast or, you know, dinner, bed and breakfast. It is free. Like the actual but we can't say free because it's not on brand.
Me: Complimentary.
Them: So I don't envy you at times. I know. So that's the package that we're launching across everything next quarter, but that will run from January through to March. Cottages. We're going in with quite an aggressive rate. In January, we're going to be, like, discounting 20% pretty much on most. Across the group. Just TBC on a few things on that. And then we'll have some dining offers which are, like, local. So we'll do. We're doing like a restaurant tour kind of stamp initiative, where you have to visit every single property, spend 50 quid and then you'll get 50 quid free on. Your fourth visit and entry into a prize draw for a free. Stay over somewhere. Mowgli are doing that. That's the Mowgli. Oh. Could you send me a photo there? Create it. Yeah, it's. It's like credit. Yes. It's a passport.
Me: That's a great idea.
Them: Ah, okay, cool. We're doing, like, a little. We're going to do a stamp, so actually, you can go in your wallet. Better. I think best chance of me, less chance of me forgetting to take it. Anyway, I'm doing that now. Yeah. Thank you. So, yeah, so it's kind of. We haven't launched those yet, so we've got the revenue call tomorrow to go through kind of any more outstanding things. I imagine it will be quite. Push, push, push. To get stuff through. So we're just in the middle of getting landing pages all sorted, but sell continues to be problem as to cottages, but obviously. I know we've had separate chat about that. Have you always. I know. Sorry. You might come onto this, Pete, but have you reverted the ad to the old landing page now for cottages? Yeah. Amazing. Thank you. So, yeah, I fed back that that landing page. Kind of a B test hasn't really worked and we need to revisit. Actually thinking about proper build and. Redesigning it. And I think Richard and Rachel may be quite surprised if they thought the original design was based on Airbnb. So they're quite surprised. It's not working, but it's not based on Airbnb. Yeah. So I was like, well, we just. It's not converting, so we need. To do something about it. We will. Our maps team is looking at building as a new map, but I just kind of feel like rather than everything work in silos, this needs to be one big conversation around engagement conversion rate what we want.
Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: And then work backwards rather than now. Maps team go work in isolation and build our map and us think about what they need to look like. I do know what I mean. I just would rather it all be one big project. So the plan is maybe as an interim do something like that's ok, we'll continue. Working on that as a project and actually have that mapped out. I'll speak to you separately, Garry, on what we want to do. But the other thing is, what we have seen has worked well, is we have a campaign called River Y25 for our upper Dale. Cottage collection, and that's 25% off. That's been running a while. Like, a while now. And I set that up as a separate package. On our website. And I think. And that's worked really well, and obviously it's discounted, so that's worked well. But they had some amazing kind of like, conversion off the back of that. And I think it was all to do with the fact that it was one landing page. Here are the cottages. Like, and it was just simple. And then they, you know, you click through to individual landing pages to see more about the cottage. But actually, that booking and everything was just easy because it was just built as one package, so that might be the interim that we then moved to. So we have kind of a separate. We have a page that is like chat. Go back to the collections pre me, but it was like Chatsworth collection. Up a Dale collection. Ball, Cross, Heath, Lee. And then maybe that might make things a bit clearer. Let's see for now. That could be the interim.
Me: It was interesting from those stats though, to see the percentage of people looking because it was interesting. Watch your hands as well, because you talking about that. But it's actually like that, isn't it? You know, it's the. It's mobile, and it. It made such a huge difference doing those screenshots. To see what they actually look like to someone who was searching.
Them: Yeah, they just caught. There's too much image. There's two bigger image at the top, isn't it?
Me: Well, even the corner. The callers on the bottom right hand corner covered a huge amount of space. It didn't look proportional to mobile look the same size as it would have done on desktop, not occupying a huge amount of space. And that had it. That's going to have an effect.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So it's. It's almost. They obviously are doing this, but it, you know, like, designed for mobile. Rather than having that idea of having the cottage in that side and the. And the map on that say, well, how does that actually look? When you get on mobile.
Them: Nothing on that site was designed for mobile, I'm afraid. No, it really wasn't. It was designed. It was designed for Brand. That's what will happen then, Garry. Obviously, I wasn't here then. Do you think that was. Yeah.
Me: Oh, wow.
Them: Seong pointed it out. I pointed it out. And at the time. Yeah. And it was. We, we were just like, it's not as mobile friendly as. As we'd like it to be. But of course, the problem is SEO. G's remit is more around SEO. And so they, they know, they know ui. I know, I know ux. So we, you know, the truth is, you. Know, a year ago, we came up with a design for a new cottages page, which was pretty much just land and see all the cottages and have some really cool filters at the top. And that's all it was. Yeah. And then it got. It got stopped because I said, we're going to redesign the entire site. Which made sense. There's no point, because it would have been, you know, not a quick project. But the truth is, that was then. You know, it. It's again, as Pete said. It starts with a big, beautiful image. I know. Nobody needs a big, beautiful image. I've gone. This is a landing page for people who've gone. I want to look at cottages. So show me some cottages. I don't even. I get the idea of the redesign, the map, the. The thing you showed us does look much better. But with the greatest respect, the people who are looking for it aren't looking for where am I exactly on this map? They just want to see what the patterns look like, isn't it? I think that comes later in the journey. Oh, hang on, where is it positioned in like, in relation to things I want to. Be doing while I'm there? Because it's all in the same area. It's not like it's. It's. It's not like it's a UK wide map. I know.
Me: It's another term.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. When you know this, you know this. I know. Okay, we'll put. We'll pick it up separately. Yes. People will keep it moving, though. I will. The agenda.
Me: Also good news.
Them: I'd love that, actually.
Me: Revenue growth up 92% year on year, so conversion up 62%.
Them: Cheer us up.
Me: ROAS has improved from 4.3 to 6.38. This is comparing four years. And the revenue conversion. This is. This might just be inflation, but it's gone up from 4:30 to 5:11.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So, yeah, September peak. And the nice thing, I suppose for us is that we're, we're 7.5% average ROAS for Q3. So it's all that work that we did in in earlier on in the year is, is actually paying off now and just that around a budget, so.
Them: Yeah. That is good. The only thing I would say is it's just being able to paint a picture, obviously, because we have increased spend. If you look like year on year,
Me: That's the roas. So we increased roas 48.
Them: Yeah. That's my thing. That's the rows going up when we've increased the spend is. That's, that's the bit that I'm. Because otherwise, you know, those figures are great. But then the answer is always, ever. We spent more money, so you'd hope so. Like. So as long as we can make that, we're happy with that, Roas figure that's something I can take away and be like, look, what a win. You know, we've been a really efficient with budget. And then again, that just opens up the door of being able to say, look, we need to spend because this is our untapped potential. You know, here's what we could be doing, and then back to our original chat right at the beginning. And here's where we, you know, we know it's working. Let's put more behind that, and then we can go from there.
Me: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm not going to continue to do that with a, you know, contacting you in the month just to say there is, there are all limited by budget at the moment.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But it was really. It's a case. This first week is letting it all settle down after the, the, the big drop in budget. So the roas might be because we've reduced budget and it's having to work harder. So I just have to make sure that there is actually potential there. And these strategic, you know, just for a couple of weeks. Increasing budget aren't the most efficient way of doing things, but they do actually pay off. So just got to. Just got to be careful with it. It's very easy to say you can go and spend an extra 200 pound a month, about a day if you wanted to, and you're going to get more money, but I can't categorically say that right now, today.
Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. But then I'm now going to go back to the beginning again anyway, so maybe we need to think about what that base rate needs to be.
Me: Yeah, yeah. The base rate for roas.
Them: No, in terms of spend, so that it doesn't feel like such a big jump.
Me: Yeah. Yes.
Them: Back down again.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. It's. It's the. The. The tricky one when that is, with it being seasonal, isn't it? You know, we're going to be chucking more money at it. So the. I mean, the. The market is spending the way is at the moment. At least I've got something to aim at. And I can, you know, towards the end of one month, when I know it's going to go down, I can actually start to scale it down towards the end of a month. Why we ended up with a little bit more the end of the month.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. So I'm going to be intrigued to see because obviously I'll be here a full year. From end of February, but I just. I'll be intrigued to see what January is like because. You know, is the demand going to be there, like, based on, you know, appetite to spend?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Or do people want to? I don't know. It's a hard, you know, hard industry to. Know what the.
Me: They all are this year. Is that It's. Is that financial insecurity? You know, I've not. Friday has not been brilliant.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It certainly hasn't been the huge thing. It normally is as huge, but then again, some people are saying it's great.
Them: Yeah. Could we see actually over. Over time? What would be handy is even if. I don't know if there's a category thing or whether it's a. But just to see that volume over time, just so that we're able to see, like, search volume over time.
Me: But not what I'm. Doing impressions. Okay? It? Well, it's going to be directly proportional to spend.
Them: Yeah. Okay, if you know about might not work.
Me: You know?
Them: Then.
Me: Well, we'll get that kick back again. The thing that's happened this year, of course, is CPCs have gone up as well, so you can't necessarily match.
Them: No.
Me: The two of them, I mean. CPCS is going to be down to clicks, Impressions is going to be down to visibility, but also what our targets are. I'm trying to maintain the target ROAS that we aim for to 5, 70%.
Them: Okay?
Me: I don't want to move that around too much because that really does throw all the. All the toys out the pram.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's fine, actually. That's another just being mean to know about CPTs going up. That's another thing. That would be good.
Me: Okay?
Them: Again just to highlight, because if it's again that Roas picture, really strong year on year. Despite increasing cpc. Do you know what I mean? Like, just some of that messaging is quite handy for me to, like, relay back.
Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no problem. I mean, the, the CPCs across the board in Google Ads have gone up quite dramatically recently because of the introduction of pmax. It used to be that if you wanted to bid on someone else's brand, that you would put a search campaign out there with their, their keywords in the. In the. The. The search campaign.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Now, you just put a PMAX campaign out there and it'll do it for you anyway.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
Me: So it's just whether you like it or not. So that's then pushed up the competition for the, for the, the brand. So it's also about impression share as well. You know, where do we, where do we sit?
Them: Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Me: Are we? I'll we. Are we catering for the same amount of people as we were originally in terms of the size of the market? So I could do. I could do some impression, share stuff.
Them: Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank. Yeah.
Me: Okay? Okay, no worries.
Them: Thank you.
Me: I'm flicking over these because I'm just reading these, these bullet points as we're, as you're looking at the, at the graph, so they're all there afterwards if you need to see them. So that's, that's just the profitability. It doesn't necessarily give the full picture because it's down to volume. The nice thing with the Devonshire is it's getting a high roas and it's getting a. A decent level of. Level of bookings, whereas the. The Beely is more restricted on bookings. But, yeah, it smashed it out of the part this month.
Them: Right. Thank you.
Me: Okay, so the locations. Not a huge amount to report on that because the Bolton Abbey Escape location has been. Has been stopped. Because after our discussion. So that was reallocated that the money that was going on there. So the hide. This is. This has been pretty good. I'm pleased with this.
Them: Okay, good. Good.
Me: Well, 427, 423, and it's really the first full month.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: So the algorithm is. Is now learning. Or has lurched, let's say. So we're, we're seeing that, that improvement. So 20 bookings. I mean, click through rate is fantastic. 20.9. That's, that's better than some of the core properties. So it's, it's heading the right way. I mean, we, we're still on a 2,000 pound budget. I went slightly over last month, so it's under £3 over, so I'll try and pull that. Back this month.
Them: Yeah. That's all right.
Me: So.
Them: I know I'm asking a lot. Sorry. I know I'm asking a lot, but just only click through rate then. And you said, oh, no, that's a great click through rate. Again. It'd be really good if we could just establish, like, what's an all right, click through rate, and then so we know what above averages. So it just makes it a bit easier again, so I can say, oh, yeah, like click through rates. Because it's just that. So what kind of conversation that I then rely.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, I know what you mean.
Them: So I think you know how we defining. What good is so that I can say, yeah, we smashed out the part because our average click through rate is 15% but hide is 20. Do you know what I mean?
Me: Yeah. Yeah, well, this is going to be easier when I. When I put all this onto the same table.
Them: It's. Just some of that storytelling. On the same table. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Me: Yeah. So I've kept it off for now because this is the first month.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That it's been on its own. That It's. It's been fully running for a month. So the campaign. I'll put the hide with the others.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Me: Next month. So I'm reporting the whole lot in at the same thing. But I'll also keep things like this graph going.
Them: Yeah. Great. Yes. Yeah, great.
Me: So that you can see. So. So when you say about ctr, that's, that's giving you the.
Them: Yeah. There we go. That's much easier to see.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Impressions is going to go up because you're spending more anyway. But, you know, the CTR is, is extraordinary.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Compared to last month and then compared to. I mean, I don't know about. Over in January over here. Is this a seasonal thing? We don't. We don't really know yet. Whether it is or it isn't. But I'll keep this one going and I'll put the. I'll put the hide on with the others.
Them: Great. Thank you. I. I would. What I would suggest is that in January the click through rate was unusually high for across the the board.
Me: Okay?
Them: Like, if I look. If I look back to last year for all the hotels, for January, for all the hotels, it was. It was very high. So I. So I think January is just a little bit of a freak month. I. I think you look the. The core part of the year is where most things are and that and. It pitches it. You know? The rest of the hotels rarely get. You know, their average is less than 10%, so.
Me: It'll be interesting to see how that Ctr Murray is up against conversion rate as well. Is it just browsers in January.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, is it. The dream is just, you know, sat there after with a hangover on. On New Year's Day, actually looking at. Looking at where they can't go, where they can't afford to go. Who knows? It just come into your mind then? You were talking before about packages and so on. It'd. Be really good to know what they are. And put some of these on site links on the on the.
Them: Yeah. Yes. I think you have staying down on there already for the foul because I think I must have mentioned that about a million times, but I'll stay in time. God.
Me: That was. Even if they're individual ones and there's a. There's a time limit on them, I can always put that on. If it just increases the ctr, then. Then even better.
Them: Yeah, that's fine. Great.
Me: So this is the self catering properties. So hunting town, Russian cottage. They would, they would stop when you, when we, we talked about it at the beginning of, at the beginning of last month.
Them: Yes.
Me: Chats with the state cottages again. It's going to be. It's going to be brand live, isn't it?
Them: Yeah.
Me: The roas was. I mean, roas is great.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's just getting those bookings up. I mean, I'm saying Roys is great, but I'm based upon.
Them: Because they're so expensive.
Me: You can't really. You know, it could just be one really big one, couldn't it? I mean, that's the thing with the. The self catering that they could.
Them: No, probably not. To be honest, it's so expensive, the cottages, it's insane.
Me: Yeah. Well, you look at this date. We've got two bookings at 3748.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: So. But it's just. Yeah, it's just trying to get them. To try to get them too far off. And again, if you've got any. Any specific packages on these or, or points of interest.
Them: The only thing we're running for across everything is the late 20. Kind of availability. So they get to. They book within 14 days. Of the stay, they get 20% off. That's that runs nonstop.
Me: So if they book for the next time after they've. After their first day.
Them: No, if they like. So if they want to book a last, it's like a last minute deal, basically. So say I want to go in 13 days time I can.
Me: Okay? So. I see, right.
Them: 20 off. So that runs non stop.
Me: I. I won't do that cycling until I've passed it by you because I'm sure there's some little bits of constraint.
Them: Yeah. Late availability, free stay.
Me: They leave it with me. Just imagine.
Them: We don't. We don't have loads of availability. Nothing's free. But it's a full cot. It's a beautiful cottage, though, with some wonderful amenities.
Me: English heritage.
Them: God. Worked with us too long, Garry. Have you. Have you seen the views? The views are amazing. Access to nature. That's another lovely one. Unrivaled views.
Me: I don't.
Them: I'm just going to put in. We're not. We're not supposed to use hyperbole, but. No, I know. Got to be careful.
Me: I've just put in there about the. The landing page experiment. Lovely. Thank you.
Them: Only the right setting. Yeah. Which would be nice. There's a complete failure.
Me: Yeah. Well. I think. I think one of the, the, the issues.
Them: Complete failure. December 2nd. Got you. Loud and clear. Stop.
Me: Label the point. I think one of the issues is that because the conversion rates are so low and with the the spend is relatively low, he was giving it enough clicks to make a difference. I think essentially the way to do a landing page experiment in the future is more than nuclear approach, which is what we did the first time, wasn't it? You know, we had just the image and then we moved to the filtered page where we did the, the, the jump down to the, to the bookmark. And then at least we can, we can do a like for like comparison then. But we suddenly halve the budget by doing a split AB test. We either run it for twice as long.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Me: Or double the budget. So I've sent you the email about that. That's just a. Just a, a summary of, of what that was.
Them: Yeah. Great. Thank you.
Me: So that's your brand versus non brands. So weddings. There we go. That was weddings.
Them: Okay?
Me: And then exclusive venues.
Them: No, for the moment, because we still in hand. I'm not sure Rachel knows when they're. When they're going live.
Me: Yeah. Is that. Is that a Q on, then? Will it be?
Them: Oh, if we're lucky.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: If we're lucky. I think. Yeah, there's. Yeah, there's. There's. There's. I think. I think the caravan's probably. My guess is, based on the conversations, Helen's more privy than me, but I think the caravan is probably. Distracted the attention away for a period of time. So I think. At least I would say. The sensible thing is, old Devonshire would have gone. We. We need to move these out the caravan. Well, I need you to do both. I think there is at least a sense of. Yeah, let's do the caravans first. Let's get that right. And then let's do so. I. I suspect the cat. A new. A completely new campaign around caravans will come before we move those. Those exclusive venues because I think the exclusive values are quiet.
Me: Okay? Because. I think. Okay?
Them: Because it's about. It's about what we do with the hall. Seems to be the. The difficult conversation. Lismore is going to be. Lismore escapes and it will have care evil on it as well. It's. It's what we do with the whole. I think, because it could. Does it go on Spolton Abbey Escapes, does it not? And all that sort of stuff. Because I. I think Helen and me have all, you know, voiced our opinions about the Fell getting lost. I think the fell will get lost even more if you suddenly chuck the hall on there because the hall has got a massive amount of content with it. You'll just think you'll go on to bowl and Abby scouts and you'll. You'll think that it's either Devon's, your arms. Or the hall. You know, it's just so hard to get. I mean, like. The number of clicks it takes to get through to anything. From the home page. It's just wild. And we both know that site a lot. And every time I go onto it, God, no, I've got. I have. You can imagine the kind of conversations I have with, like, ops. Like, they're, like, can't find anything on their website. That website's awful. I'm like, thank you. It's really helpful. No one can. No one can find anything. I'm like, okay. Why don't you go and tell Rachel rather than tell me? And she's not even Rachel, is it? Let's be honest. Not really. I know it's above Rachel. Unfortunately, it is. I know there's bits of it that are, but bits that aren't really. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, it looks nice. It does look good. But you know. Looks much nicer than the old one. Did I?
Me: It'd be nice with a lemon to try a non American audience as well and see what happens. Yeah. Because it's only aimed towards America. Yeah, we know.
Them: But all the evidence shows it's only the Americans that are booking it, so. Yeah. Yeah, it's not a. I. I think I'd be surprised if there isn't a Japanese audience.
Me: Is it really?
Them: But there doesn't appear to be much of a UK. Feel to it at all. It's very expensive.
Me: Okay? Okay? Is it?
Them: Yeah.
Me: I can imagine. Not as though I've never tried to rent a castle, but I can imagine.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I don't tend to do that much as. And even as castles goes, it's quite. I have had a little look when we did some testing research stuff around and, and even by castle renting standards, it's quite expensive. Cost. But you get. You get so much for it. Like I say that. But if you. If you. If you were a person of money. You'd pick that over a lot of the other options because it is really, really good. Like, the service and everything that comes with it is brilliant, if that's what you're looking for. Just. But there is just. As a result, there is only a small audience, so.
Me: Is it difficult to market? Isn't it? Because the people that are going to stay there aren't the people searching on the Internet for it, are. They.
Them: No. And that's why they went with those American pool. Specially salespeople. But that just didn't work. But I don't know about. Cuz they got. They chose the wrong people. I don't know. So we'll see. We'll see anyway.
Me: Just the. The thing on Google. And pmax.
Them: Yeah.
Me: God.
Them: How annoying.
Me: It was a conversation with him. I can send you a full transcript if you want, but I. He's offered to have a discussion. I think at the end of the day, got to think about what do we want to get out of it. What we want to get out is we like those back on again. They are not going back on again.
Them: Okay? Okay?
Me: Categorically they are not going to do it.
Them: Sorry. Did they say why? Like.
Me: What they said was it was. It was a technical thing that needed to go to the engineers. The technical team only have a certain amount of time to deal with things such as this. And the amount of spend that we were put into them wasn't sufficient to warrant that there were other people in the queue. So we would never be prioritized sufficiently in terms of spend for them to. To. To do something about it. And of I actually asked him for an email to set to explain this and he refused. Says that's not Google policy to do that. So it was in absence a seriously was a brick wall.
Them: Okay?
Me: If you want to go on a call and get incredibly frustrated with somebody, then. Then.
Them: I don't even have time to be honest, but I mean.
Me: Exactly. Yeah. You know, I. I've done all I can with it. I couldn't. I can't. The only. The only thing we can. We can possibly do now is to. To go to the booking engine to see when they're going to do it.
Them: That's fine. Yeah.
Me: So that we that would be done quicker than Google would do it.
Them: Okay?
Me: So.
Them: Okay? Sorry. My ignorance on that specifically. What do we need one journey to do?
Me: They need to there. Is like.
Them: Give them a list. Garry got a few things on there for One Journey to do. I know that's that, that and sort of that's my point is trying to. I don't know which is harder, Google or One Journey.
Me: There is a sort of like a back end management system that one journey need to be part of, they need to subscribe to it and they need to add the properties to it.
Them: So it's still. It's still back to that original problem.
Me: Yep. Now the other three properties. Notice what really worries me. We're counting out hanging on by a thread. Because if Google decides to delete Those landing page URLs from those, there's also nothing we can do about that either.
Them: Yeah. Is the. Do you think the booking by having one journey is the booking engine? Is. A big issue. Like, is that one of the biggest issues? They are like, the integration itself is poor. And they're actually from a paid point of view. Having a different booking engine. Is preferable.
Me: Only from that perspective.
Them: Only for the PMAX perspective. It's if, if, if the other booking engines, but I wouldn't guarantee the other book managers are that.
Me: Only for that.
Them: It would be a question you and said you know of any others.
Me: It's a simple. It's a simple question to ask of the booking engine, you know? Do you allow integration into pmax? Can you prove it?
Them: Okay? Yeah. I absolutely guarantee you guest line won't as an example. But they're even smaller than like one journey is the thing is one's own is a pretty big. I mean, like, the. The thing that's maybe confusing is because I, to be honest, didn't realize this until that long ago is that we still operate through guestline. But. One journey. Is the skin, the booking skin. That we use. So Guest line can actually offer different integrations and we are still connected to Guestline.
Me: Right.
Them: I didn't know that. Owner. Did not. Because I didn't either until, like, quite recently. Because I was looking at connecting with a. Like, setting up a new contract with I Escapes. And they were like, oh, yeah, did you have integration? And I was like, oh, well, I don't know. We're with one journey. And they were like, oh, no, we don't integrate with one journey. And then they list still the others. And so I pushed that back, passed on to Lena, and I was like, lena, which ones could we do as an alternative? And she's like, oh, no, we can do it through guest line, because guest line is still our. I guess, yeah.
Me: So there the backend system. One journey of engine layer above that.
Them: And then one journey is like the skin, yeah.
Me: Wow.
Them: The booking skin.
Me: Wow.
Them: Okay? But that's. That's interesting. I mean, guest line's not very good either. I mean, there's no getting away from the guest. Guest line. What, you moved off them because they were rubbish. But we offer. We are. We are, for certain. And it's still. It still runs, you know? Runs the high, doesn't it? Yeah, on exclusively. But then everything else actually still is line. I think we could probably.
Me: Budget for the high through a PMAX campaign as well.
Them: That's it. If we have a connection through a guest line instead. Which I wonder whether it's feasible.
Me: Can I. Can I make a suggestion?
Them: Sure.
Me: If I get. If I ask google. To say, what do we need? What do we need to get our booking engine to do? What do they need to connect to? How do they need to do it?
Them: Yeah, because we might have connections that we can use. Like, I know there's one through. I think it's called Star. S T, A. A H is another. Like is an integration that can be used. This is all new to me. So that would be. That would be worthwhile because we can throw that a guest. Line and we could throw that guest line on one journey and see what they say, yeah.
Me: Right. I can guarantee a quick response from our Google rep on that one. Because at least it's in her hands.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an easy one, isn't it? It's. It's. It's worth the conversation. I mean, you know my issue with one journey. Is is not just obviously the P Max is a big problem, but I just think generally it's the same as the rest of the site. It seems to be. We've added. We basically made the book in Journey longer than it used to be. Because there's more options in there. So this is what I got back. I just copy. I'm just throwing stuff into this chat. There are pyramids, property management, journeys. Just looking at abs guest line. So the. Yeah, but it's still. I. I think it's. I know.
Me: There's a whole new load of words in there that she don't want.
Them: And this is all new for me, so I'm just like, okay. I still think it's. Can we run it on. I think it's one journey. You still have to. Because one journey is the. It's the com. The confirmation page is controlled. Yeah. Yeah, I. Yeah, it might do. It's. What? It's certainly worth trying. It's certainly worth trying. Okay?
Me: It's interesting, though, isn't it? Because the. The. If you think of the tracking journey. Going to one journey. First you have to pass the. The tracking through to them. And then if it's the. The checkout itself, Is with guest line that's also got to be passed through and then pass back up the chain to Google Ads to say it's actually converted. That is complicated. Okay, I will. I'll ask the question. And then at least it can be passed on. You know, they're technical. They will understand this. They probably look at and go, yeah, we know that. I know we're not going to do it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Or. Oh, yeah, we do do that already. May. Maybe we. Maybe it's the wrong question that's been asked. I don't know.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Maybe.
Me: But it's certainly not going to happen from Google anyway.
Them: Okay? Great stuff.
Me: Yes.
Them: All right. All right. So I finalize the actions that you both there, but thank you for.
Me: There's a dent in the wall here.
Them: Getting the report. I get the report over later.
Me: No worries.
Them: Thanks.
Me: Wonderful.
Them: That'd be great. I mean, I know you're still fiddling with some bits, aren't you, Peter? But just once you've got those. That conversion rate.
Me: Yeah, I think. I think as a dynamic process, I'm just going to get the. The.
Them: So right there is. That's all good.
Me: Okie doke.
Them: Okay, thanks so much. Both speak to.
