- 'Me: Update the damage here. Commentary with the new information that the ROAS is
  incorrect. Regarding November performance for the hide. Put the correct figures
  in there and update the commentary. Just change this one bit. The November to 1st
  to 11th. Performance for the hide.'
- 'Them: Hello.'
- 'Me: I was just about to send you a message. Then. Are we on the same link as we
  had for Friday? And the answer is yes.'
- 'Them: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry I''m a minute late. Apologies, Peter.'
- 'Me: My problem is I''m always three minutes early, and it always seems to be three
  minutes. I must be the most annoying person in the world that I''m always there
  when people get there.'
- 'Them: Not at all. I mean, I have a weekly call with all the heads of department.
  And the call has always started, like, five minutes early, so everyone always thinks
  they have to be there five minutes early. And then when people join at, like, on
  the hour,'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: People all go. Everyone thinks they''re late and they''re okay. They''ve
  joined now and then we can start. And it''s like, oh, God, like hell. So. Yeah,
  bit hectic.'
- 'Me: You don''t get paid extra for being three minutes early, though. Do you?'
- 'Them: No. No, not at all. Anyway, right? How.'
- 'Me: I''m disappointed. You got to blur background today, so I''m disappointed with
  that. I like to see the background out into the garden. It''s a lovely view.'
- 'Them: We nosy? It''s because there''s some washing up behind me. I don''t want
  you to see it.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve spun myself around. I''ve now got the French map behind me. I''ve
  just put another screen up, so I''ve got three screens now. So it''s starting to
  get a bit hectic. I''ve had to do it. I have had to do it.'
- 'Them: Very nice. Yeah, yeah. I feel like I''m the same. Like that I need. I need.
  I definitely need two screens. I think I can''t work on just one.'
- 'Me: If it start to look like that, then that''s completely wrong. Or the other
  ones is when people are doing that when they''re on the call.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I presume we''re expecting Gary.'
- 'Them: I assume so. Don''t know why we wouldn''t be. He''s even suggested 10, actually,
  didn''t he? So.'
- 'Me: Yes, he did. No worries.'
- 'Them: I felt like. I''ll join in a minute. What are you doing tomorrow? Then you''re
  off as well, are you?'
- 'Me: Yeah, I''m. I''m finishing early tomorrow. Every now and again we go through
  the calendar and go right. We''re booking that weekend. That weekend, that weekend,
  that weekend. Usually it''s about a fortnight apart. We go away in the. In the campervan.'
- 'Them: Nice.'
- 'Me: It was the last one. Excuse me. The last one was the Langdales, where there''s
  no Internet access at all, which is lovely.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Oh, perfect.'
- 'Me: So. Hi, gary.'
- 'Them: Hi, gary.'
- 'Me: ''s borrowed James''s houses. Behind him, his models.'
- 'Them: Now. This is the office. And James has moved. James has moved his things
  from home to here. So that''s what''s happened there. Anyway, Sorry teams. Took
  me a while to get going there. Oh, you''re right. No worries.'
- 'Me: So it was. We were due to go away in the van this weekend, but my brother in
  law''s got a beautiful house up in Grasmere and he''s invited us up there for the
  weekend. So it would have been but walking distance into grass. We won''t need to
  touch the car all weekend. Be nice. We''ve become old age punches. We get on the
  bus everywhere because the buses are fabulous, absolutely fabulous.'
- 'Them: Oh. Nice. Oh, how lovely. Nice. Perfect. Yeah. That knocked the bus. Good
  candy.'
- 'Me: But unlike the pensioners, we sit on the top deck and it''s an open top bus
  no matter what weather. There''s about four seats at the front. We''re slightly
  covered and the rest is all open. It''d be a good weekend.'
- 'Them: Good. I''m glad.'
- 'Me: A weekend of excess.'
- 'Them: How are you, Gary? How was Thailand? Not spoken to you on the phone since.
  Not three now. It was very good. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.
  It was everything and more. Plus, it was quite cheap. Although I felt like you were
  still working as part of it. I definitely got an email from you, but I''m kind of
  good at just going in for half an hour and just covering everything and then coming
  back out again. Yeah, yeah. Doing this, because that actually helps.'
- 'Me: You''d rather know, wouldn''t you?'
- 'Them: Yeah, that helps me settle. To be honest with you, I. Then I''m not worrying
  about it, and then I''m. What I don''t do is constantly checking my phone. No, just
  haven''t allocated half an hour or so. Yeah, it''s normally after you''ve had a
  nice day, chilled out. Yeah, yeah. To be honest with generally. I had a glass of
  pina colada in front of me and. And I was just checking the name, the dream.'
- 'Me: That was weird. That was weird to say.'
- 'Them: I know, and I''m not a fan. I''ve never really drunk them. And then suddenly
  we get out there and it''s the drink to have.'
- 'Me: Brilliant.'
- 'Them: Okay? Nice.'
- 'Me: Do the cost of flights offset with the cost of the accommodation and food when
  you get there. Because that''s always the eye Wall street bit, isn''t it?'
- "Them: Yeah, that's. It is, it's, it's a long old flight. Because it was, I mean,\
  \ we would, I think we flew into Doha and changed there and it was just like two\
  \ six and a half, two six, nine hours flight. So it was long. But yeah. It's expensive\
  \ to get there, but. But then I think there was. Eight of us. And we are. So we\
  \ didn't go all inclusive, which I normally do, but it just didn't seem worthwhile.\
  \ And I was right not to, because we, you know, we were drinking most of the day.\
  \ Drinking various things, and then in the evenings and everything else. And our\
  \ entire barbell for the whole week was \xA3450 for eight people. For 10 days. For\
  \ 10 days?"
- 'Me: Just over 50 quid each. Wow.'
- 'Them: It was. It worked out about. 6 pound per person per day. Wow. And. And. And
  trust me, my son alone was drinking mocktails like they were going out of fashion.'
- 'Me: You pay 10 quid for Queena here?'
- "Them: You know. You know what kids are like on holiday. Yeah, yeah. We worked out.\
  \ It was about. It was about \xA31 20. \xA31 20 for a cocktail. Amazing. God, that\
  \ was good. And that. That was the expensive place because that was in the hotel\
  \ when we went out."
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: Yeah, like that was like me and my brother in law went out and did. We went
  out for an entire evening for about a tener each, including dinner. Wow. And the
  food was so. Food was good. Nice.'
- 'Me: They came back the next morning.'
- 'Them: We? We only had one night out, thankfully.'
- 'Me: The rest were days out.'
- 'Them: Because. Because I was doing. I was. I was running. I was running in 94%
  humidity. It was very sweat, very sweaty. Yeah, it sounds it. Oh, no, but anyway.
  Well, I''m glad. That''s great. Thank you. Good, good, good. Nice to have you back
  anyway. It''s. Yeah, yeah, I''ve sort of jet lagged''s gone now, so I''m good now.
  Good. Good, good. Right, where should we start today, then? Should we do the Pete,
  have you.'
- 'Me: I''ll give you an update. Keep doing an update on the way I''m working at the
  Mark. I''ve vastly changed the way I''m working. I''m feeling slightly frazzled
  from it, I must admit. I''ve developed this last month, the last three, four weeks,
  a system which is an AI system to fully drag in everything about Debonshire that
  I''m aware of. So, for instance, this meeting, I think, presume everybody does it
  now. It''s recorded, it''ll be logged, the transcript will be kept and. Any action
  points from it will be saved as tasks. Any emails that we have, I do the same thing.
  I logged them. I see if there''s any action points on them and then I can act on
  it. If this would be great if you could do this, if there''s any brand guideline
  documents or documents you could share with me about marketing activity, anything.
  It might be that I find useful to incorporate in either my communication or the
  wording that we put down our adverts or do''s and don''ts colors, you name it. If
  there''s anything like that you can provide me, then that would be superb. And then
  I can put all that into. I can put all that into the system, and it just ensures
  that nothing falls between the gaps, really.'
- 'Them: What''s the system being? Was there?'
- 'Me: I''ve written it.'
- 'Them: Oh, I see. It''s like code.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Oh, I said, right. Okay. I thought you were, like, just talking about chat
  gbt. I was like.'
- 'Me: Well, it''s claude. Well chat. GPT is an LLM, a large language model. I use
  claude and I use thing called claude code.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: It''s quite weird because I''m a programmer at heart. That''s where my originally
  came from, when I came out of the Earth as a programmer. And years ago, I was using
  an operating system called unix. And now I''m looking at claw code, and it all runs
  on Unix. It''s exactly the same commands as I used to use, like, 25, 30 years ago.
  So I''m developing email synchronization systems, tasking systems, and so on. But
  I''m also dragging in all the knowledge that I can on Google Ads, latest best practice
  news, and so on. I''ve set up a newsletter about the latest stuff. In Google Ads
  land, which I''m now putting on a blog on my website. I''m not asking people to
  look at it, it''s more for SEO than anything else, but I do actually find it quite
  interesting. It''s a real buzz, but it also means, as far as devices concerned,
  it means that we can really squeeze this. We can really get the most out of this
  from a granular viewpoint. So when you say, can you do an experiment like the figures
  are sent over to you the other day about click through rates and conversion rates.
  It''s amazing what it actually uncovers, either positively or negatively. So we''ve
  just done the new landing page for the chats with. Chats with Cottages. I''m absolutely
  chucking that. And we''ll be able to see the details of that in infinite detail.
  So that''s what I''ve been working on. The slides you''re going to look at. I''m
  developing them from within the AI. It''s not a straightforward thing because it''s
  a shared slides document and it''s difficult to actually put them in. So I''m still
  cutting and pasting the actual images in and then putting my own commentary. Against
  it. So it''s been a big thing. It''s been like a 10 hour a day project to do all
  this. It''s still under development, but it does mean we can keep an eye on things.
  Our text assets stale, should we be swapping them out and the benefit we''re going
  to get. From this is it''s just going to get better and better the account, both
  in terms of click through rate and conversion rate and I will be able to report
  back to you pretty much whatever you want. If there''s anything you see today. I
  apologize for the slides today because they''ve changed completely from last month
  when I said, oh, I''ve just changed all the slides. They have actually changed again.
  But if there''s anything in there that you would like to see that''s not in there,
  then just. Please let me know and I''ll make a note of it.'
- 'Them: Ok? Ay. Cool.'
- 'Me: Or something. I''ll make a note of it anyway. But I will action it. So that''s
  where I am. Just share my screen with you. So can you see that ok?'
- 'Them: Yep, yep.'
- 'Me: So you''d asked last time about the colors and stuff. So I''ve changed the
  colors. So the estate blue and the. Is it slate or something? The background. So
  it''s a bit more in keeping with the brand.'
- 'Them: Good.'
- 'Me: So KPIs. So we were battling a little bit this month. The fact that September
  was brilliant. And it was brilliant from perspective of I think the hotel of the
  year massively helped and inflated both the revenue and the roas. They both are
  fantastic target. It lived off the back of that. If you look at the actual increase
  in revenue, 94% of it last month was due to the Cavendish and the Chatsworth Estate.
  Campaigns. So whilst these figures are down in terms of bookings, revenue and roas,
  they''re off the back of a brilliant month last month, rather than being poor.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''d be interesting to see the comparison to the month. Prior. And
  year on year. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yes, I''ll show you that. Those figures, I think actually looking at September
  against October, the Cavendish was. The revenue was down 45% and the chats with
  Inns was down 73% on September, which is disproportionate to everything else. All
  the other hotels were kept apace with where they''re usually going to be, but those
  dropped. So that would indicate that it was actually the hotel of the year that
  was the main contributing factor for that. So if you took those out.'
- 'Them: Cool. Is there a way of on that P. Is there a way of knowing exactly what
  did cause the drop, rather than, like, assuming it''s the hotel of the year just
  because we have seen a bit of actually a slower pickup for Cavendish for November,
  like, we''re actually gonna be down for the first time.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: In November across the board. That''s not just ppc, but, like, in general.
  For Cavendish, that is. So be interesting to know if you are able to pinpoint exactly
  why.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s difficult, isn''t it? Because all we can do is we can assume. Backed
  up with the stats, it''s extraordinary that if you just look at those two campaigns,
  they are responsible for 94% of the decline. And this is in October.'
- 'Them: From the other side.'
- 'Me: And I suppose it''s one thing I would comment. We''re on the 13th of November
  now. We''re halfway through the month.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''m wondering whether it be possible to have this earlier in the month. Because
  if we action changes now, they wouldn''t necessarily take full impact in November.'
- 'Them: It''s just whether you''ve got time to pull the report, to be honest, from
  my side, more than happy to pull it forwards and do you know, do this the first
  week of the month.'
- 'Me: That would be good for me. I''d like that. Because I''m looking at numbers
  and then going, oh, yeah, we''re halfway through the month now. It''s like the hide.
  The numbers I got for the hide are different to what for October. So it''s shown
  trajectory, it''s going to be. A bit more. If we did it earlier, then it would be
  give us a clearer picture of what''s happening right now rather than what happened
  last month.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s fine. Yeah, that''s absolutely fine.'
- 'Me: I think the supposition about the Hotel of the Year, if it is just those two
  campaigns, it''s a bit too much of a coincidence that they dropped so much and both
  of them had dropped round about the same amount for that period of time.'
- 'Them: So which is it? That straps are a Cavendish and.'
- 'Me: The Cavendish in the chats within. So the chats with Inns is about the Chapter
  escape type.'
- 'Them: Pillsley and Bailey.'
- 'Me: It''s not specifically at a hotel. It''s about the Chatsworth Estate hotels
  on the chats with this state. Let me flip through. So that''s a summary of what
  we''ve just been. That was what we''ve just been talking about. So year on, year
  change. You can see for October, conversions were about the same. All the numbers.
  I mean the click through rate conversion rate is commensurate with September, despite
  that boost for chats with inns and the Cavendish and the Roas percentage change.
  So this is what makes me to conclusion there''s nothing to be concerned about about
  the performance of the Google Ads campaigns.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Click through rates. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you say sorry,
  this just. On the. On this Sorry, we''ve put 24 versus 25.'
- 'Me: It''s just. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Do you mean?'
- 'Me: The percentage change between the two years.'
- 'Them: October 24 versus October? Yeah. Yeah. So they 150% increase is from 24 to
  25.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Sorry. Yes.'
- 'Them: Yeah, okay.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So green''s got a road to bad. That''s only really patronized. I didn''t
  mean it that way. I''m sure you can sort that one out.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So then the absolute figures.'
- 'Them: Okay? Cool.'
- 'Me: 24 against 25. You can see conversions are conversion rate up, but these are
  the absolutes rather than the percentage change between the two years.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay? Okay?'
- 'Me: So looking pretty healthy. And the seasonal trends are matching last year.
  If you look at the seasonal seasonal context. September to October in 2024. We saw
  a 22% drop. In revenue. And this year we''re seeing a similar amount. So we will
  see these seasonal trends, and this is reflecting those trends from year on year
  in a percentage term. So again, there''s a drop, but it''s a seasonal drop.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So it''s the same similar kind of thing last year.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Except click through rate was. Yeah, a bit. Much bigger drop last year. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And no particular reason for that in October last year. It''s nice to
  see that we''re maintaining that click through rate, I think. Sorry. Gary.'
- 'Them: There is. There is a reason for the October last year''s click through rate
  looking so terrible. We. We changed. We changed stuff on the website so a load of
  the tracking was missing.'
- 'Me: Right, okay. Okay?'
- 'Them: So. So it''s artificial. It''s. It''ll look work we only for about two weeks
  of it. So that sort of makes sense. So it''s sort of. If you, if you double that
  look consistent.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: Which site is this, though? Is this chat''s web escape? So is this.'
- 'Me: This is the hotel. So I''ll put at the bottom here what they to give it clarification
  what we''re looking at. This is the main hotel properties, excluding the hide.'
- 'Them: So that could be. So this time last year though, there was both. Devanja
  Hotel''s website. And there was chats with escapes live. Yes. So then this time
  around, the blue line, 2025, is that. I''m assuming that''s been Bolton Abbey. Escapes
  and chats with escapes. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Me: And this is click through.'
- 'Them: And it was. And.'
- 'Me: Sorry. I was gonna say would it affected the click through rate? Though.'
- 'Them: Because we weren''t we? Oh, yes. Actually, no, possibly not.'
- 'Me: It would go back the conversion rate, but not necessarily effect.'
- 'Them: Conversion. Right. Yeah. No, you''re right. You''re right. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
  I know. It''s a good point. Okay? Okay? Cool.'
- 'Me: Again. More. I''ve put all this. Obviously, I''m doing the commentary on it,
  but I''ve also done a summation of it in the slides because I don''t know whether
  you look over these afterwards. It just clarifies, okay.'
- 'Them: No. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And if you. If you need any more clarification, then just give me a shout.
  I say any deficiencies at all, then I can address it. So that''s the individual
  hotel performance as a whole, both in the PMAX and in search. We''ll move on to
  the beeline. The pills here in a minute. About pmax, but it''s maintaining where
  we wanted it to be. There was an increase in target row last month to 570, so. The
  expectation was all the target was 570. It exceeded the target for Devonshire and
  the Cavendish. Now the reason for increasing the target ROAS was to hit the expectation
  for the budget. So the budget went down last month.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So in order to hit the budget, I can either. Well, I did two things. I''d reduced
  the daily budget and I increased the target roas so it had to work hard to get where
  it went to. And yeah, Devon should just smashed it as usual.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, we increase the budget for Dave, though, as well. I didn''t know.'
- 'Me: Yes, we did. Yes, we did. I sent you the stats through on that, didn''t I?
  Okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: And then. So this is the profitability as reflected in the previous table.
  It''s nice to have a top six now. So chats with escapes at the bottom there obviously
  was. The presumption is it''s been affected by the award and Devonshire holding
  strongly. 8:57 Roys is awesome. So we''ve got this ongoing situation with.'
- 'Them: Sorry. Could you just go back one on that one? So here, where we''ve got.
  Top4 is Devon J Hotel''s Cavendish fell mid tier properties. B Lee pulls Lynn and
  he got chance of escapes hotels. What''s that? What campaign is that one? That chats
  with escapes hotels.'
- 'Me: Chapter six. That''s his states. So there''s Chatsworth Estates. So it goes
  through.'
- 'Them: So cottages.'
- 'Me: To. No, no, the hotels. But the campaign is aimed towards search terms about
  Chatsworth Escapes hotels.'
- 'Them: So. Okay, so that one doesn''t specifically talk about the individual hotels
  that are above. It just talks about the general. Okay, general. So it would be things
  like what would be kind of within that is this.'
- 'Me: Correct. Yeah. Pubes in chat with chats with his state hotels.'
- 'Them: Okay? Okay? Okay? And that''s. That''s a paid search campaign rather than
  performance. Mac, right? Okay.'
- 'Me: The only ones we can do the pmax on our actual hotels.'
- 'Them: Themselves. But then you do have a hotel''s campaign, don''t you? For performance,
  Max, which they''re all in.'
- 'Me: No. Well, I have a. I have. So I have a PMAX campaign which is all the hotels.
  It doesn''t include the hide at the moment. I probably won''t do. No. So within
  there you have asset groups. We have five asset groups which relate to the individual
  hotels, which contain the assets, text and images and. Search themes related to
  that hotel.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Now. Of course, we can''t do the hide, can we? Yeah. And you pull that
  information through.'
- 'Me: Well, from the hotel.'
- 'Them: The existing paid search campaigns, because that''s the one I queried was
  about the the Fell Hotel for.'
- 'Me: No, no. Yes. It''s keywordless.'
- 'Them: The yes.'
- 'Me: It''s keyword list, so it relates to specific searches for that hotel and maybe
  its facilities, its location and so on. So it''s a black box kind of thing. Pmax
  I have control on it in terms of which search themes and what kind of audiences
  that it goes out to. But in the main, it''s keywordless. I can see some of the search
  terms that actually far off for it. So set the details of the ones for the fell.
  It is actually targeting the fell and because it has a fel asset group.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. So this is my concern with the bell, and I know you''ve
  said that like, and you know, please do challenge me on this one, but it''s because
  all our paid activity, not all, but a lot, is talking about Devon Jeffel. And that
  doesn''t exist anymore. It''s now just the fell.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: When do we get to the point where we just switch off Devon Chevelle and it
  would just become the Fell? Because my concern is that are those. Is the brand the
  Fel Hotel stronger now and people know that''s what we are. So that when they see
  an ad for Devel, they don''t relate the two. Do you know what I mean? So, because
  we''ve seen such a decline for the Fel Hotel lately. And if we''re actively pushing
  out ads that talk about Deval, is that not confusing the message? Rather than capitalizing
  on a search like waning search volume, essentially. I think we need to find. We
  need to look at the. What? The what? The search volume. Search volume is for DemonstraFL
  versus the FEL. Don''t we? Yeah, yeah, exactly.'
- 'Me: We''re. Not. I mean, we''re. We''re talking two different things, really. Or
  I''m understanding, two different things. One is the actual search terms that people
  are using. If they want to use the Devonshire fellow, then that''s fine. Like, let
  them use the W. Charlie, that they can find it with it. The other one. Is the actual
  message.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And the message is given by the text assets which are on the ad, and there''s
  15 of them. There''s 15 headlines on there. One of them says the Devonshire fell,
  and that is likely to appear to somebody who''s looking for the Devonshire fell.
  So there''s an exact match between the. Two of them. There are other bits of the
  assets which just say they fell.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: So we''re not. We''re not necessarily promoting the Davan Chefel. We''re promoting
  what people want to look for and what they want to.'
- 'Them: So if people are not searching heavily for the DaVinci fill, it''ll naturally,
  within the campaign, start showing it less and less anyway.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it will be it.'
- 'Them: So it''s not like if someone was looking for the Fel Hotel and then we showed
  them Devonshire Fell instead. Is that the point?'
- 'Me: Will be. Yes. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, okay.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And is so that''s so that obviously, from most paid search ad point of view,
  I completely get that. Like, you know, in terms of capturing that kind of search
  volume, and we''ve still got brand equity and the search term devel, etc. But then
  what about the PMAX campaigns? Cause that''s the bit I''m not really a Fae on, so
  I don''t really understand, like, those. So it''s the same thing. Even though we''re
  like, more. Because that, for me, is always my understanding that we''re more, like,
  from a brand point of view.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: It''s, like, pushing out kind of more of, like, across different platforms.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s pulling more than pushing.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: What it''s doing is it''s pulling what the searcher is looking for and showing
  them the assets which relate to that type of search or what they think they''re
  actually looking for. So if someone searches for the dev and she fell in, a pmax
  campaign appears. Then they will potentially be shown Devonshire Fell text asset.
  It works the same way I take the I take the ad text from the search campaign and
  put that into the asset group. It''s the same text because it would craft a search
  ad from it. When the additional bit with the PMAX is it goes out to other channels
  as well, such as displaying Gmail. And again, it''s looking at context of what people
  are searching for. Uses an intelligent matching kind of thing.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. Okay? Okay? So your recommendation is to keep Devon Jeffel in.
  Even though we''re seeing. That won''t be a detriment to kind of.'
- 'Me: It has one text headline for Devin Chefel at 15.'
- 'Them: Yeah. But when I looked in the PMAX campaign, it didn''t. It was quite a
  lot more.'
- 'Me: Oh, this is great. So my mouse has just died.'
- 'Them: So that''s. That''s many queried, you know, I mean, I''m just. I''m conscious
  of, like, the challenge that we''re having around Brand at the moment. For the Fel
  Hotel, and we''ve seen a decline. For organic search, that is. But. If we''re seeing
  a decline, is it because we. Have establishing more brand for Devan Jeffel. Do you
  know what I mean? Are we kind of.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. This isn''t a branding exercise. This is intent based marketing.'
- 'Them: I know, but, like, can you see what I''m saying?'
- 'Me: This is what people want. No, I don''t.'
- 'Them: I don''t know. Am I making this? I don''t know.'
- 'Me: No, I''m sorry. It''s my misunderstanding. No, I don''t. Because this is intent
  based marketing. Someone is actively going on the web and looking for something
  and we''re giving them that thing that they''re looking for, the pmax. They are
  showing intent for that kind of thing, not to say through the keywords.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So it might have been from previous activity they got searching for the hotel.
  So we''re not going go to the Devonshire fell, even though they put the fell in.
  It''s just going to show them what the sort of thing they''re looking for. And you''ve
  look at the click through rates they resonate with that the click through rates
  are going through the roof because we''re showing the click through rates will go
  through the roof because the ad is reflecting what people are actually searching
  for.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So at what point do we. Yeah, I get. I get that. So what? At what point
  do we turn off. Devan chafell.'
- 'Me: What our concern whenever you want. But what specifically do you want me to
  turn off?'
- 'Them: Because we can''t do it forever.'
- 'Me: Because we wouldn''t want to. I would never do a negative search term for the
  Devin she fell because that would suddenly just wipe out high intent traffic.'
- 'Them: I think it''s just. Yeah. And that''s the bit he''s like, I just feel like
  there''s going to be. At some stage, there has to be, like, an extraction plan around
  it. Otherwise, we''re just kind of using. I know, obviously, if the volume is there,
  then fair enough. But I guess my ask is, like, at what point do we pull back from
  the Devon and just focus on the vowel? Can I. As a suggestion? I think. I think
  it''s less of a PPC exercise in the sense we. At some point we might say, I think
  that decision needs to be made outside of Pete and. But what I''ll do is I''ll talk
  to a CMG and get them to do some analysis. And we can track it. And for your benefit,
  then, Helen. We can look for that. We can look for that trigger point where we think.
  You know what? It''s, it''s, it''s. It''s. It''s turning off so much that actually
  there''s no point. And that''s it. We don''t want to, like, not have. You know,
  I''m not saying, oh, let''s just, you know, why are we doing it? Because I completely
  understand why it''s there, because the volume is there, but. It''s just like, I
  think when I''m seeing kind of a decline in searches for the Fel Hotel. Then my,
  my query was like, oh, is that. Is that because I don''t know. People are saying
  the Devel. Still seeing it. They go, oh, maybe I don''t want to say, maybe I will
  search for Devan Jafel because I''ve just seen it. Do you know what I mean? It''s?
  Just like I''m not. I''ll be honest. I think it''s on. I think it''s unlikely if
  you search for the spell hotel. And you suddenly saw a Devon jfel one you then research
  for the demonstrate fair? I think it''s unlikely, but. But I can but that''s something
  that they could look at. We have a look at that sort of thing. Thank you. So I''ve
  made a note. I''ve made a note to ask them to do a little bit of exercise this month.
  On it. Yeah. Great. Okay, cool. Thank you. Cool. Okay.'
- 'Me: Just as a very quick. I''ll just look at the last 30 days. For searches for
  DaVinci. Fell. None.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: In the PMAX campaign. There''s been no searches for Devonshire foul in the
  last 30 days.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: I''m a bit loath to do these on the spot, but. No, but that seems to be. And
  if you think last 30 days on the fell, it''s had a 713%.'
- 'Them: Now. No, don''t do it now. It''s.'
- 'Me: Roas. And the assets themselves. There''s only one headline with the Devonshire
  fell in it. And none of. The none of the description lines have. Devon sheffell.
  The outward facing bit of the add in PMAX. The only bit of that is one headline
  out of 15 that says the Devonshire fell. So if it makes you feel comfortable, I
  can take that out.'
- 'Them: No, it''s not. It''s not that. It''s not good. The point I''m trying to make,
  it''s not, like, my discomfort. It''s not that. Like, it''s more. I''m just. I just
  want to know, like, if that. If there was a point where we just need to. Kind of
  pull back on Devan Jebel because it''s having a detrimental effect on, you know,
  us being able to really run with the Fel Hotel. But if the volume is there and we''re
  getting the clicks through from that, and we''re getting the sale through from that,
  more importantly, that''s. Fine. I think. I just don''t want it to be at the detriment
  of being able to build out the newer brand. It''s the long term brand, like I say.
  That''s why I think. I think we can do some separate analysis to have a look at
  that. That''s fine, yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I get it.'
- 'Them: Go on to the next bit. Move on.'
- 'Me: I''m like a dog with a barrel. Now, just a very quick.'
- 'Them: No, no. Pete. Pete. Pete. Move on. Come on, it''s fine.'
- 'Me: I''m curious. Now, though. Ok?'
- 'Them: Now, Sage, your curiosity after the call.'
- 'Me: Onwards. So this ongoing issue of the Beeley and the pills, I can''t tell you
  enough how I''m on with this. I''m contacting Google on a regular basis. They tell
  me that they''re looking at it. It''s been escalated to the hotel''s people.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And nothing''s happened. I''ve emailed them again at the beginning of this
  week. I''ve got a note to email them again at the end of the week. So I''m pushing
  it. I actually think that nobody actually knows what''s happened. And unfortunately,
  we''re not in control of this. I can''t manually change this landing page URL. They
  have to go and do it.'
- 'Them: I. Know.'
- 'Me: And because technically we''re not integrated into them the way in which they
  want us to be integrated. Because this was done on a beta, the pmax integration
  was done on a beta, and they said, oh, we''ll do it. So they did do it.'
- 'Them: Y.'
- 'Me: And I don''t have any access to what they''ve done, so all I can say is I''m
  pushing it. The Billy and the Pills is still being covered by the search campaigns,
  so we''re still getting coverage on them. It''s just we''re not getting the PMAX
  coverage and looking back at historically. The pills in the Beeley weren''t the
  ones that were performing the best on pmax.'
- 'Them: Eah, no.'
- 'Me: So.'
- 'Them: It''s not. It''s not as big a loss as it would be on a different hotel.'
- 'Me: Correct. So this is location. So this is where we''re actually targeting a
  location. The chats within hotels is slightly different. This is actually location.
  So this is places where targeting rather than actual hotels. So chats with escape
  locations or Walton, Abby escapes locations. So hotels in Derbyshire, hotels in
  South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, all those kind of. Things. This is what this is
  targeting. This is the Bobby one is the one I really need to dive into because it
  is underperforming. It''s been underperforming for a while. So work needs to be
  done on that. That might be a landing page.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I don''t know. I don''t know.'
- 'Them: Is there cottages within that one as well?'
- 'Me: This isn''t self, coach.'
- 'Them: So nothing for like cottages in Bolton Abbey escapes notches in Barton Harvey
  or anything like that.'
- 'Me: No connect all that. It''s specific hotels.'
- 'Them: It''s just hotels, okay?'
- 'Me: So that''s work to be done. To improve that.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I wonder if there''s anything like for that one. Whether because I''m
  in the chats with There''s a lot more clout than Bolton Abbey. I can just in general,
  I wonder if there''s anything.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Instead there. I mean, what about kind of more of like a national park focus
  around Yorkshire Dales?'
- 'Me: I''ve done the peak district, I''ve done the dales.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s a big old list of places whether I''ll look back over the last 12 months
  and see what this is doing. They''ve only been split out fairly recently. These
  ad groups discriminate between chats with Escape and Bolton Abbey Escapes. But I
  can look back on those ad groups and see where there''s any sort of trend at all
  towards certain areas and push them a little bit more. But it''s 500 quid out of
  that budget that''s gone towards it. So it needs to be addressed. It''s been kind
  of dragging on for a while, this, with the restructure, it''s got a bit hidden.
  So now''s the time to do something about that and see. We then get to that. The
  same row as the Chatsworth escapes one. So that''s on the plan for this week. Sorry?
  For this month. So the hide. So hide started 10th of October. That''s the roas for
  October. It was always going to happen. There''s a learning period for that. It''s
  still using a lot of the keywords from the original Highwayman. To mention the fact
  of the Premier in. Yeah, there was always going to be a bit of a slow takeup. The
  conversion tracking.'
- 'Them: And yeah, Andy say like tracking wasn''t properly in place from. Can we have
  a date, Gary? From what exactly what day it was?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: It was up and running.'
- 'Me: I put early in November there, but I''m not sure about that, Gary.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, I''d be good just to have an exact day, wouldn''t it?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Thank you. I''ll get it, and I''ll update the slide with that information
  on it.'
- 'Me: Lovely.'
- 'Them: Amazing. Thank you.'
- 'Me: So, yeah, you might have to tell me about that. So it''s an image there. Gary.
  Sorry. If you let me know, I can regenerate that image and put it on.'
- 'Them: Okay? Cool. Yeah, yeah, nice problem.'
- 'Me: The monthly trend. I''ve just put impressions and CTR on here to start off
  with. I don''t think the conversions were overly relevant at this stage. So October''s
  when it all started. Impressions. Because we''re spending more money on it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It was also an increase in click through rate.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Which was encouraging.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah, that''s all fine as long as it''s going in the right direction. No
  one''s expecting.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And. Just did a quick piece on.'
- 'Them: While he''s doing that. How is hyde generally, helen? It''s good currently
  because of Christmas markets, so weekends were pretty much, like, sold out. We all
  set on Wednesday? Had our highest revenue midweek, so that was kind of so far today,
  so it''s definitely getting there. We''ve had tons of press coverage come out now,
  so I think that''s definitely helping. We had the Times. We''ve got a load more
  press days coming up, so we''ve got kind of like Waitrose in. We''ve got the sun,
  the Metro all due, like, stays. So actually, from like, a. Brand point of view,
  we do kind of expect that we''ll just continue, you know, in terms of actually getting
  the brand out there, which it will do through that. So, yeah, it''s doing okay.
  The challenge we''re having is staff. So the existing staff were retained from Beefy.
  Today''s when it was run as a premier in. So we''re having quite a lot of negative
  feedback about food. Just in terms of it being very hit and miss. So when you know
  Adam exec Shepp is there. Brilliant. When it has, like, one of his right hand men
  there. Great. But we''re getting very up and down, so quite a lot of negative reviews
  in the last couple of weeks. Just where it''s been really, really busy and then
  actually. Haven''t been able to resort it properly. The other challenge we''re having
  is we only take walk ins. So from a staffing point of view, that makes it very hard
  to resource. So the guys have no idea how many people are coming through the door
  on an evening for, like restaurant. But board wise in terms of accommodation, it''s
  doing okay. And most people do tend to eat there as well because it''s out on a
  limb, you can''t walk anywhere from there. So actually like it''s kind of a captive
  audience unless they got in their car and once somewhere else. So it does. Have
  that. I mean, I was there on Monday and Tuesday this week. And it was good. It was
  busy. It was. You know, it was good. But then I ran into customers who complained
  right at me, who didn''t know who I was, but they were like, worst hotel of my life.
  As I was, as I was checking in. So I was like, Okay, great.'
- 'Me: I definitely don''t work here.'
- "Them: Yeah, well, I had to fess up, unfortunately, but that wasn't great. So. Yeah,\
  \ it's just a bit. It's a little bit hit and miss, I'd say. I mean, bookings wise,\
  \ we're doing okay. It's just. Yeah. Whether the team are able to efficiently service\
  \ it, it's culturally very different what you want to achieve compared to what it\
  \ was before. Yeah, I mean, that's going to take a while. The other thing we're\
  \ finding is this obviously is our first, you know, affordable accommodation and,\
  \ you know, restaurant, really. But because it's under the chats with Escapes umbrella,\
  \ people expect chats with service and actually it isn't affordable place. The rooms\
  \ are under. Under \xA3100 a night. So there's almost like an expectation that it\
  \ should be better, but then from our side, we're like, well, no, because that's\
  \ the value of it. Like, it is. It's not a Cavendish. So there's a little bit of\
  \ that where, you know, we know we're never going to be. Able to do anything about\
  \ that, because it's just kind of. Are people going to have that expectation? But\
  \ actually, we're not. We're never going to be a Cavendish. It's not going to be\
  \ like that. It is an affordable accommodation, but there's still this. There's\
  \ some basics that need to be addressed, but, you know, they're doing what they\
  \ can for now, but we still need to. Get the volume in. It's not going to stop our\
  \ marketing. We still need to. You know, resign to get people there."
- 'Me: You can see why people like Ibis and the Hilton actually do these graded things
  like the Ibis Budget and Ibis Premier. And you can see why they do that because
  it''s shoving in people''s face. Don''t expect to get super duper service budget
  because it''s a budget hotel, but you can''t really do that with the hide, can you?'
- 'Them: Good. Yes. Yeah. But. But they still. But they''re still trading off. They.
  But they still trade off the Hilton. They still trade off the Ibis name, though,
  don''t they, to get people in, which is sort of what we''re doing, really, with
  Chasmov Escape, so. Exactly. Yeah, definitely.'
- 'Me: Do. Chats with budget being and any headline that I do.'
- 'Them: No. We''re certainly. Could you imagine Rachel''s face if you suggested it,
  Helen? No, I mean, like, affordable is pretty much the limit of what we can do.
  We certainly can''t do cheap. We can''t do anything like that. Brilliant. Okay.'
- 'Me: Chats with slightly less middle class. I know. It''s a bit too long that, though,
  isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Anyway, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.'
- "Me: Yeah, I just found the biggest to hide. The roas has improved since the beginning\
  \ of the month. Interestingly enough, on the small number of conversions there being,\
  \ the value has gone up. It might be just one of them that's done it, but the average\
  \ Booking value was \xA3510, so that's multiple. Days that people are booking. Whether\
  \ that's the start of a trend or not, I don't know. But. So that's what I'm seeing\
  \ at the start. So heading the right way now. The conversion's in. It should make\
  \ the world a difference."
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It begs the question. Sorry. Were you going to say something?'
- 'Them: Oh.'
- 'Me: Sorry. So it begs the question on budget, really, for the hide. We''re continuing
  with the 2,000 pound a month budget for the high.'
- 'Them: No. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''m going to pull this into the main reporting for the hotels from now on,
  but I will continue this level of reporting on the HIDE as part of it. But on the
  tables, you''ll see the HIDE as part of that. It''s going to continue as a search
  campaign in its own right. So that will be from next month. Is this graph going
  to be useful for you? Is there, are there other stats that you would prefer to see
  on it? Rather impressions in ctr, even the conversions, the bookings, if we take
  this back to the high woman, they weren''t huge numbers on there. Which is why I
  picked on CTR and Impressions as a guide to how often the ads are being seen and
  what sort of response they''re getting from them. But I can add or swap these around
  if you want to.'
- 'Them: This is fine for now and then, let''s just say. Yeah. Still early days, isn''t
  it?'
- 'Me: Open up. Ok, so these are the self catering campaigns. So the Russian cottage
  in the hunting tower have been paused. As requested. Don''t really know what to
  say about this. And we''ve got Yorkshire Cottage. You actually had a conversion
  last month. We''re hoping, then, that these are going to be influenced by the experiment
  that''s been run on them now.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- "Me: So that would hopefully will make a difference. I've looked at the numbers\
  \ for this month. It's too soon yet. It'd be four to six weeks before we actually\
  \ see anything on there. But at least the nice thing is something positive is being\
  \ done about it. And if we can already again, it's off the chats with name chats.\
  \ With self catering chats with estate cottages. We're still getting a decent kind\
  \ of roas on those. Anyway, if the challenge is to build the rest of it up, One\
  \ of my challenges is that in October that spent \xA31,000."
- 'Them: That''s fine. Yeah.'
- "Me: And that comes out of the monthly budget. So the base monthly budget for last\
  \ month was 9,000. So it was 8,000 on the call hotels and a thousand on self catering.\
  \ I'm now going to. Do that separately and say, right, there's always going to be\
  \ \xA31,000 going towards self catering, so at least it gives you the opportunity\
  \ to say, no, well, let's increase the exposure of that separately to what's happening\
  \ with the core hotels. So the reporting will reflect that next month. Weddings.\
  \ Exclusively venues and that's it."
- 'Them: Oh, great. Thank you.'
- 'Me: Sorry. You''ve expressed the wedding. The weddings is something that''s been
  worked on. I don''t know what else.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it is.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I don''t know else I can report on that.'
- 'Them: Big time on that one. I will be curious on the weddings once we''ve got the.
  The new caldera in place, because that''s when you can make proper, full inquiries
  rather than just clicking on a link. That''d be really interesting. Yeah, well,
  I''ve asked Cordero as well, just to have once. It''s still no. Still no word on
  that, by the way, Gary. But once I have to like rushing me, like. I''m glad it was.
  I''m glad they pushed you. It was such a priority for you. I was so bunis. Literally.
  They would came. I''d get people messaging me every other day. When''s it going
  live? When''s it going live? I have a weekly meeting with the ops director, and
  he was like, we''re paying for this now and needs to go live. Helen. I was like,
  I''m trying, like, can''t. I can''t ask anymore. Like, can''t work any quicker.
  So, you know when it went live, and he''s like, he literally ran through to the
  office. Well, why is it live? That bit on Caldera doesn''t work. I''m like, it''s
  not my problem. You told me to get it live, I got it live, honestly. And then I
  knew it would happen while I was away as well, because James was just like it could
  seem. I could almost feel in his emails, he''s frustration. I was fuming. It''s
  just like, yeah, very, very irritating. And then Cordero has since now been pretty
  crap. So the guy, that Charlie guy, is now no longer there. Oh, God. So it''s just
  all very. And I was like, you just sort that out. I was like, when you''re ready,
  we can put it back on. But, yeah, switching it back on is nice and easy. It''s a
  hard. Yeah. At least it''s done. But, yeah, no, thank you. And I just say to James,
  I was like, thank you. What a mess. But, yeah, weddings. We now have Kelsey and
  Isabelle. Look after weddings and they are pretty much refreshing, revitalizing
  all the offering. So everything is being looked at. I mean, they wanted to take
  everything off the website the other day, and I was like, no, let''s not do that
  for SEO. Let''s not do that. But.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: They want to try and avoid doing any pre built packages. So that might change
  a few things because of Cordero. But we are working as a deaf day. Going to revitalize
  all of their brochures. So we''re going to rewrite those. We''ll have a bit more
  of an understanding around, kind of like the key messages. Because at the moment
  I was like, we don''t know. We''re just kind of pushing things out based on what''s?
  Been run for ages. But, you know, we definitely need to optimize, but also conscious
  of changing too much all at once because you don''t know what''s made the difference.
  Exactly. So I''ve said that we''re going to do it a little bit more phased, at least,
  kind of get, you know, some of the brochure rewritten, we''ll get some of the third
  parties updated, we''ll get our own website sorted, and then we can look at, you
  know, the next bit. I will get there. I''ll keep you posted on plans, but. And timings
  for that, because then, yeah, PPC will fall in, but it''ll be once we''ve got everything
  sorted, so, yeah, we''ll work on that and I''ll let you know.'
- 'Me: We can do. We''ll do an asset text refresh and images when that happens. Great.
  Ok.'
- 'Them: Interest in. Yeah. Yeah, it''ll be everything.'
- 'Me: Well, what a difference it made on the rest of them.'
- 'Them: I know. It was good, wasn''t it? Yeah, it was good. Even just keeping it
  fresh, isn''t it?'
- 'Me: So, yeah, brilliant.'
- 'Them: So that''s good. But. Yeah, I don''t think there''s much else, really.'
- 'Me: Sorry to go over El Gran, but Lismer on the hall. What''s actually happening
  with those now?'
- 'Them: I don''t look after those ones. The best I can tell you is that when I spoke
  to Rachel, just before I went away, I said, so now we''ve gone through the. Now
  we''ve done the hide. When did we start, Lisbon? She said in the next couple of
  months, but then I don''t. Think. And I know you''re not close to Eva, Helen, but
  she might not know either. But right now I don''t think they have actually decided
  if it''s going to fall into one of the existing hotels or we''re going to create.
  The last conversation was basically, there''s going to be a Liz More Escapes type
  thing, because there''s other things around Lismore, not just. Yeah, so there''s.
  So we''re going to create effectively a Liz More escaped version. And the hall was
  then going to probably drop into in Bolton that escapes, so.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: That''s probably still the plan, but. Yeah, it is. That''s still the plan.
  All those things will still happen. It''s just timelines aren''t 100% yet. There''s
  also a lot of resourcing that needs to be done for Liz more to even really kind
  of get that off. The ground. And then the hall is quite an interesting one because
  it will come under Bolton Abbey escapes at some point. But again, it''s very close
  to the family, that one in particular, so there''s a lot more. Quite responsible
  for the current website, the Liz Moran hall website, the content that''s on it.
  Doesn''t naturally fit into Bolton Abbey escapes. In terms of the structure. We''d
  have to have a real think about how we do that structurally in the use of experience,
  so that there''s a real danger of flooding the Bolton Abbey escape site when the
  hall goes on it and losing the focus on the other hotels. Would probably be my chief
  concern. I know it''s obviously Devon. Cheers. So Devin, she''s got his own asset
  credibility anyway. But I would just content wise we could have a problem from that
  point of view. It''s the same reason that I''ve personally never been a big fan
  of the idea of putting Bolton Abbey into Bolton Abbey escapes either, because I
  think it might kill it. Yeah. I''d rather just do a brand new fresh site for bottlenebby
  and link and then have better linkage between the two sites. But TVC isn''t it?
  Yeah. Ok, cool. And then the other. The other thing is. Which is not official. Official
  yet. So this is NDA territory. That is caravan sites.'
- 'Me: Everyone gets closer to their screen now.'
- 'Them: That is caravans.'
- 'Me: Woo. Hoo. Fantastic.'
- 'Them: We are in the process. Of acquiring Caravan park, which is currently looking
  like we would control everything from the end of September with Go Live October.'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: But we will need a site before then. Well, we''ll need integration onto chats
  with escapes. Before then so that people we can start taking bookings. For post
  october. So that might be. Maybe march time. But keep you posted on timelines and
  budgets, obviously.'
- 'Me: That''s my wheelhouse. That''s my wheelhouse.'
- 'Them: Oh, is it? Yeah.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve got the camper van. We stayed on the pop up.'
- 'Them: Pete''s Peter Caravan, man. Oh, I see. Sorry. I thought you meant, like,
  another client or something. I was. Oh, great.'
- 'Me: No. We stayed on the pop up site during the fair. And the guy two doors down,
  he''s got a motorhome. He stayed on that caravan site. He''s really nice. He literally
  just walking through the wall into the estate. It''s beautiful.'
- 'Them: It''s always full. Should be an easy one. Yeah, it should be. Yeah, it should
  be. Should help us.'
- 'Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Nice, okay?'
- 'Them: Oh, good. Cool. All right. Nice one. Lovely. I don''t think there''s anything
  else. I don''t think. But, yeah, thank you for that. If there''s anything again,
  like in terms of if budget you find in budgets are capped or, you know, it really
  could spend more on a particular area, like just continuing to let us know.'
- 'Me: I sent that email to you yesterday.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Having to read that. I''ve not read that one yet.'
- 'Me: So there''s budgets to be implemented. I''ve actually got a task running every.
  I''ve got a task for nearly every Thursday, which looks at the performance over
  the last seven days and does some suggestions for budget changes. So I''ll be a
  lot more proactive with that.'
- 'Them: All right. Yeah, you have. I''ve got. I''ve got meat invested. Omg. In an
  hour. Once I''ve done that, I''ll finish off the report and send it over to you.
  Thank you. Actually, not heard from them. So, for instance, that call actually.
  So I. I don''t know if there''s stuff that''s due to be sent over or if they''re
  waiting on anything, but not heard anything since they''re call. Okay? I''ll double
  check. Cool. All right then. I will speak to you soon. Thanks for your time. Cheers.
  All right then. Bye.'
- 'Me: Bye. Bye.'
- 'Them: Bye.'

- Me: Update the damage here. Commentary with the new information that the ROAS is incorrect. Regarding November performance for the hide. Put the correct figures in there and update the commentary. Just change this one bit. The November to 1st to 11th. Performance for the hide.
- Them: Hello.
- Me: I was just about to send you a message. Then. Are we on the same link as we had for Friday? And the answer is yes.
- Them: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry I'm a minute late. Apologies, Peter.
- Me: My problem is I'm always three minutes early, and it always seems to be three minutes. I must be the most annoying person in the world that I'm always there when people get there.
- Them: Not at all. I mean, I have a weekly call with all the heads of department. And the call has always started, like, five minutes early, so everyone always thinks they have to be there five minutes early. And then when people join at, like, on the hour,
- Me: Ok?
- Them: People all go. Everyone thinks they're late and they're okay. They've joined now and then we can start. And it's like, oh, God, like hell. So. Yeah, bit hectic.
- Me: You don't get paid extra for being three minutes early, though. Do you?
- Them: No. No, not at all. Anyway, right? How.
- Me: I'm disappointed. You got to blur background today, so I'm disappointed with that. I like to see the background out into the garden. It's a lovely view.
- Them: We nosy? It's because there's some washing up behind me. I don't want you to see it.
- Me: Well, I've spun myself around. I've now got the French map behind me. I've just put another screen up, so I've got three screens now. So it's starting to get a bit hectic. I've had to do it. I have had to do it.
- Them: Very nice. Yeah, yeah. I feel like I'm the same. Like that I need. I need. I definitely need two screens. I think I can't work on just one.
- Me: If it start to look like that, then that's completely wrong. Or the other ones is when people are doing that when they're on the call.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Me: I presume we're expecting Gary.
- Them: I assume so. Don't know why we wouldn't be. He's even suggested 10, actually, didn't he? So.
- Me: Yes, he did. No worries.
- Them: I felt like. I'll join in a minute. What are you doing tomorrow? Then you're off as well, are you?
- Me: Yeah, I'm. I'm finishing early tomorrow. Every now and again we go through the calendar and go right. We're booking that weekend. That weekend, that weekend, that weekend. Usually it's about a fortnight apart. We go away in the. In the campervan.
- Them: Nice.
- Me: It was the last one. Excuse me. The last one was the Langdales, where there's no Internet access at all, which is lovely.
- Them: Yeah. Oh, perfect.
- Me: So. Hi, gary.
- Them: Hi, gary.
- Me: 's borrowed James's houses. Behind him, his models.
- Them: Now. This is the office. And James has moved. James has moved his things from home to here. So that's what's happened there. Anyway, Sorry teams. Took me a while to get going there. Oh, you're right. No worries.
- Me: So it was. We were due to go away in the van this weekend, but my brother in law's got a beautiful house up in Grasmere and he's invited us up there for the weekend. So it would have been but walking distance into grass. We won't need to touch the car all weekend. Be nice. We've become old age punches. We get on the bus everywhere because the buses are fabulous, absolutely fabulous.
- Them: Oh. Nice. Oh, how lovely. Nice. Perfect. Yeah. That knocked the bus. Good candy.
- Me: But unlike the pensioners, we sit on the top deck and it's an open top bus no matter what weather. There's about four seats at the front. We're slightly covered and the rest is all open. It'd be a good weekend.
- Them: Good. I'm glad.
- Me: A weekend of excess.
- Them: How are you, Gary? How was Thailand? Not spoken to you on the phone since. Not three now. It was very good. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was. It was everything and more. Plus, it was quite cheap. Although I felt like you were still working as part of it. I definitely got an email from you, but I'm kind of good at just going in for half an hour and just covering everything and then coming back out again. Yeah, yeah. Doing this, because that actually helps.
- Me: You'd rather know, wouldn't you?
- Them: Yeah, that helps me settle. To be honest with you, I. Then I'm not worrying about it, and then I'm. What I don't do is constantly checking my phone. No, just haven't allocated half an hour or so. Yeah, it's normally after you've had a nice day, chilled out. Yeah, yeah. To be honest with generally. I had a glass of pina colada in front of me and. And I was just checking the name, the dream.
- Me: That was weird. That was weird to say.
- Them: I know, and I'm not a fan. I've never really drunk them. And then suddenly we get out there and it's the drink to have.
- Me: Brilliant.
- Them: Okay? Nice.
- Me: Do the cost of flights offset with the cost of the accommodation and food when you get there. Because that's always the eye Wall street bit, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah, that's. It is, it's, it's a long old flight. Because it was, I mean, we would, I think we flew into Doha and changed there and it was just like two six and a half, two six, nine hours flight. So it was long. But yeah. It's expensive to get there, but. But then I think there was. Eight of us. And we are. So we didn't go all inclusive, which I normally do, but it just didn't seem worthwhile. And I was right not to, because we, you know, we were drinking most of the day. Drinking various things, and then in the evenings and everything else. And our entire barbell for the whole week was £450 for eight people. For 10 days. For 10 days?
- Me: Just over 50 quid each. Wow.
- Them: It was. It worked out about. 6 pound per person per day. Wow. And. And. And trust me, my son alone was drinking mocktails like they were going out of fashion.
- Me: You pay 10 quid for Queena here?
- Them: You know. You know what kids are like on holiday. Yeah, yeah. We worked out. It was about. It was about £1 20. £1 20 for a cocktail. Amazing. God, that was good. And that. That was the expensive place because that was in the hotel when we went out.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: Yeah, like that was like me and my brother in law went out and did. We went out for an entire evening for about a tener each, including dinner. Wow. And the food was so. Food was good. Nice.
- Me: They came back the next morning.
- Them: We? We only had one night out, thankfully.
- Me: The rest were days out.
- Them: Because. Because I was doing. I was. I was running. I was running in 94% humidity. It was very sweat, very sweaty. Yeah, it sounds it. Oh, no, but anyway. Well, I'm glad. That's great. Thank you. Good, good, good. Nice to have you back anyway. It's. Yeah, yeah, I've sort of jet lagged's gone now, so I'm good now. Good. Good, good. Right, where should we start today, then? Should we do the Pete, have you.
- Me: I'll give you an update. Keep doing an update on the way I'm working at the Mark. I've vastly changed the way I'm working. I'm feeling slightly frazzled from it, I must admit. I've developed this last month, the last three, four weeks, a system which is an AI system to fully drag in everything about Debonshire that I'm aware of. So, for instance, this meeting, I think, presume everybody does it now. It's recorded, it'll be logged, the transcript will be kept and. Any action points from it will be saved as tasks. Any emails that we have, I do the same thing. I logged them. I see if there's any action points on them and then I can act on it. If this would be great if you could do this, if there's any brand guideline documents or documents you could share with me about marketing activity, anything. It might be that I find useful to incorporate in either my communication or the wording that we put down our adverts or do's and don'ts colors, you name it. If there's anything like that you can provide me, then that would be superb. And then I can put all that into. I can put all that into the system, and it just ensures that nothing falls between the gaps, really.
- Them: What's the system being? Was there?
- Me: I've written it.
- Them: Oh, I see. It's like code.
- Me: Yes. Yeah.
- Them: Oh, I said, right. Okay. I thought you were, like, just talking about chat gbt. I was like.
- Me: Well, it's claude. Well chat. GPT is an LLM, a large language model. I use claude and I use thing called claude code.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah.
- Me: It's quite weird because I'm a programmer at heart. That's where my originally came from, when I came out of the Earth as a programmer. And years ago, I was using an operating system called unix. And now I'm looking at claw code, and it all runs on Unix. It's exactly the same commands as I used to use, like, 25, 30 years ago. So I'm developing email synchronization systems, tasking systems, and so on. But I'm also dragging in all the knowledge that I can on Google Ads, latest best practice news, and so on. I've set up a newsletter about the latest stuff. In Google Ads land, which I'm now putting on a blog on my website. I'm not asking people to look at it, it's more for SEO than anything else, but I do actually find it quite interesting. It's a real buzz, but it also means, as far as devices concerned, it means that we can really squeeze this. We can really get the most out of this from a granular viewpoint. So when you say, can you do an experiment like the figures are sent over to you the other day about click through rates and conversion rates. It's amazing what it actually uncovers, either positively or negatively. So we've just done the new landing page for the chats with. Chats with Cottages. I'm absolutely chucking that. And we'll be able to see the details of that in infinite detail. So that's what I've been working on. The slides you're going to look at. I'm developing them from within the AI. It's not a straightforward thing because it's a shared slides document and it's difficult to actually put them in. So I'm still cutting and pasting the actual images in and then putting my own commentary. Against it. So it's been a big thing. It's been like a 10 hour a day project to do all this. It's still under development, but it does mean we can keep an eye on things. Our text assets stale, should we be swapping them out and the benefit we're going to get. From this is it's just going to get better and better the account, both in terms of click through rate and conversion rate and I will be able to report back to you pretty much whatever you want. If there's anything you see today. I apologize for the slides today because they've changed completely from last month when I said, oh, I've just changed all the slides. They have actually changed again. But if there's anything in there that you would like to see that's not in there, then just. Please let me know and I'll make a note of it.
- Them: Ok? Ay. Cool.
- Me: Or something. I'll make a note of it anyway. But I will action it. So that's where I am. Just share my screen with you. So can you see that ok?
- Them: Yep, yep.
- Me: So you'd asked last time about the colors and stuff. So I've changed the colors. So the estate blue and the. Is it slate or something? The background. So it's a bit more in keeping with the brand.
- Them: Good.
- Me: So KPIs. So we were battling a little bit this month. The fact that September was brilliant. And it was brilliant from perspective of I think the hotel of the year massively helped and inflated both the revenue and the roas. They both are fantastic target. It lived off the back of that. If you look at the actual increase in revenue, 94% of it last month was due to the Cavendish and the Chatsworth Estate. Campaigns. So whilst these figures are down in terms of bookings, revenue and roas, they're off the back of a brilliant month last month, rather than being poor.
- Them: Yeah, it'd be interesting to see the comparison to the month. Prior. And year on year. Yeah.
- Me: Yes, I'll show you that. Those figures, I think actually looking at September against October, the Cavendish was. The revenue was down 45% and the chats with Inns was down 73% on September, which is disproportionate to everything else. All the other hotels were kept apace with where they're usually going to be, but those dropped. So that would indicate that it was actually the hotel of the year that was the main contributing factor for that. So if you took those out.
- Them: Cool. Is there a way of on that P. Is there a way of knowing exactly what did cause the drop, rather than, like, assuming it's the hotel of the year just because we have seen a bit of actually a slower pickup for Cavendish for November, like, we're actually gonna be down for the first time.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: In November across the board. That's not just ppc, but, like, in general. For Cavendish, that is. So be interesting to know if you are able to pinpoint exactly why.
- Me: Yeah, it's difficult, isn't it? Because all we can do is we can assume. Backed up with the stats, it's extraordinary that if you just look at those two campaigns, they are responsible for 94% of the decline. And this is in October.
- Them: From the other side.
- Me: And I suppose it's one thing I would comment. We're on the 13th of November now. We're halfway through the month.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I'm wondering whether it be possible to have this earlier in the month. Because if we action changes now, they wouldn't necessarily take full impact in November.
- Them: It's just whether you've got time to pull the report, to be honest, from my side, more than happy to pull it forwards and do you know, do this the first week of the month.
- Me: That would be good for me. I'd like that. Because I'm looking at numbers and then going, oh, yeah, we're halfway through the month now. It's like the hide. The numbers I got for the hide are different to what for October. So it's shown trajectory, it's going to be. A bit more. If we did it earlier, then it would be give us a clearer picture of what's happening right now rather than what happened last month.
- Them: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's absolutely fine.
- Me: I think the supposition about the Hotel of the Year, if it is just those two campaigns, it's a bit too much of a coincidence that they dropped so much and both of them had dropped round about the same amount for that period of time.
- Them: So which is it? That straps are a Cavendish and.
- Me: The Cavendish in the chats within. So the chats with Inns is about the Chapter escape type.
- Them: Pillsley and Bailey.
- Me: It's not specifically at a hotel. It's about the Chatsworth Estate hotels on the chats with this state. Let me flip through. So that's a summary of what we've just been. That was what we've just been talking about. So year on, year change. You can see for October, conversions were about the same. All the numbers. I mean the click through rate conversion rate is commensurate with September, despite that boost for chats with inns and the Cavendish and the Roas percentage change. So this is what makes me to conclusion there's nothing to be concerned about about the performance of the Google Ads campaigns.
- Them: Yeah. Click through rates. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you say sorry, this just. On the. On this Sorry, we've put 24 versus 25.
- Me: It's just. Yeah.
- Them: Do you mean?
- Me: The percentage change between the two years.
- Them: October 24 versus October? Yeah. Yeah. So they 150% increase is from 24 to 25.
- Me: Yeah. Sorry. Yes.
- Them: Yeah, okay.
- Me: Yeah. So green's got a road to bad. That's only really patronized. I didn't mean it that way. I'm sure you can sort that one out.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So then the absolute figures.
- Them: Okay? Cool.
- Me: 24 against 25. You can see conversions are conversion rate up, but these are the absolutes rather than the percentage change between the two years.
- Them: Yeah. Okay? Okay?
- Me: So looking pretty healthy. And the seasonal trends are matching last year. If you look at the seasonal seasonal context. September to October in 2024. We saw a 22% drop. In revenue. And this year we're seeing a similar amount. So we will see these seasonal trends, and this is reflecting those trends from year on year in a percentage term. So again, there's a drop, but it's a seasonal drop.
- Them: Yeah. So it's the same similar kind of thing last year.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Except click through rate was. Yeah, a bit. Much bigger drop last year. Yeah.
- Me: Yeah. And no particular reason for that in October last year. It's nice to see that we're maintaining that click through rate, I think. Sorry. Gary.
- Them: There is. There is a reason for the October last year's click through rate looking so terrible. We. We changed. We changed stuff on the website so a load of the tracking was missing.
- Me: Right, okay. Okay?
- Them: So. So it's artificial. It's. It'll look work we only for about two weeks of it. So that sort of makes sense. So it's sort of. If you, if you double that look consistent.
- Me: Yeah, yeah.
- Them: Which site is this, though? Is this chat's web escape? So is this.
- Me: This is the hotel. So I'll put at the bottom here what they to give it clarification what we're looking at. This is the main hotel properties, excluding the hide.
- Them: So that could be. So this time last year though, there was both. Devanja Hotel's website. And there was chats with escapes live. Yes. So then this time around, the blue line, 2025, is that. I'm assuming that's been Bolton Abbey. Escapes and chats with escapes. Yeah.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Yeah. Okay?
- Me: And this is click through.
- Them: And it was. And.
- Me: Sorry. I was gonna say would it affected the click through rate? Though.
- Them: Because we weren't we? Oh, yes. Actually, no, possibly not.
- Me: It would go back the conversion rate, but not necessarily effect.
- Them: Conversion. Right. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It's a good point. Okay? Okay? Cool.
- Me: Again. More. I've put all this. Obviously, I'm doing the commentary on it, but I've also done a summation of it in the slides because I don't know whether you look over these afterwards. It just clarifies, okay.
- Them: No. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: And if you. If you need any more clarification, then just give me a shout. I say any deficiencies at all, then I can address it. So that's the individual hotel performance as a whole, both in the PMAX and in search. We'll move on to the beeline. The pills here in a minute. About pmax, but it's maintaining where we wanted it to be. There was an increase in target row last month to 570, so. The expectation was all the target was 570. It exceeded the target for Devonshire and the Cavendish. Now the reason for increasing the target ROAS was to hit the expectation for the budget. So the budget went down last month.
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: So in order to hit the budget, I can either. Well, I did two things. I'd reduced the daily budget and I increased the target roas so it had to work hard to get where it went to. And yeah, Devon should just smashed it as usual.
- Them: Yeah, well, we increase the budget for Dave, though, as well. I didn't know.
- Me: Yes, we did. Yes, we did. I sent you the stats through on that, didn't I? Okay.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: And then. So this is the profitability as reflected in the previous table. It's nice to have a top six now. So chats with escapes at the bottom there obviously was. The presumption is it's been affected by the award and Devonshire holding strongly. 8:57 Roys is awesome. So we've got this ongoing situation with.
- Them: Sorry. Could you just go back one on that one? So here, where we've got. Top4 is Devon J Hotel's Cavendish fell mid tier properties. B Lee pulls Lynn and he got chance of escapes hotels. What's that? What campaign is that one? That chats with escapes hotels.
- Me: Chapter six. That's his states. So there's Chatsworth Estates. So it goes through.
- Them: So cottages.
- Me: To. No, no, the hotels. But the campaign is aimed towards search terms about Chatsworth Escapes hotels.
- Them: So. Okay, so that one doesn't specifically talk about the individual hotels that are above. It just talks about the general. Okay, general. So it would be things like what would be kind of within that is this.
- Me: Correct. Yeah. Pubes in chat with chats with his state hotels.
- Them: Okay? Okay? Okay? And that's. That's a paid search campaign rather than performance. Mac, right? Okay.
- Me: The only ones we can do the pmax on our actual hotels.
- Them: Themselves. But then you do have a hotel's campaign, don't you? For performance, Max, which they're all in.
- Me: No. Well, I have a. I have. So I have a PMAX campaign which is all the hotels. It doesn't include the hide at the moment. I probably won't do. No. So within there you have asset groups. We have five asset groups which relate to the individual hotels, which contain the assets, text and images and. Search themes related to that hotel.
- Them: Yeah. Now. Of course, we can't do the hide, can we? Yeah. And you pull that information through.
- Me: Well, from the hotel.
- Them: The existing paid search campaigns, because that's the one I queried was about the the Fell Hotel for.
- Me: No, no. Yes. It's keywordless.
- Them: The yes.
- Me: It's keyword list, so it relates to specific searches for that hotel and maybe its facilities, its location and so on. So it's a black box kind of thing. Pmax I have control on it in terms of which search themes and what kind of audiences that it goes out to. But in the main, it's keywordless. I can see some of the search terms that actually far off for it. So set the details of the ones for the fell. It is actually targeting the fell and because it has a fel asset group.
- Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. So this is my concern with the bell, and I know you've said that like, and you know, please do challenge me on this one, but it's because all our paid activity, not all, but a lot, is talking about Devon Jeffel. And that doesn't exist anymore. It's now just the fell.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: When do we get to the point where we just switch off Devon Chevelle and it would just become the Fell? Because my concern is that are those. Is the brand the Fel Hotel stronger now and people know that's what we are. So that when they see an ad for Devel, they don't relate the two. Do you know what I mean? So, because we've seen such a decline for the Fel Hotel lately. And if we're actively pushing out ads that talk about Deval, is that not confusing the message? Rather than capitalizing on a search like waning search volume, essentially. I think we need to find. We need to look at the. What? The what? The search volume. Search volume is for DemonstraFL versus the FEL. Don't we? Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- Me: We're. Not. I mean, we're. We're talking two different things, really. Or I'm understanding, two different things. One is the actual search terms that people are using. If they want to use the Devonshire fellow, then that's fine. Like, let them use the W. Charlie, that they can find it with it. The other one. Is the actual message.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And the message is given by the text assets which are on the ad, and there's 15 of them. There's 15 headlines on there. One of them says the Devonshire fell, and that is likely to appear to somebody who's looking for the Devonshire fell. So there's an exact match between the. Two of them. There are other bits of the assets which just say they fell.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: So we're not. We're not necessarily promoting the Davan Chefel. We're promoting what people want to look for and what they want to.
- Them: So if people are not searching heavily for the DaVinci fill, it'll naturally, within the campaign, start showing it less and less anyway.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it will be it.
- Them: So it's not like if someone was looking for the Fel Hotel and then we showed them Devonshire Fell instead. Is that the point?
- Me: Will be. Yes. Yeah.
- Them: Okay, okay.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And is so that's so that obviously, from most paid search ad point of view, I completely get that. Like, you know, in terms of capturing that kind of search volume, and we've still got brand equity and the search term devel, etc. But then what about the PMAX campaigns? Cause that's the bit I'm not really a Fae on, so I don't really understand, like, those. So it's the same thing. Even though we're like, more. Because that, for me, is always my understanding that we're more, like, from a brand point of view.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: It's, like, pushing out kind of more of, like, across different platforms.
- Me: Yeah, it's pulling more than pushing.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: What it's doing is it's pulling what the searcher is looking for and showing them the assets which relate to that type of search or what they think they're actually looking for. So if someone searches for the dev and she fell in, a pmax campaign appears. Then they will potentially be shown Devonshire Fell text asset. It works the same way I take the I take the ad text from the search campaign and put that into the asset group. It's the same text because it would craft a search ad from it. When the additional bit with the PMAX is it goes out to other channels as well, such as displaying Gmail. And again, it's looking at context of what people are searching for. Uses an intelligent matching kind of thing.
- Them: Okay? Yeah. Okay? Okay? So your recommendation is to keep Devon Jeffel in. Even though we're seeing. That won't be a detriment to kind of.
- Me: It has one text headline for Devin Chefel at 15.
- Them: Yeah. But when I looked in the PMAX campaign, it didn't. It was quite a lot more.
- Me: Oh, this is great. So my mouse has just died.
- Them: So that's. That's many queried, you know, I mean, I'm just. I'm conscious of, like, the challenge that we're having around Brand at the moment. For the Fel Hotel, and we've seen a decline. For organic search, that is. But. If we're seeing a decline, is it because we. Have establishing more brand for Devan Jeffel. Do you know what I mean? Are we kind of.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. This isn't a branding exercise. This is intent based marketing.
- Them: I know, but, like, can you see what I'm saying?
- Me: This is what people want. No, I don't.
- Them: I don't know. Am I making this? I don't know.
- Me: No, I'm sorry. It's my misunderstanding. No, I don't. Because this is intent based marketing. Someone is actively going on the web and looking for something and we're giving them that thing that they're looking for, the pmax. They are showing intent for that kind of thing, not to say through the keywords.
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: So it might have been from previous activity they got searching for the hotel. So we're not going go to the Devonshire fell, even though they put the fell in. It's just going to show them what the sort of thing they're looking for. And you've look at the click through rates they resonate with that the click through rates are going through the roof because we're showing the click through rates will go through the roof because the ad is reflecting what people are actually searching for.
- Them: Yeah. So at what point do we. Yeah, I get. I get that. So what? At what point do we turn off. Devan chafell.
- Me: What our concern whenever you want. But what specifically do you want me to turn off?
- Them: Because we can't do it forever.
- Me: Because we wouldn't want to. I would never do a negative search term for the Devin she fell because that would suddenly just wipe out high intent traffic.
- Them: I think it's just. Yeah. And that's the bit he's like, I just feel like there's going to be. At some stage, there has to be, like, an extraction plan around it. Otherwise, we're just kind of using. I know, obviously, if the volume is there, then fair enough. But I guess my ask is, like, at what point do we pull back from the Devon and just focus on the vowel? Can I. As a suggestion? I think. I think it's less of a PPC exercise in the sense we. At some point we might say, I think that decision needs to be made outside of Pete and. But what I'll do is I'll talk to a CMG and get them to do some analysis. And we can track it. And for your benefit, then, Helen. We can look for that. We can look for that trigger point where we think. You know what? It's, it's, it's. It's. It's turning off so much that actually there's no point. And that's it. We don't want to, like, not have. You know, I'm not saying, oh, let's just, you know, why are we doing it? Because I completely understand why it's there, because the volume is there, but. It's just like, I think when I'm seeing kind of a decline in searches for the Fel Hotel. Then my, my query was like, oh, is that. Is that because I don't know. People are saying the Devel. Still seeing it. They go, oh, maybe I don't want to say, maybe I will search for Devan Jafel because I've just seen it. Do you know what I mean? It's? Just like I'm not. I'll be honest. I think it's on. I think it's unlikely if you search for the spell hotel. And you suddenly saw a Devon jfel one you then research for the demonstrate fair? I think it's unlikely, but. But I can but that's something that they could look at. We have a look at that sort of thing. Thank you. So I've made a note. I've made a note to ask them to do a little bit of exercise this month. On it. Yeah. Great. Okay, cool. Thank you. Cool. Okay.
- Me: Just as a very quick. I'll just look at the last 30 days. For searches for DaVinci. Fell. None.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: In the PMAX campaign. There's been no searches for Devonshire foul in the last 30 days.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: I'm a bit loath to do these on the spot, but. No, but that seems to be. And if you think last 30 days on the fell, it's had a 713%.
- Them: Now. No, don't do it now. It's.
- Me: Roas. And the assets themselves. There's only one headline with the Devonshire fell in it. And none of. The none of the description lines have. Devon sheffell. The outward facing bit of the add in PMAX. The only bit of that is one headline out of 15 that says the Devonshire fell. So if it makes you feel comfortable, I can take that out.
- Them: No, it's not. It's not that. It's not good. The point I'm trying to make, it's not, like, my discomfort. It's not that. Like, it's more. I'm just. I just want to know, like, if that. If there was a point where we just need to. Kind of pull back on Devan Jebel because it's having a detrimental effect on, you know, us being able to really run with the Fel Hotel. But if the volume is there and we're getting the clicks through from that, and we're getting the sale through from that, more importantly, that's. Fine. I think. I just don't want it to be at the detriment of being able to build out the newer brand. It's the long term brand, like I say. That's why I think. I think we can do some separate analysis to have a look at that. That's fine, yeah.
- Me: Yeah. I get it.
- Them: Go on to the next bit. Move on.
- Me: I'm like a dog with a barrel. Now, just a very quick.
- Them: No, no. Pete. Pete. Pete. Move on. Come on, it's fine.
- Me: I'm curious. Now, though. Ok?
- Them: Now, Sage, your curiosity after the call.
- Me: Onwards. So this ongoing issue of the Beeley and the pills, I can't tell you enough how I'm on with this. I'm contacting Google on a regular basis. They tell me that they're looking at it. It's been escalated to the hotel's people.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And nothing's happened. I've emailed them again at the beginning of this week. I've got a note to email them again at the end of the week. So I'm pushing it. I actually think that nobody actually knows what's happened. And unfortunately, we're not in control of this. I can't manually change this landing page URL. They have to go and do it.
- Them: I. Know.
- Me: And because technically we're not integrated into them the way in which they want us to be integrated. Because this was done on a beta, the pmax integration was done on a beta, and they said, oh, we'll do it. So they did do it.
- Them: Y.
- Me: And I don't have any access to what they've done, so all I can say is I'm pushing it. The Billy and the Pills is still being covered by the search campaigns, so we're still getting coverage on them. It's just we're not getting the PMAX coverage and looking back at historically. The pills in the Beeley weren't the ones that were performing the best on pmax.
- Them: Eah, no.
- Me: So.
- Them: It's not. It's not as big a loss as it would be on a different hotel.
- Me: Correct. So this is location. So this is where we're actually targeting a location. The chats within hotels is slightly different. This is actually location. So this is places where targeting rather than actual hotels. So chats with escape locations or Walton, Abby escapes locations. So hotels in Derbyshire, hotels in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, all those kind of. Things. This is what this is targeting. This is the Bobby one is the one I really need to dive into because it is underperforming. It's been underperforming for a while. So work needs to be done on that. That might be a landing page.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I don't know. I don't know.
- Them: Is there cottages within that one as well?
- Me: This isn't self, coach.
- Them: So nothing for like cottages in Bolton Abbey escapes notches in Barton Harvey or anything like that.
- Me: No connect all that. It's specific hotels.
- Them: It's just hotels, okay?
- Me: So that's work to be done. To improve that.
- Them: Yeah. I wonder if there's anything like for that one. Whether because I'm in the chats with There's a lot more clout than Bolton Abbey. I can just in general, I wonder if there's anything.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Instead there. I mean, what about kind of more of like a national park focus around Yorkshire Dales?
- Me: I've done the peak district, I've done the dales.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's a big old list of places whether I'll look back over the last 12 months and see what this is doing. They've only been split out fairly recently. These ad groups discriminate between chats with Escape and Bolton Abbey Escapes. But I can look back on those ad groups and see where there's any sort of trend at all towards certain areas and push them a little bit more. But it's 500 quid out of that budget that's gone towards it. So it needs to be addressed. It's been kind of dragging on for a while, this, with the restructure, it's got a bit hidden. So now's the time to do something about that and see. We then get to that. The same row as the Chatsworth escapes one. So that's on the plan for this week. Sorry? For this month. So the hide. So hide started 10th of October. That's the roas for October. It was always going to happen. There's a learning period for that. It's still using a lot of the keywords from the original Highwayman. To mention the fact of the Premier in. Yeah, there was always going to be a bit of a slow takeup. The conversion tracking.
- Them: And yeah, Andy say like tracking wasn't properly in place from. Can we have a date, Gary? From what exactly what day it was?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: It was up and running.
- Me: I put early in November there, but I'm not sure about that, Gary.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, I'd be good just to have an exact day, wouldn't it?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Thank you. I'll get it, and I'll update the slide with that information on it.
- Me: Lovely.
- Them: Amazing. Thank you.
- Me: So, yeah, you might have to tell me about that. So it's an image there. Gary. Sorry. If you let me know, I can regenerate that image and put it on.
- Them: Okay? Cool. Yeah, yeah, nice problem.
- Me: The monthly trend. I've just put impressions and CTR on here to start off with. I don't think the conversions were overly relevant at this stage. So October's when it all started. Impressions. Because we're spending more money on it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It was also an increase in click through rate.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Which was encouraging.
- Them: Y. Eah, that's all fine as long as it's going in the right direction. No one's expecting.
- Me: Yeah. And. Just did a quick piece on.
- Them: While he's doing that. How is hyde generally, helen? It's good currently because of Christmas markets, so weekends were pretty much, like, sold out. We all set on Wednesday? Had our highest revenue midweek, so that was kind of so far today, so it's definitely getting there. We've had tons of press coverage come out now, so I think that's definitely helping. We had the Times. We've got a load more press days coming up, so we've got kind of like Waitrose in. We've got the sun, the Metro all due, like, stays. So actually, from like, a. Brand point of view, we do kind of expect that we'll just continue, you know, in terms of actually getting the brand out there, which it will do through that. So, yeah, it's doing okay. The challenge we're having is staff. So the existing staff were retained from Beefy. Today's when it was run as a premier in. So we're having quite a lot of negative feedback about food. Just in terms of it being very hit and miss. So when you know Adam exec Shepp is there. Brilliant. When it has, like, one of his right hand men there. Great. But we're getting very up and down, so quite a lot of negative reviews in the last couple of weeks. Just where it's been really, really busy and then actually. Haven't been able to resort it properly. The other challenge we're having is we only take walk ins. So from a staffing point of view, that makes it very hard to resource. So the guys have no idea how many people are coming through the door on an evening for, like restaurant. But board wise in terms of accommodation, it's doing okay. And most people do tend to eat there as well because it's out on a limb, you can't walk anywhere from there. So actually like it's kind of a captive audience unless they got in their car and once somewhere else. So it does. Have that. I mean, I was there on Monday and Tuesday this week. And it was good. It was busy. It was. You know, it was good. But then I ran into customers who complained right at me, who didn't know who I was, but they were like, worst hotel of my life. As I was, as I was checking in. So I was like, Okay, great.
- Me: I definitely don't work here.
- Them: Yeah, well, I had to fess up, unfortunately, but that wasn't great. So. Yeah, it's just a bit. It's a little bit hit and miss, I'd say. I mean, bookings wise, we're doing okay. It's just. Yeah. Whether the team are able to efficiently service it, it's culturally very different what you want to achieve compared to what it was before. Yeah, I mean, that's going to take a while. The other thing we're finding is this obviously is our first, you know, affordable accommodation and, you know, restaurant, really. But because it's under the chats with Escapes umbrella, people expect chats with service and actually it isn't affordable place. The rooms are under. Under £100 a night. So there's almost like an expectation that it should be better, but then from our side, we're like, well, no, because that's the value of it. Like, it is. It's not a Cavendish. So there's a little bit of that where, you know, we know we're never going to be. Able to do anything about that, because it's just kind of. Are people going to have that expectation? But actually, we're not. We're never going to be a Cavendish. It's not going to be like that. It is an affordable accommodation, but there's still this. There's some basics that need to be addressed, but, you know, they're doing what they can for now, but we still need to. Get the volume in. It's not going to stop our marketing. We still need to. You know, resign to get people there.
- Me: You can see why people like Ibis and the Hilton actually do these graded things like the Ibis Budget and Ibis Premier. And you can see why they do that because it's shoving in people's face. Don't expect to get super duper service budget because it's a budget hotel, but you can't really do that with the hide, can you?
- Them: Good. Yes. Yeah. But. But they still. But they're still trading off. They. But they still trade off the Hilton. They still trade off the Ibis name, though, don't they, to get people in, which is sort of what we're doing, really, with Chasmov Escape, so. Exactly. Yeah, definitely.
- Me: Do. Chats with budget being and any headline that I do.
- Them: No. We're certainly. Could you imagine Rachel's face if you suggested it, Helen? No, I mean, like, affordable is pretty much the limit of what we can do. We certainly can't do cheap. We can't do anything like that. Brilliant. Okay.
- Me: Chats with slightly less middle class. I know. It's a bit too long that, though, isn't it?
- Them: Anyway, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
- Me: Yeah, I just found the biggest to hide. The roas has improved since the beginning of the month. Interestingly enough, on the small number of conversions there being, the value has gone up. It might be just one of them that's done it, but the average Booking value was £510, so that's multiple. Days that people are booking. Whether that's the start of a trend or not, I don't know. But. So that's what I'm seeing at the start. So heading the right way now. The conversion's in. It should make the world a difference.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It begs the question. Sorry. Were you going to say something?
- Them: Oh.
- Me: Sorry. So it begs the question on budget, really, for the hide. We're continuing with the 2,000 pound a month budget for the high.
- Them: No. Yeah.
- Me: I'm going to pull this into the main reporting for the hotels from now on, but I will continue this level of reporting on the HIDE as part of it. But on the tables, you'll see the HIDE as part of that. It's going to continue as a search campaign in its own right. So that will be from next month. Is this graph going to be useful for you? Is there, are there other stats that you would prefer to see on it? Rather impressions in ctr, even the conversions, the bookings, if we take this back to the high woman, they weren't huge numbers on there. Which is why I picked on CTR and Impressions as a guide to how often the ads are being seen and what sort of response they're getting from them. But I can add or swap these around if you want to.
- Them: This is fine for now and then, let's just say. Yeah. Still early days, isn't it?
- Me: Open up. Ok, so these are the self catering campaigns. So the Russian cottage in the hunting tower have been paused. As requested. Don't really know what to say about this. And we've got Yorkshire Cottage. You actually had a conversion last month. We're hoping, then, that these are going to be influenced by the experiment that's been run on them now.
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: So that would hopefully will make a difference. I've looked at the numbers for this month. It's too soon yet. It'd be four to six weeks before we actually see anything on there. But at least the nice thing is something positive is being done about it. And if we can already again, it's off the chats with name chats. With self catering chats with estate cottages. We're still getting a decent kind of roas on those. Anyway, if the challenge is to build the rest of it up, One of my challenges is that in October that spent £1,000.
- Them: That's fine. Yeah.
- Me: And that comes out of the monthly budget. So the base monthly budget for last month was 9,000. So it was 8,000 on the call hotels and a thousand on self catering. I'm now going to. Do that separately and say, right, there's always going to be £1,000 going towards self catering, so at least it gives you the opportunity to say, no, well, let's increase the exposure of that separately to what's happening with the core hotels. So the reporting will reflect that next month. Weddings. Exclusively venues and that's it.
- Them: Oh, great. Thank you.
- Me: Sorry. You've expressed the wedding. The weddings is something that's been worked on. I don't know what else.
- Them: Yeah, it is.
- Me: Yeah, I don't know else I can report on that.
- Them: Big time on that one. I will be curious on the weddings once we've got the. The new caldera in place, because that's when you can make proper, full inquiries rather than just clicking on a link. That'd be really interesting. Yeah, well, I've asked Cordero as well, just to have once. It's still no. Still no word on that, by the way, Gary. But once I have to like rushing me, like. I'm glad it was. I'm glad they pushed you. It was such a priority for you. I was so bunis. Literally. They would came. I'd get people messaging me every other day. When's it going live? When's it going live? I have a weekly meeting with the ops director, and he was like, we're paying for this now and needs to go live. Helen. I was like, I'm trying, like, can't. I can't ask anymore. Like, can't work any quicker. So, you know when it went live, and he's like, he literally ran through to the office. Well, why is it live? That bit on Caldera doesn't work. I'm like, it's not my problem. You told me to get it live, I got it live, honestly. And then I knew it would happen while I was away as well, because James was just like it could seem. I could almost feel in his emails, he's frustration. I was fuming. It's just like, yeah, very, very irritating. And then Cordero has since now been pretty crap. So the guy, that Charlie guy, is now no longer there. Oh, God. So it's just all very. And I was like, you just sort that out. I was like, when you're ready, we can put it back on. But, yeah, switching it back on is nice and easy. It's a hard. Yeah. At least it's done. But, yeah, no, thank you. And I just say to James, I was like, thank you. What a mess. But, yeah, weddings. We now have Kelsey and Isabelle. Look after weddings and they are pretty much refreshing, revitalizing all the offering. So everything is being looked at. I mean, they wanted to take everything off the website the other day, and I was like, no, let's not do that for SEO. Let's not do that. But.
- Me: Right.
- Them: They want to try and avoid doing any pre built packages. So that might change a few things because of Cordero. But we are working as a deaf day. Going to revitalize all of their brochures. So we're going to rewrite those. We'll have a bit more of an understanding around, kind of like the key messages. Because at the moment I was like, we don't know. We're just kind of pushing things out based on what's? Been run for ages. But, you know, we definitely need to optimize, but also conscious of changing too much all at once because you don't know what's made the difference. Exactly. So I've said that we're going to do it a little bit more phased, at least, kind of get, you know, some of the brochure rewritten, we'll get some of the third parties updated, we'll get our own website sorted, and then we can look at, you know, the next bit. I will get there. I'll keep you posted on plans, but. And timings for that, because then, yeah, PPC will fall in, but it'll be once we've got everything sorted, so, yeah, we'll work on that and I'll let you know.
- Me: We can do. We'll do an asset text refresh and images when that happens. Great. Ok.
- Them: Interest in. Yeah. Yeah, it'll be everything.
- Me: Well, what a difference it made on the rest of them.
- Them: I know. It was good, wasn't it? Yeah, it was good. Even just keeping it fresh, isn't it?
- Me: So, yeah, brilliant.
- Them: So that's good. But. Yeah, I don't think there's much else, really.
- Me: Sorry to go over El Gran, but Lismer on the hall. What's actually happening with those now?
- Them: I don't look after those ones. The best I can tell you is that when I spoke to Rachel, just before I went away, I said, so now we've gone through the. Now we've done the hide. When did we start, Lisbon? She said in the next couple of months, but then I don't. Think. And I know you're not close to Eva, Helen, but she might not know either. But right now I don't think they have actually decided if it's going to fall into one of the existing hotels or we're going to create. The last conversation was basically, there's going to be a Liz More Escapes type thing, because there's other things around Lismore, not just. Yeah, so there's. So we're going to create effectively a Liz More escaped version. And the hall was then going to probably drop into in Bolton that escapes, so.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: That's probably still the plan, but. Yeah, it is. That's still the plan. All those things will still happen. It's just timelines aren't 100% yet. There's also a lot of resourcing that needs to be done for Liz more to even really kind of get that off. The ground. And then the hall is quite an interesting one because it will come under Bolton Abbey escapes at some point. But again, it's very close to the family, that one in particular, so there's a lot more. Quite responsible for the current website, the Liz Moran hall website, the content that's on it. Doesn't naturally fit into Bolton Abbey escapes. In terms of the structure. We'd have to have a real think about how we do that structurally in the use of experience, so that there's a real danger of flooding the Bolton Abbey escape site when the hall goes on it and losing the focus on the other hotels. Would probably be my chief concern. I know it's obviously Devon. Cheers. So Devin, she's got his own asset credibility anyway. But I would just content wise we could have a problem from that point of view. It's the same reason that I've personally never been a big fan of the idea of putting Bolton Abbey into Bolton Abbey escapes either, because I think it might kill it. Yeah. I'd rather just do a brand new fresh site for bottlenebby and link and then have better linkage between the two sites. But TVC isn't it? Yeah. Ok, cool. And then the other. The other thing is. Which is not official. Official yet. So this is NDA territory. That is caravan sites.
- Me: Everyone gets closer to their screen now.
- Them: That is caravans.
- Me: Woo. Hoo. Fantastic.
- Them: We are in the process. Of acquiring Caravan park, which is currently looking like we would control everything from the end of September with Go Live October.
- Me: No.
- Them: But we will need a site before then. Well, we'll need integration onto chats with escapes. Before then so that people we can start taking bookings. For post october. So that might be. Maybe march time. But keep you posted on timelines and budgets, obviously.
- Me: That's my wheelhouse. That's my wheelhouse.
- Them: Oh, is it? Yeah.
- Me: Well, I've got the camper van. We stayed on the pop up.
- Them: Pete's Peter Caravan, man. Oh, I see. Sorry. I thought you meant, like, another client or something. I was. Oh, great.
- Me: No. We stayed on the pop up site during the fair. And the guy two doors down, he's got a motorhome. He stayed on that caravan site. He's really nice. He literally just walking through the wall into the estate. It's beautiful.
- Them: It's always full. Should be an easy one. Yeah, it should be. Yeah, it should be. Should help us.
- Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Nice, okay?
- Them: Oh, good. Cool. All right. Nice one. Lovely. I don't think there's anything else. I don't think. But, yeah, thank you for that. If there's anything again, like in terms of if budget you find in budgets are capped or, you know, it really could spend more on a particular area, like just continuing to let us know.
- Me: I sent that email to you yesterday.
- Them: Yeah. Having to read that. I've not read that one yet.
- Me: So there's budgets to be implemented. I've actually got a task running every. I've got a task for nearly every Thursday, which looks at the performance over the last seven days and does some suggestions for budget changes. So I'll be a lot more proactive with that.
- Them: All right. Yeah, you have. I've got. I've got meat invested. Omg. In an hour. Once I've done that, I'll finish off the report and send it over to you. Thank you. Actually, not heard from them. So, for instance, that call actually. So I. I don't know if there's stuff that's due to be sent over or if they're waiting on anything, but not heard anything since they're call. Okay? I'll double check. Cool. All right then. I will speak to you soon. Thanks for your time. Cheers. All right then. Bye.
- Me: Bye. Bye.
- Them: Bye.

Me: Update the damage here. Commentary with the new information that the ROAS is incorrect. Regarding November performance for the hide. Put the correct figures in there and update the commentary. Just change this one bit. The November to 1st to 11th. Performance for the hide.
Them: Hello.
Me: I was just about to send you a message. Then. Are we on the same link as we had for Friday? And the answer is yes.
Them: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry I'm a minute late. Apologies, Peter.
Me: My problem is I'm always three minutes early, and it always seems to be three minutes. I must be the most annoying person in the world that I'm always there when people get there.
Them: Not at all. I mean, I have a weekly call with all the heads of department. And the call has always started, like, five minutes early, so everyone always thinks they have to be there five minutes early. And then when people join at, like, on the hour,
Me: Ok?
Them: People all go. Everyone thinks they're late and they're okay. They've joined now and then we can start. And it's like, oh, God, like hell. So. Yeah, bit hectic.
Me: You don't get paid extra for being three minutes early, though. Do you?
Them: No. No, not at all. Anyway, right? How.
Me: I'm disappointed. You got to blur background today, so I'm disappointed with that. I like to see the background out into the garden. It's a lovely view.
Them: We nosy? It's because there's some washing up behind me. I don't want you to see it.
Me: Well, I've spun myself around. I've now got the French map behind me. I've just put another screen up, so I've got three screens now. So it's starting to get a bit hectic. I've had to do it. I have had to do it.
Them: Very nice. Yeah, yeah. I feel like I'm the same. Like that I need. I need. I definitely need two screens. I think I can't work on just one.
Me: If it start to look like that, then that's completely wrong. Or the other ones is when people are doing that when they're on the call.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Me: I presume we're expecting Gary.
Them: I assume so. Don't know why we wouldn't be. He's even suggested 10, actually, didn't he? So.
Me: Yes, he did. No worries.
Them: I felt like. I'll join in a minute. What are you doing tomorrow? Then you're off as well, are you?
Me: Yeah, I'm. I'm finishing early tomorrow. Every now and again we go through the calendar and go right. We're booking that weekend. That weekend, that weekend, that weekend. Usually it's about a fortnight apart. We go away in the. In the campervan.
Them: Nice.
Me: It was the last one. Excuse me. The last one was the Langdales, where there's no Internet access at all, which is lovely.
Them: Yeah. Oh, perfect.
Me: So. Hi, gary.
Them: Hi, gary.
Me: 's borrowed James's houses. Behind him, his models.
Them: Now. This is the office. And James has moved. James has moved his things from home to here. So that's what's happened there. Anyway, Sorry teams. Took me a while to get going there. Oh, you're right. No worries.
Me: So it was. We were due to go away in the van this weekend, but my brother in law's got a beautiful house up in Grasmere and he's invited us up there for the weekend. So it would have been but walking distance into grass. We won't need to touch the car all weekend. Be nice. We've become old age punches. We get on the bus everywhere because the buses are fabulous, absolutely fabulous.
Them: Oh. Nice. Oh, how lovely. Nice. Perfect. Yeah. That knocked the bus. Good candy.
Me: But unlike the pensioners, we sit on the top deck and it's an open top bus no matter what weather. There's about four seats at the front. We're slightly covered and the rest is all open. It'd be a good weekend.
Them: Good. I'm glad.
Me: A weekend of excess.
Them: How are you, Gary? How was Thailand? Not spoken to you on the phone since. Not three now. It was very good. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was. It was everything and more. Plus, it was quite cheap. Although I felt like you were still working as part of it. I definitely got an email from you, but I'm kind of good at just going in for half an hour and just covering everything and then coming back out again. Yeah, yeah. Doing this, because that actually helps.
Me: You'd rather know, wouldn't you?
Them: Yeah, that helps me settle. To be honest with you, I. Then I'm not worrying about it, and then I'm. What I don't do is constantly checking my phone. No, just haven't allocated half an hour or so. Yeah, it's normally after you've had a nice day, chilled out. Yeah, yeah. To be honest with generally. I had a glass of pina colada in front of me and. And I was just checking the name, the dream.
Me: That was weird. That was weird to say.
Them: I know, and I'm not a fan. I've never really drunk them. And then suddenly we get out there and it's the drink to have.
Me: Brilliant.
Them: Okay? Nice.
Me: Do the cost of flights offset with the cost of the accommodation and food when you get there. Because that's always the eye Wall street bit, isn't it?
Them: Yeah, that's. It is, it's, it's a long old flight. Because it was, I mean, we would, I think we flew into Doha and changed there and it was just like two six and a half, two six, nine hours flight. So it was long. But yeah. It's expensive to get there, but. But then I think there was. Eight of us. And we are. So we didn't go all inclusive, which I normally do, but it just didn't seem worthwhile. And I was right not to, because we, you know, we were drinking most of the day. Drinking various things, and then in the evenings and everything else. And our entire barbell for the whole week was £450 for eight people. For 10 days. For 10 days?
Me: Just over 50 quid each. Wow.
Them: It was. It worked out about. 6 pound per person per day. Wow. And. And. And trust me, my son alone was drinking mocktails like they were going out of fashion.
Me: You pay 10 quid for Queena here?
Them: You know. You know what kids are like on holiday. Yeah, yeah. We worked out. It was about. It was about £1 20. £1 20 for a cocktail. Amazing. God, that was good. And that. That was the expensive place because that was in the hotel when we went out.
Me: Wow.
Them: Yeah, like that was like me and my brother in law went out and did. We went out for an entire evening for about a tener each, including dinner. Wow. And the food was so. Food was good. Nice.
Me: They came back the next morning.
Them: We? We only had one night out, thankfully.
Me: The rest were days out.
Them: Because. Because I was doing. I was. I was running. I was running in 94% humidity. It was very sweat, very sweaty. Yeah, it sounds it. Oh, no, but anyway. Well, I'm glad. That's great. Thank you. Good, good, good. Nice to have you back anyway. It's. Yeah, yeah, I've sort of jet lagged's gone now, so I'm good now. Good. Good, good. Right, where should we start today, then? Should we do the Pete, have you.
Me: I'll give you an update. Keep doing an update on the way I'm working at the Mark. I've vastly changed the way I'm working. I'm feeling slightly frazzled from it, I must admit. I've developed this last month, the last three, four weeks, a system which is an AI system to fully drag in everything about Debonshire that I'm aware of. So, for instance, this meeting, I think, presume everybody does it now. It's recorded, it'll be logged, the transcript will be kept and. Any action points from it will be saved as tasks. Any emails that we have, I do the same thing. I logged them. I see if there's any action points on them and then I can act on it. If this would be great if you could do this, if there's any brand guideline documents or documents you could share with me about marketing activity, anything. It might be that I find useful to incorporate in either my communication or the wording that we put down our adverts or do's and don'ts colors, you name it. If there's anything like that you can provide me, then that would be superb. And then I can put all that into. I can put all that into the system, and it just ensures that nothing falls between the gaps, really.
Them: What's the system being? Was there?
Me: I've written it.
Them: Oh, I see. It's like code.
Me: Yes. Yeah.
Them: Oh, I said, right. Okay. I thought you were, like, just talking about chat gbt. I was like.
Me: Well, it's claude. Well chat. GPT is an LLM, a large language model. I use claude and I use thing called claude code.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah.
Me: It's quite weird because I'm a programmer at heart. That's where my originally came from, when I came out of the Earth as a programmer. And years ago, I was using an operating system called unix. And now I'm looking at claw code, and it all runs on Unix. It's exactly the same commands as I used to use, like, 25, 30 years ago. So I'm developing email synchronization systems, tasking systems, and so on. But I'm also dragging in all the knowledge that I can on Google Ads, latest best practice news, and so on. I've set up a newsletter about the latest stuff. In Google Ads land, which I'm now putting on a blog on my website. I'm not asking people to look at it, it's more for SEO than anything else, but I do actually find it quite interesting. It's a real buzz, but it also means, as far as devices concerned, it means that we can really squeeze this. We can really get the most out of this from a granular viewpoint. So when you say, can you do an experiment like the figures are sent over to you the other day about click through rates and conversion rates. It's amazing what it actually uncovers, either positively or negatively. So we've just done the new landing page for the chats with. Chats with Cottages. I'm absolutely chucking that. And we'll be able to see the details of that in infinite detail. So that's what I've been working on. The slides you're going to look at. I'm developing them from within the AI. It's not a straightforward thing because it's a shared slides document and it's difficult to actually put them in. So I'm still cutting and pasting the actual images in and then putting my own commentary. Against it. So it's been a big thing. It's been like a 10 hour a day project to do all this. It's still under development, but it does mean we can keep an eye on things. Our text assets stale, should we be swapping them out and the benefit we're going to get. From this is it's just going to get better and better the account, both in terms of click through rate and conversion rate and I will be able to report back to you pretty much whatever you want. If there's anything you see today. I apologize for the slides today because they've changed completely from last month when I said, oh, I've just changed all the slides. They have actually changed again. But if there's anything in there that you would like to see that's not in there, then just. Please let me know and I'll make a note of it.
Them: Ok? Ay. Cool.
Me: Or something. I'll make a note of it anyway. But I will action it. So that's where I am. Just share my screen with you. So can you see that ok?
Them: Yep, yep.
Me: So you'd asked last time about the colors and stuff. So I've changed the colors. So the estate blue and the. Is it slate or something? The background. So it's a bit more in keeping with the brand.
Them: Good.
Me: So KPIs. So we were battling a little bit this month. The fact that September was brilliant. And it was brilliant from perspective of I think the hotel of the year massively helped and inflated both the revenue and the roas. They both are fantastic target. It lived off the back of that. If you look at the actual increase in revenue, 94% of it last month was due to the Cavendish and the Chatsworth Estate. Campaigns. So whilst these figures are down in terms of bookings, revenue and roas, they're off the back of a brilliant month last month, rather than being poor.
Them: Yeah, it'd be interesting to see the comparison to the month. Prior. And year on year. Yeah.
Me: Yes, I'll show you that. Those figures, I think actually looking at September against October, the Cavendish was. The revenue was down 45% and the chats with Inns was down 73% on September, which is disproportionate to everything else. All the other hotels were kept apace with where they're usually going to be, but those dropped. So that would indicate that it was actually the hotel of the year that was the main contributing factor for that. So if you took those out.
Them: Cool. Is there a way of on that P. Is there a way of knowing exactly what did cause the drop, rather than, like, assuming it's the hotel of the year just because we have seen a bit of actually a slower pickup for Cavendish for November, like, we're actually gonna be down for the first time.
Me: Ok?
Them: In November across the board. That's not just ppc, but, like, in general. For Cavendish, that is. So be interesting to know if you are able to pinpoint exactly why.
Me: Yeah, it's difficult, isn't it? Because all we can do is we can assume. Backed up with the stats, it's extraordinary that if you just look at those two campaigns, they are responsible for 94% of the decline. And this is in October.
Them: From the other side.
Me: And I suppose it's one thing I would comment. We're on the 13th of November now. We're halfway through the month.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I'm wondering whether it be possible to have this earlier in the month. Because if we action changes now, they wouldn't necessarily take full impact in November.
Them: It's just whether you've got time to pull the report, to be honest, from my side, more than happy to pull it forwards and do you know, do this the first week of the month.
Me: That would be good for me. I'd like that. Because I'm looking at numbers and then going, oh, yeah, we're halfway through the month now. It's like the hide. The numbers I got for the hide are different to what for October. So it's shown trajectory, it's going to be. A bit more. If we did it earlier, then it would be give us a clearer picture of what's happening right now rather than what happened last month.
Them: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's absolutely fine.
Me: I think the supposition about the Hotel of the Year, if it is just those two campaigns, it's a bit too much of a coincidence that they dropped so much and both of them had dropped round about the same amount for that period of time.
Them: So which is it? That straps are a Cavendish and.
Me: The Cavendish in the chats within. So the chats with Inns is about the Chapter escape type.
Them: Pillsley and Bailey.
Me: It's not specifically at a hotel. It's about the Chatsworth Estate hotels on the chats with this state. Let me flip through. So that's a summary of what we've just been. That was what we've just been talking about. So year on, year change. You can see for October, conversions were about the same. All the numbers. I mean the click through rate conversion rate is commensurate with September, despite that boost for chats with inns and the Cavendish and the Roas percentage change. So this is what makes me to conclusion there's nothing to be concerned about about the performance of the Google Ads campaigns.
Them: Yeah. Click through rates. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you say sorry, this just. On the. On this Sorry, we've put 24 versus 25.
Me: It's just. Yeah.
Them: Do you mean?
Me: The percentage change between the two years.
Them: October 24 versus October? Yeah. Yeah. So they 150% increase is from 24 to 25.
Me: Yeah. Sorry. Yes.
Them: Yeah, okay.
Me: Yeah. So green's got a road to bad. That's only really patronized. I didn't mean it that way. I'm sure you can sort that one out.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So then the absolute figures.
Them: Okay? Cool.
Me: 24 against 25. You can see conversions are conversion rate up, but these are the absolutes rather than the percentage change between the two years.
Them: Yeah. Okay? Okay?
Me: So looking pretty healthy. And the seasonal trends are matching last year. If you look at the seasonal seasonal context. September to October in 2024. We saw a 22% drop. In revenue. And this year we're seeing a similar amount. So we will see these seasonal trends, and this is reflecting those trends from year on year in a percentage term. So again, there's a drop, but it's a seasonal drop.
Them: Yeah. So it's the same similar kind of thing last year.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Except click through rate was. Yeah, a bit. Much bigger drop last year. Yeah.
Me: Yeah. And no particular reason for that in October last year. It's nice to see that we're maintaining that click through rate, I think. Sorry. Gary.
Them: There is. There is a reason for the October last year's click through rate looking so terrible. We. We changed. We changed stuff on the website so a load of the tracking was missing.
Me: Right, okay. Okay?
Them: So. So it's artificial. It's. It'll look work we only for about two weeks of it. So that sort of makes sense. So it's sort of. If you, if you double that look consistent.
Me: Yeah, yeah.
Them: Which site is this, though? Is this chat's web escape? So is this.
Me: This is the hotel. So I'll put at the bottom here what they to give it clarification what we're looking at. This is the main hotel properties, excluding the hide.
Them: So that could be. So this time last year though, there was both. Devanja Hotel's website. And there was chats with escapes live. Yes. So then this time around, the blue line, 2025, is that. I'm assuming that's been Bolton Abbey. Escapes and chats with escapes. Yeah.
Me: Yes.
Them: Yeah. Okay?
Me: And this is click through.
Them: And it was. And.
Me: Sorry. I was gonna say would it affected the click through rate? Though.
Them: Because we weren't we? Oh, yes. Actually, no, possibly not.
Me: It would go back the conversion rate, but not necessarily effect.
Them: Conversion. Right. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It's a good point. Okay? Okay? Cool.
Me: Again. More. I've put all this. Obviously, I'm doing the commentary on it, but I've also done a summation of it in the slides because I don't know whether you look over these afterwards. It just clarifies, okay.
Them: No. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: And if you. If you need any more clarification, then just give me a shout. I say any deficiencies at all, then I can address it. So that's the individual hotel performance as a whole, both in the PMAX and in search. We'll move on to the beeline. The pills here in a minute. About pmax, but it's maintaining where we wanted it to be. There was an increase in target row last month to 570, so. The expectation was all the target was 570. It exceeded the target for Devonshire and the Cavendish. Now the reason for increasing the target ROAS was to hit the expectation for the budget. So the budget went down last month.
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: So in order to hit the budget, I can either. Well, I did two things. I'd reduced the daily budget and I increased the target roas so it had to work hard to get where it went to. And yeah, Devon should just smashed it as usual.
Them: Yeah, well, we increase the budget for Dave, though, as well. I didn't know.
Me: Yes, we did. Yes, we did. I sent you the stats through on that, didn't I? Okay.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: And then. So this is the profitability as reflected in the previous table. It's nice to have a top six now. So chats with escapes at the bottom there obviously was. The presumption is it's been affected by the award and Devonshire holding strongly. 8:57 Roys is awesome. So we've got this ongoing situation with.
Them: Sorry. Could you just go back one on that one? So here, where we've got. Top4 is Devon J Hotel's Cavendish fell mid tier properties. B Lee pulls Lynn and he got chance of escapes hotels. What's that? What campaign is that one? That chats with escapes hotels.
Me: Chapter six. That's his states. So there's Chatsworth Estates. So it goes through.
Them: So cottages.
Me: To. No, no, the hotels. But the campaign is aimed towards search terms about Chatsworth Escapes hotels.
Them: So. Okay, so that one doesn't specifically talk about the individual hotels that are above. It just talks about the general. Okay, general. So it would be things like what would be kind of within that is this.
Me: Correct. Yeah. Pubes in chat with chats with his state hotels.
Them: Okay? Okay? Okay? And that's. That's a paid search campaign rather than performance. Mac, right? Okay.
Me: The only ones we can do the pmax on our actual hotels.
Them: Themselves. But then you do have a hotel's campaign, don't you? For performance, Max, which they're all in.
Me: No. Well, I have a. I have. So I have a PMAX campaign which is all the hotels. It doesn't include the hide at the moment. I probably won't do. No. So within there you have asset groups. We have five asset groups which relate to the individual hotels, which contain the assets, text and images and. Search themes related to that hotel.
Them: Yeah. Now. Of course, we can't do the hide, can we? Yeah. And you pull that information through.
Me: Well, from the hotel.
Them: The existing paid search campaigns, because that's the one I queried was about the the Fell Hotel for.
Me: No, no. Yes. It's keywordless.
Them: The yes.
Me: It's keyword list, so it relates to specific searches for that hotel and maybe its facilities, its location and so on. So it's a black box kind of thing. Pmax I have control on it in terms of which search themes and what kind of audiences that it goes out to. But in the main, it's keywordless. I can see some of the search terms that actually far off for it. So set the details of the ones for the fell. It is actually targeting the fell and because it has a fel asset group.
Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah. So this is my concern with the bell, and I know you've said that like, and you know, please do challenge me on this one, but it's because all our paid activity, not all, but a lot, is talking about Devon Jeffel. And that doesn't exist anymore. It's now just the fell.
Me: Yep.
Them: When do we get to the point where we just switch off Devon Chevelle and it would just become the Fell? Because my concern is that are those. Is the brand the Fel Hotel stronger now and people know that's what we are. So that when they see an ad for Devel, they don't relate the two. Do you know what I mean? So, because we've seen such a decline for the Fel Hotel lately. And if we're actively pushing out ads that talk about Deval, is that not confusing the message? Rather than capitalizing on a search like waning search volume, essentially. I think we need to find. We need to look at the. What? The what? The search volume. Search volume is for DemonstraFL versus the FEL. Don't we? Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Me: We're. Not. I mean, we're. We're talking two different things, really. Or I'm understanding, two different things. One is the actual search terms that people are using. If they want to use the Devonshire fellow, then that's fine. Like, let them use the W. Charlie, that they can find it with it. The other one. Is the actual message.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And the message is given by the text assets which are on the ad, and there's 15 of them. There's 15 headlines on there. One of them says the Devonshire fell, and that is likely to appear to somebody who's looking for the Devonshire fell. So there's an exact match between the. Two of them. There are other bits of the assets which just say they fell.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: So we're not. We're not necessarily promoting the Davan Chefel. We're promoting what people want to look for and what they want to.
Them: So if people are not searching heavily for the DaVinci fill, it'll naturally, within the campaign, start showing it less and less anyway.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it will be it.
Them: So it's not like if someone was looking for the Fel Hotel and then we showed them Devonshire Fell instead. Is that the point?
Me: Will be. Yes. Yeah.
Them: Okay, okay.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And is so that's so that obviously, from most paid search ad point of view, I completely get that. Like, you know, in terms of capturing that kind of search volume, and we've still got brand equity and the search term devel, etc. But then what about the PMAX campaigns? Cause that's the bit I'm not really a Fae on, so I don't really understand, like, those. So it's the same thing. Even though we're like, more. Because that, for me, is always my understanding that we're more, like, from a brand point of view.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's, like, pushing out kind of more of, like, across different platforms.
Me: Yeah, it's pulling more than pushing.
Them: Okay?
Me: What it's doing is it's pulling what the searcher is looking for and showing them the assets which relate to that type of search or what they think they're actually looking for. So if someone searches for the dev and she fell in, a pmax campaign appears. Then they will potentially be shown Devonshire Fell text asset. It works the same way I take the I take the ad text from the search campaign and put that into the asset group. It's the same text because it would craft a search ad from it. When the additional bit with the PMAX is it goes out to other channels as well, such as displaying Gmail. And again, it's looking at context of what people are searching for. Uses an intelligent matching kind of thing.
Them: Okay? Yeah. Okay? Okay? So your recommendation is to keep Devon Jeffel in. Even though we're seeing. That won't be a detriment to kind of.
Me: It has one text headline for Devin Chefel at 15.
Them: Yeah. But when I looked in the PMAX campaign, it didn't. It was quite a lot more.
Me: Oh, this is great. So my mouse has just died.
Them: So that's. That's many queried, you know, I mean, I'm just. I'm conscious of, like, the challenge that we're having around Brand at the moment. For the Fel Hotel, and we've seen a decline. For organic search, that is. But. If we're seeing a decline, is it because we. Have establishing more brand for Devan Jeffel. Do you know what I mean? Are we kind of.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. This isn't a branding exercise. This is intent based marketing.
Them: I know, but, like, can you see what I'm saying?
Me: This is what people want. No, I don't.
Them: I don't know. Am I making this? I don't know.
Me: No, I'm sorry. It's my misunderstanding. No, I don't. Because this is intent based marketing. Someone is actively going on the web and looking for something and we're giving them that thing that they're looking for, the pmax. They are showing intent for that kind of thing, not to say through the keywords.
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: So it might have been from previous activity they got searching for the hotel. So we're not going go to the Devonshire fell, even though they put the fell in. It's just going to show them what the sort of thing they're looking for. And you've look at the click through rates they resonate with that the click through rates are going through the roof because we're showing the click through rates will go through the roof because the ad is reflecting what people are actually searching for.
Them: Yeah. So at what point do we. Yeah, I get. I get that. So what? At what point do we turn off. Devan chafell.
Me: What our concern whenever you want. But what specifically do you want me to turn off?
Them: Because we can't do it forever.
Me: Because we wouldn't want to. I would never do a negative search term for the Devin she fell because that would suddenly just wipe out high intent traffic.
Them: I think it's just. Yeah. And that's the bit he's like, I just feel like there's going to be. At some stage, there has to be, like, an extraction plan around it. Otherwise, we're just kind of using. I know, obviously, if the volume is there, then fair enough. But I guess my ask is, like, at what point do we pull back from the Devon and just focus on the vowel? Can I. As a suggestion? I think. I think it's less of a PPC exercise in the sense we. At some point we might say, I think that decision needs to be made outside of Pete and. But what I'll do is I'll talk to a CMG and get them to do some analysis. And we can track it. And for your benefit, then, Helen. We can look for that. We can look for that trigger point where we think. You know what? It's, it's, it's. It's. It's turning off so much that actually there's no point. And that's it. We don't want to, like, not have. You know, I'm not saying, oh, let's just, you know, why are we doing it? Because I completely understand why it's there, because the volume is there, but. It's just like, I think when I'm seeing kind of a decline in searches for the Fel Hotel. Then my, my query was like, oh, is that. Is that because I don't know. People are saying the Devel. Still seeing it. They go, oh, maybe I don't want to say, maybe I will search for Devan Jafel because I've just seen it. Do you know what I mean? It's? Just like I'm not. I'll be honest. I think it's on. I think it's unlikely if you search for the spell hotel. And you suddenly saw a Devon jfel one you then research for the demonstrate fair? I think it's unlikely, but. But I can but that's something that they could look at. We have a look at that sort of thing. Thank you. So I've made a note. I've made a note to ask them to do a little bit of exercise this month. On it. Yeah. Great. Okay, cool. Thank you. Cool. Okay.
Me: Just as a very quick. I'll just look at the last 30 days. For searches for DaVinci. Fell. None.
Them: Cool.
Me: In the PMAX campaign. There's been no searches for Devonshire foul in the last 30 days.
Them: Okay?
Me: I'm a bit loath to do these on the spot, but. No, but that seems to be. And if you think last 30 days on the fell, it's had a 713%.
Them: Now. No, don't do it now. It's.
Me: Roas. And the assets themselves. There's only one headline with the Devonshire fell in it. And none of. The none of the description lines have. Devon sheffell. The outward facing bit of the add in PMAX. The only bit of that is one headline out of 15 that says the Devonshire fell. So if it makes you feel comfortable, I can take that out.
Them: No, it's not. It's not that. It's not good. The point I'm trying to make, it's not, like, my discomfort. It's not that. Like, it's more. I'm just. I just want to know, like, if that. If there was a point where we just need to. Kind of pull back on Devan Jebel because it's having a detrimental effect on, you know, us being able to really run with the Fel Hotel. But if the volume is there and we're getting the clicks through from that, and we're getting the sale through from that, more importantly, that's. Fine. I think. I just don't want it to be at the detriment of being able to build out the newer brand. It's the long term brand, like I say. That's why I think. I think we can do some separate analysis to have a look at that. That's fine, yeah.
Me: Yeah. I get it.
Them: Go on to the next bit. Move on.
Me: I'm like a dog with a barrel. Now, just a very quick.
Them: No, no. Pete. Pete. Pete. Move on. Come on, it's fine.
Me: I'm curious. Now, though. Ok?
Them: Now, Sage, your curiosity after the call.
Me: Onwards. So this ongoing issue of the Beeley and the pills, I can't tell you enough how I'm on with this. I'm contacting Google on a regular basis. They tell me that they're looking at it. It's been escalated to the hotel's people.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And nothing's happened. I've emailed them again at the beginning of this week. I've got a note to email them again at the end of the week. So I'm pushing it. I actually think that nobody actually knows what's happened. And unfortunately, we're not in control of this. I can't manually change this landing page URL. They have to go and do it.
Them: I. Know.
Me: And because technically we're not integrated into them the way in which they want us to be integrated. Because this was done on a beta, the pmax integration was done on a beta, and they said, oh, we'll do it. So they did do it.
Them: Y.
Me: And I don't have any access to what they've done, so all I can say is I'm pushing it. The Billy and the Pills is still being covered by the search campaigns, so we're still getting coverage on them. It's just we're not getting the PMAX coverage and looking back at historically. The pills in the Beeley weren't the ones that were performing the best on pmax.
Them: Eah, no.
Me: So.
Them: It's not. It's not as big a loss as it would be on a different hotel.
Me: Correct. So this is location. So this is where we're actually targeting a location. The chats within hotels is slightly different. This is actually location. So this is places where targeting rather than actual hotels. So chats with escape locations or Walton, Abby escapes locations. So hotels in Derbyshire, hotels in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, all those kind of. Things. This is what this is targeting. This is the Bobby one is the one I really need to dive into because it is underperforming. It's been underperforming for a while. So work needs to be done on that. That might be a landing page.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I don't know. I don't know.
Them: Is there cottages within that one as well?
Me: This isn't self, coach.
Them: So nothing for like cottages in Bolton Abbey escapes notches in Barton Harvey or anything like that.
Me: No connect all that. It's specific hotels.
Them: It's just hotels, okay?
Me: So that's work to be done. To improve that.
Them: Yeah. I wonder if there's anything like for that one. Whether because I'm in the chats with There's a lot more clout than Bolton Abbey. I can just in general, I wonder if there's anything.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Instead there. I mean, what about kind of more of like a national park focus around Yorkshire Dales?
Me: I've done the peak district, I've done the dales.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's a big old list of places whether I'll look back over the last 12 months and see what this is doing. They've only been split out fairly recently. These ad groups discriminate between chats with Escape and Bolton Abbey Escapes. But I can look back on those ad groups and see where there's any sort of trend at all towards certain areas and push them a little bit more. But it's 500 quid out of that budget that's gone towards it. So it needs to be addressed. It's been kind of dragging on for a while, this, with the restructure, it's got a bit hidden. So now's the time to do something about that and see. We then get to that. The same row as the Chatsworth escapes one. So that's on the plan for this week. Sorry? For this month. So the hide. So hide started 10th of October. That's the roas for October. It was always going to happen. There's a learning period for that. It's still using a lot of the keywords from the original Highwayman. To mention the fact of the Premier in. Yeah, there was always going to be a bit of a slow takeup. The conversion tracking.
Them: And yeah, Andy say like tracking wasn't properly in place from. Can we have a date, Gary? From what exactly what day it was?
Me: Yeah.
Them: It was up and running.
Me: I put early in November there, but I'm not sure about that, Gary.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, I'd be good just to have an exact day, wouldn't it?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Thank you. I'll get it, and I'll update the slide with that information on it.
Me: Lovely.
Them: Amazing. Thank you.
Me: So, yeah, you might have to tell me about that. So it's an image there. Gary. Sorry. If you let me know, I can regenerate that image and put it on.
Them: Okay? Cool. Yeah, yeah, nice problem.
Me: The monthly trend. I've just put impressions and CTR on here to start off with. I don't think the conversions were overly relevant at this stage. So October's when it all started. Impressions. Because we're spending more money on it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It was also an increase in click through rate.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Which was encouraging.
Them: Y. Eah, that's all fine as long as it's going in the right direction. No one's expecting.
Me: Yeah. And. Just did a quick piece on.
Them: While he's doing that. How is hyde generally, helen? It's good currently because of Christmas markets, so weekends were pretty much, like, sold out. We all set on Wednesday? Had our highest revenue midweek, so that was kind of so far today, so it's definitely getting there. We've had tons of press coverage come out now, so I think that's definitely helping. We had the Times. We've got a load more press days coming up, so we've got kind of like Waitrose in. We've got the sun, the Metro all due, like, stays. So actually, from like, a. Brand point of view, we do kind of expect that we'll just continue, you know, in terms of actually getting the brand out there, which it will do through that. So, yeah, it's doing okay. The challenge we're having is staff. So the existing staff were retained from Beefy. Today's when it was run as a premier in. So we're having quite a lot of negative feedback about food. Just in terms of it being very hit and miss. So when you know Adam exec Shepp is there. Brilliant. When it has, like, one of his right hand men there. Great. But we're getting very up and down, so quite a lot of negative reviews in the last couple of weeks. Just where it's been really, really busy and then actually. Haven't been able to resort it properly. The other challenge we're having is we only take walk ins. So from a staffing point of view, that makes it very hard to resource. So the guys have no idea how many people are coming through the door on an evening for, like restaurant. But board wise in terms of accommodation, it's doing okay. And most people do tend to eat there as well because it's out on a limb, you can't walk anywhere from there. So actually like it's kind of a captive audience unless they got in their car and once somewhere else. So it does. Have that. I mean, I was there on Monday and Tuesday this week. And it was good. It was busy. It was. You know, it was good. But then I ran into customers who complained right at me, who didn't know who I was, but they were like, worst hotel of my life. As I was, as I was checking in. So I was like, Okay, great.
Me: I definitely don't work here.
Them: Yeah, well, I had to fess up, unfortunately, but that wasn't great. So. Yeah, it's just a bit. It's a little bit hit and miss, I'd say. I mean, bookings wise, we're doing okay. It's just. Yeah. Whether the team are able to efficiently service it, it's culturally very different what you want to achieve compared to what it was before. Yeah, I mean, that's going to take a while. The other thing we're finding is this obviously is our first, you know, affordable accommodation and, you know, restaurant, really. But because it's under the chats with Escapes umbrella, people expect chats with service and actually it isn't affordable place. The rooms are under. Under £100 a night. So there's almost like an expectation that it should be better, but then from our side, we're like, well, no, because that's the value of it. Like, it is. It's not a Cavendish. So there's a little bit of that where, you know, we know we're never going to be. Able to do anything about that, because it's just kind of. Are people going to have that expectation? But actually, we're not. We're never going to be a Cavendish. It's not going to be like that. It is an affordable accommodation, but there's still this. There's some basics that need to be addressed, but, you know, they're doing what they can for now, but we still need to. Get the volume in. It's not going to stop our marketing. We still need to. You know, resign to get people there.
Me: You can see why people like Ibis and the Hilton actually do these graded things like the Ibis Budget and Ibis Premier. And you can see why they do that because it's shoving in people's face. Don't expect to get super duper service budget because it's a budget hotel, but you can't really do that with the hide, can you?
Them: Good. Yes. Yeah. But. But they still. But they're still trading off. They. But they still trade off the Hilton. They still trade off the Ibis name, though, don't they, to get people in, which is sort of what we're doing, really, with Chasmov Escape, so. Exactly. Yeah, definitely.
Me: Do. Chats with budget being and any headline that I do.
Them: No. We're certainly. Could you imagine Rachel's face if you suggested it, Helen? No, I mean, like, affordable is pretty much the limit of what we can do. We certainly can't do cheap. We can't do anything like that. Brilliant. Okay.
Me: Chats with slightly less middle class. I know. It's a bit too long that, though, isn't it?
Them: Anyway, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Me: Yeah, I just found the biggest to hide. The roas has improved since the beginning of the month. Interestingly enough, on the small number of conversions there being, the value has gone up. It might be just one of them that's done it, but the average Booking value was £510, so that's multiple. Days that people are booking. Whether that's the start of a trend or not, I don't know. But. So that's what I'm seeing at the start. So heading the right way now. The conversion's in. It should make the world a difference.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It begs the question. Sorry. Were you going to say something?
Them: Oh.
Me: Sorry. So it begs the question on budget, really, for the hide. We're continuing with the 2,000 pound a month budget for the high.
Them: No. Yeah.
Me: I'm going to pull this into the main reporting for the hotels from now on, but I will continue this level of reporting on the HIDE as part of it. But on the tables, you'll see the HIDE as part of that. It's going to continue as a search campaign in its own right. So that will be from next month. Is this graph going to be useful for you? Is there, are there other stats that you would prefer to see on it? Rather impressions in ctr, even the conversions, the bookings, if we take this back to the high woman, they weren't huge numbers on there. Which is why I picked on CTR and Impressions as a guide to how often the ads are being seen and what sort of response they're getting from them. But I can add or swap these around if you want to.
Them: This is fine for now and then, let's just say. Yeah. Still early days, isn't it?
Me: Open up. Ok, so these are the self catering campaigns. So the Russian cottage in the hunting tower have been paused. As requested. Don't really know what to say about this. And we've got Yorkshire Cottage. You actually had a conversion last month. We're hoping, then, that these are going to be influenced by the experiment that's been run on them now.
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: So that would hopefully will make a difference. I've looked at the numbers for this month. It's too soon yet. It'd be four to six weeks before we actually see anything on there. But at least the nice thing is something positive is being done about it. And if we can already again, it's off the chats with name chats. With self catering chats with estate cottages. We're still getting a decent kind of roas on those. Anyway, if the challenge is to build the rest of it up, One of my challenges is that in October that spent £1,000.
Them: That's fine. Yeah.
Me: And that comes out of the monthly budget. So the base monthly budget for last month was 9,000. So it was 8,000 on the call hotels and a thousand on self catering. I'm now going to. Do that separately and say, right, there's always going to be £1,000 going towards self catering, so at least it gives you the opportunity to say, no, well, let's increase the exposure of that separately to what's happening with the core hotels. So the reporting will reflect that next month. Weddings. Exclusively venues and that's it.
Them: Oh, great. Thank you.
Me: Sorry. You've expressed the wedding. The weddings is something that's been worked on. I don't know what else.
Them: Yeah, it is.
Me: Yeah, I don't know else I can report on that.
Them: Big time on that one. I will be curious on the weddings once we've got the. The new caldera in place, because that's when you can make proper, full inquiries rather than just clicking on a link. That'd be really interesting. Yeah, well, I've asked Cordero as well, just to have once. It's still no. Still no word on that, by the way, Gary. But once I have to like rushing me, like. I'm glad it was. I'm glad they pushed you. It was such a priority for you. I was so bunis. Literally. They would came. I'd get people messaging me every other day. When's it going live? When's it going live? I have a weekly meeting with the ops director, and he was like, we're paying for this now and needs to go live. Helen. I was like, I'm trying, like, can't. I can't ask anymore. Like, can't work any quicker. So, you know when it went live, and he's like, he literally ran through to the office. Well, why is it live? That bit on Caldera doesn't work. I'm like, it's not my problem. You told me to get it live, I got it live, honestly. And then I knew it would happen while I was away as well, because James was just like it could seem. I could almost feel in his emails, he's frustration. I was fuming. It's just like, yeah, very, very irritating. And then Cordero has since now been pretty crap. So the guy, that Charlie guy, is now no longer there. Oh, God. So it's just all very. And I was like, you just sort that out. I was like, when you're ready, we can put it back on. But, yeah, switching it back on is nice and easy. It's a hard. Yeah. At least it's done. But, yeah, no, thank you. And I just say to James, I was like, thank you. What a mess. But, yeah, weddings. We now have Kelsey and Isabelle. Look after weddings and they are pretty much refreshing, revitalizing all the offering. So everything is being looked at. I mean, they wanted to take everything off the website the other day, and I was like, no, let's not do that for SEO. Let's not do that. But.
Me: Right.
Them: They want to try and avoid doing any pre built packages. So that might change a few things because of Cordero. But we are working as a deaf day. Going to revitalize all of their brochures. So we're going to rewrite those. We'll have a bit more of an understanding around, kind of like the key messages. Because at the moment I was like, we don't know. We're just kind of pushing things out based on what's? Been run for ages. But, you know, we definitely need to optimize, but also conscious of changing too much all at once because you don't know what's made the difference. Exactly. So I've said that we're going to do it a little bit more phased, at least, kind of get, you know, some of the brochure rewritten, we'll get some of the third parties updated, we'll get our own website sorted, and then we can look at, you know, the next bit. I will get there. I'll keep you posted on plans, but. And timings for that, because then, yeah, PPC will fall in, but it'll be once we've got everything sorted, so, yeah, we'll work on that and I'll let you know.
Me: We can do. We'll do an asset text refresh and images when that happens. Great. Ok.
Them: Interest in. Yeah. Yeah, it'll be everything.
Me: Well, what a difference it made on the rest of them.
Them: I know. It was good, wasn't it? Yeah, it was good. Even just keeping it fresh, isn't it?
Me: So, yeah, brilliant.
Them: So that's good. But. Yeah, I don't think there's much else, really.
Me: Sorry to go over El Gran, but Lismer on the hall. What's actually happening with those now?
Them: I don't look after those ones. The best I can tell you is that when I spoke to Rachel, just before I went away, I said, so now we've gone through the. Now we've done the hide. When did we start, Lisbon? She said in the next couple of months, but then I don't. Think. And I know you're not close to Eva, Helen, but she might not know either. But right now I don't think they have actually decided if it's going to fall into one of the existing hotels or we're going to create. The last conversation was basically, there's going to be a Liz More Escapes type thing, because there's other things around Lismore, not just. Yeah, so there's. So we're going to create effectively a Liz More escaped version. And the hall was then going to probably drop into in Bolton that escapes, so.
Me: Ok?
Them: That's probably still the plan, but. Yeah, it is. That's still the plan. All those things will still happen. It's just timelines aren't 100% yet. There's also a lot of resourcing that needs to be done for Liz more to even really kind of get that off. The ground. And then the hall is quite an interesting one because it will come under Bolton Abbey escapes at some point. But again, it's very close to the family, that one in particular, so there's a lot more. Quite responsible for the current website, the Liz Moran hall website, the content that's on it. Doesn't naturally fit into Bolton Abbey escapes. In terms of the structure. We'd have to have a real think about how we do that structurally in the use of experience, so that there's a real danger of flooding the Bolton Abbey escape site when the hall goes on it and losing the focus on the other hotels. Would probably be my chief concern. I know it's obviously Devon. Cheers. So Devin, she's got his own asset credibility anyway. But I would just content wise we could have a problem from that point of view. It's the same reason that I've personally never been a big fan of the idea of putting Bolton Abbey into Bolton Abbey escapes either, because I think it might kill it. Yeah. I'd rather just do a brand new fresh site for bottlenebby and link and then have better linkage between the two sites. But TVC isn't it? Yeah. Ok, cool. And then the other. The other thing is. Which is not official. Official yet. So this is NDA territory. That is caravan sites.
Me: Everyone gets closer to their screen now.
Them: That is caravans.
Me: Woo. Hoo. Fantastic.
Them: We are in the process. Of acquiring Caravan park, which is currently looking like we would control everything from the end of September with Go Live October.
Me: No.
Them: But we will need a site before then. Well, we'll need integration onto chats with escapes. Before then so that people we can start taking bookings. For post october. So that might be. Maybe march time. But keep you posted on timelines and budgets, obviously.
Me: That's my wheelhouse. That's my wheelhouse.
Them: Oh, is it? Yeah.
Me: Well, I've got the camper van. We stayed on the pop up.
Them: Pete's Peter Caravan, man. Oh, I see. Sorry. I thought you meant, like, another client or something. I was. Oh, great.
Me: No. We stayed on the pop up site during the fair. And the guy two doors down, he's got a motorhome. He stayed on that caravan site. He's really nice. He literally just walking through the wall into the estate. It's beautiful.
Them: It's always full. Should be an easy one. Yeah, it should be. Yeah, it should be. Should help us.
Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Nice, okay?
Them: Oh, good. Cool. All right. Nice one. Lovely. I don't think there's anything else. I don't think. But, yeah, thank you for that.

Me: I sent that email to you yesterday.
Them: Yeah. Having to read that. I've not read that one yet.
Me: So there's budgets to be implemented. I've actually got a task running every. I've got a task for nearly every Thursday, which looks at the performance over the last seven days and does some suggestions for budget changes. So I'll be a lot more proactive with that.
Them: All right. Yeah, you have. I've got. I've got meat invested. Omg. In an hour. Once I've done that, I'll finish off the report and send it over to you. Thank you. Actually, not heard from them. So, for instance, that call actually. So I. I don't know if there's stuff that's due to be sent over or if they're waiting on anything, but not heard anything since they're call. Okay?

Me: Bye. Bye.
Them: Bye.
