- 'Me: Yes. Why are we still having this problem with the product feeds location?
  My understanding is that the Christmas Eve sale was UK only. Double check this.
  Normally for Christmas delivery. All right. Mate. There we go.'
- 'Them: I''m not going to say it. There we go.'
- 'Me: Hello. It''s just ready for the. Ready for Christmas. Mate. I''m just wasted.
  Absolutely wasted.'
- 'Them: It''s only one I can look.'
- 'Me: I know. It''s been a bit of a roller coaster, this, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yep. What is this?'
- 'Me: We''re getting there, though, mate. It''s looking promising.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Good on new customers again.'
- 'Me: Is it? Oh, that''s good.'
- 'Them: It''s got to be the non brand stuff. Because the key difference year on year
  is the mix between brand and non brand sperm, particularly in the uk.'
- 'Me: Right. Right, okay.'
- 'Them: So new customers. From non brand paid search was up 64% versus last year.'
- 'Me: Lovely. Wow.'
- 'Them: Not bad.'
- 'Me: Yeah, well, the icing on the cake will be to hit the revenue target. Then.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Fingers crossed on that one.'
- 'Them: Quite. And it''s going to be. Hard. Tricky now until christmas eve.'
- 'Me: Yeah, this morning. I''ve reduced the budgets. I''m keeping my powder dry.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So the whole thing is spending two grand a day at the moment. And then the
  strategy is. Let me just get.'
- 'Them: What is in all accounts. Or account.'
- 'Me: So. Two grand today, three grand tomorrow. So as soon as. Sorry. Two grand
  today, two grand tomorrow. Three grand on. Christmas eve. I''ll probably leave it
  at three grand for Christmas Day. And then we''re up to 10 on Boxing Day. And then
  we''re just going to basically piss the budget away. From that point onwards, whatever''s
  left.'
- 'Them: S.'
- 'Me: Will be allocated. I''ve done two changes today.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''d already scheduled some changes to take it down to 2k, but I''ve done a
  bit of jiggling around because the diaries have started kicking quite dramatically.
  So I''ve just shifted money within accounts towards the diaries because they''re
  starting to get a decent roas. But there are assets for P9. They''re fantastic.
  6, 39 for the UK, 9, 48 for the US, 8, 78 for Europe and 5, 54 for the rest of the
  world. So that''s a blended roas of 7:56 for p9. Which is. Yeah, I never would have
  thought it.'
- 'Them: With no double conversion counting either.'
- 'Me: That''s correct. Yeah, that''s correct. Yes, it does make a difference, doesn''t
  it? When this kicks in. Some of those. Will go up to. Let''s just see. So boxing
  day last year. Was 1, 200 for the uk, 1600 to the us. 2,900 for Europe and Bristol
  wasn''t in the game. So if we can get just anywhere near that, then we''ve hit the
  target.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it was a good week overall as well.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Certainly from online. I don''t know about stores.'
- 'Me: Well. It was taking stuff down at the beginning of the week was the worry,
  because the UK didn''t seem to be doing very well. But there seems to be a lot of
  last minute traffic. I pulled it down today. We talked about it didn''t with it,
  probably from today it will drop. And looking at the conversion rates from last
  year, that bears the whole thing out. So rather than throw money at stuff that''s
  not going to convert as well, might as well just pull our horns in and wait for
  the big bang.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: As far as. The assets are concerned. So you''re going to have the. Do you think
  by the end of today, the text assets will be done?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Today. Text assets be done and. The creatives will be uploaded to all
  of the accounts.'
- 'Me: Okay? So then they''ll just need allocating to the individual campaigns.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Which I presume that I''ll just do on christmas eve. Because obviously,
  I presume, once you hit save, they''ll start serving.'
- 'Me: As soon as you''re. What you can do is you can load them up into the Asset
  Studio asset library, the main one for each account. So then when you go into the
  individual campaigns and select them, that''s when they start showing, so you can
  actually upload the creative.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''ll do that today.'
- 'Me: First. Great. Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''ll put it into the folders to that end of the library.'
- 'Me: Brilliant.'
- 'Them: And then what I''ll do is I will start putting them in about an hour, putting
  them live about an hour before I think we''re going to go.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Them: Because it''s going to take. Bit of time anyway.'
- 'Me: They won''t serve instantly.'
- 'Them: No. And even if they do, it''s going to be the odd person that will see it
  and it doesn''t matter.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And it''s not going to be the key thing. It''s not going to be someone who''s
  shopping in the store. The chances someone in the UK seeing the PMAX asset while
  they''re shopping in the store.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so just try and get myself some favors.'
- 'Me: Just say this Hallucinating or something? And what they''re going to do about
  it. Start the rebound. Is it?'
- 'Them: Well, no, it''s just part of life, so.'
- 'Me: They''re in the store because they''ve gotten to buy their wife''s present
  and they need something there and then, don''t they?'
- 'Them: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Otherwise, why are you shopping solo and Christmas
  Eve?'
- 'Me: Y. Es.'
- 'Them: Lose it. Yes, that''s fine. So all text assets should be done today. Everything
  uploaded into the libraries today. That''s another thing. I have got a markdown
  list for you if you want to do. A promo. Not code base, though.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Great. Okay?'
- 'Them: If it matters. Mark. Down.'
- 'Me: Get that loaded today and get it ready.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Cool. What I''ll do is I''ve got an Excel sheet I''ll put it into.
  Last time, isn''t it? You said attachment. Enough.'
- 'Me: The Excel spreadsheet''s fine. I can work for them. I just save it as a copy.
  Because it''s your SharePoint Excel, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Cool. All right. Now I just won''t do it on the web version,
  so I think that was didn''t work. Fine. So I''d get that sent over.'
- 'Me: Could you also send me the sale URL?'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, I''ll do that. Now.'
- 'Me: Because I''m going to create a promotion extension for it. Which is a winter
  sale. 50% off selected lines. So 50% up to 50% off selected styles. Sorry. Styles
  it is.'
- 'Them: Up to. Yeah, I''m just going to send you all the. Europe we don''t need at
  the minute.'
- 'Me: Still started catching up. Yet.'
- 'Them: I don''t think so.'
- 'Me: It''s not a last minute job, then it''s not shifted. When the peak is right,
  it''s just not coming. Right.'
- 'Them: It''s just more miserable. For them, I think.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So I think this is. Okay? So that''s fine. That''s fine. Yeah. So I guess
  with Europe, we just don''t do anything really until the 6th. As we just kind of.'
- 'Me: Well, that''s what I wanted to confirm. You.'
- 'Them: Sits.'
- 'Me: At 6:00 on the 24th. We''ve got everything. But we got uk, US and rest of world
  going into sale. Right, okay. For some reason, I''ve not got that written down.
  Anyway, it doesn''t make any difference. That''s fine. So the assets are going to
  change for those three regions.'
- 'Them: Yeah, and I believe. The European websites are just going to stay in their
  current Christmassy themes anyway.'
- 'Me: Okay? But they''ll use that sale. That sale URL be live.'
- 'Them: Europe. They''ll just get a holding page if anyone in Europe tries to search
  for sale. So basically we just won''t touch the Europe account, apart from probably
  to just. If we can obviously reallocate. Steadily reallocate budget, then great.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Otherwise.'
- 'Me: That''s exactly what I''m doing. There''s all sorts of shuffling around going
  on.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Otherwise we don''t need to touch Europe between now and the sixth,
  to be honest. I put all the tech assets in there anyway.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Just so it''s ready, but, yeah, there''s nothing to be done.'
- 'Me: So US, UK, row live, 4 o''clock on the 24th. So that''s obviously regardless
  of time zone, really, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: On bgmt. It''ll just be when Seb gives us the nod, which is normally between
  4 and 6.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: But as I say,'
- 'Me: It''s like the teacher saying, when you can go home. The guy opposite me is
  an assistant head, and it''s his job to say what time the kids can go on the last
  day. And even tell me what time it''s going to be.'
- 'Them: I think last year because I always host Christmas Eve and everyone comes
  around at 6. And I definitely wasn''t working by then.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: But I think from five I''m going to start doing the work.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Just because if I wait until six, everybody else will press their buttons
  and then I''ll be sat here till seven. On my own. I think we just put a live five,
  if not earlier, but I''ll confirm.'
- 'Me: You''re not doing that, are you? You''re not going into.'
- 'Them: No, not in now till. Six.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: That''s fine.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Oh, I have got some. If we''re all good on the 24th. Then. I did get some
  updates from. Fearless leaders at Oakley, which is fun. So I started doing budget,
  demand and spend for P. 10, 11 and 12.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: And then Sepp turned around to me and said, you need to cut out all your
  additional spending.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: And this doesn''t apply to Google, because I''m just not. I''ve just ignored
  him. And you need to fire me. Some savings. I was like,'
- 'Me: Just.'
- 'Them: So I basically just said to poor old Pay who works on Meta that you need
  to give me some money.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So we do have new. Google numbers. The budget.'
- 'Me: Is that on that same. Same spreadsheet?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Rows 22 and 23. Although I''m thinking. On 1747.'
- 'Me: Please.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Of course. I''ll put it in this chat in Archer.'
- 'Me: Not let me access that.'
- 'Them: Let me. Do another. One. I should send you an email in a sec.'
- 'Me: You have to sell yourself with this, don''t you?'
- 'Them: Yep.'
- 'Me: Understandably. Come. On. There we go. So this isn''t up to date, then?'
- 'Them: They are now. So I''ve just stripped everything back.'
- 'Me: So178. That''s your whole lot. That''s sorry. Now it''s a whole lot.'
- 'Them: Yes, if you look.'
- 'Me: Gotcha172. 117. Down it goes.'
- 'Them: Well.'
- 'Me: 1 1.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Gets more miserable the more you go down in it. There you go. In the
  green.'
- 'Me: So 117419. I don''t. Possible question is that likely to change?'
- 'Them: Definitely not after. Tomorrow.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Well, I mean, I''ve saved him. 75 grand. So, I mean, he can kind of. Leave
  it alone. Now.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, hopefully they''ll be happy with the Google Ad stuff over.'
- 'Them: This is it. But they''re just like. I nearly said. Something could be on
  PC, but.'
- 'Me: Go for it.'
- 'Them: Just going to say they''re just autistic, aren''t they? It''s just like,
  what? This to this, to this, to this. And they''ll see a good performance and they''ll
  go, Can you. Can you do a bit more of that?'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: And you go. But you''ve literally just asked me to give you all the money
  back.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but we''ve had a good couple of weeks. So can we keep. Talking to children
  sometimes.'
- 'Me: I genuinely did not think we''d be anywhere near the revenue target. We''re
  not there yet, but I really didn''t think it was going to be anywhere near what
  they wanted. But unfortunately, as you say, if you do it so then if you do do it,
  so what can you do? Can you do some more of that then? Well, no, I''ve had sleepless
  nights as it is getting to this stage.'
- 'Them: Yeah. You''ve just made me spend two days, figure out how I''m going to.
  Give you a lot of money back without bleeding sales.'
- 'Me: Y. Es. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So I bet you that happens. But I''m going to give it. Give the numbers to
  Seb tomorrow. And just say, there you go. Well, there''s your saving. So you''ve
  had best of both worlds now because we''ve done better than you thought and got
  some money saved, but don''t come back to me.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: In February when you plan basically.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Because that''s going to be a big drop as well. Isn''t that 47 in February?'
- 'Them: But almost February and March are a bit like maintenance modes because they''re
  so just. The business isn''t hugely seasonal, but February, March are just shit.
  You can''t really. Summer it starts to pick up again.'
- 'Me: I say it''s better off spending the money when you can, when you, you know
  it''s going to come back. But the weird thing is we''ve just sudden got all this
  data on Europe and rest of the world. To play around with where they been doing
  well.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then all of a sudden, we''re going to stop it. That''s going to be a hard
  one. I think one thing I''d like to do. Or could you. Could you have a word with
  Beth again about that? I know she''d be busy if she can do the salesforce stuff.
  The API stuff before. Before we finish for Christmas. It''d be great because then
  I''ll have a play with it over Christmas then.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: I just want to. I want to do some analysis on. We. We already use the hero
  psychics, villains and zombies for the UK and the US. We don''t do for Europe and
  the rest of the world because there''s not enough traffic there.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And they''re, you know, there''s not enough traffic for individual countries,
  but I''d like to do some analysis on individual products that sell in Google Ads.
  For those countries and do some filtering on those. So we may not be advertising
  the whole of the the catalog for those countries. Difficult because, you know, diaries
  do have the spike, don''t they? You know, they get spike, November, December, January,
  in fact.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: There''s many. Middle of December, it started kicking up, so we can''t put
  too much weight on it, but at least get an idea on what products are selling. So
  that we''re spending the money intelligently in those countries rather than just
  chucking the whole catalog at them. But that''s the project for New Year anyway,
  so if she can do that, then.'
- 'Them: I''m speaking to her at two.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: So I''ll bring it up. I''ll bring it out there.'
- 'Me: I think I''ve given her everything she needs. But if she does need anything
  else, just. Just get.'
- 'Them: Well, I''ll just see where she is with it.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Them: All right, fair enough. Yeah, I''ll see where she''s at with it. Yeah. Really
  on. This is a Google Analytics view of the world, so it''s not. Quite. Completely
  scratching. Google Ads back. But non brand revenue. Was almost three. Plus 125%
  versus last year.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: In the UK for 28% extra spend. In the US we managed 70% more non brand revenue.
  Or 22% less spend.'
- 'Me: Wow. W. Ow.'
- 'Them: They''re not going to go into the account and just have a little dig around
  and go, okay, because obviously you''re not going to see, like, I don''t mind it
  so much, but obviously, where analytics tells you a story, Meta tells you a story.
  AdWise tells you a story. But you just got to find, like, the tangential links.
  Never obviously find. It''s a bit like the search term stuff.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yeah.'
- 'Them: I tell that I pull out certain search terms. That I think are interesting
  rather than I can''t give them. This is 100% like you said to me the other week.
  You''re not going to get 100% of your traffic within the search term report.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But you can get a flavor of what''s good.'
- 'Me: Yes, you can. Yes, you can. And it tends to be the more successful the search
  term is, the more chance it''s going to be to show you still get.'
- 'Them: News submission. Random shit in there as well.'
- 'Me: The brown was.'
- 'Them: You get some really random that it picks up.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think your analytics is from your perspective, analytics
  is probably the best. Thing to go for. Can you see new customers in analytics?'
- 'Them: You can. Yeah. But we''ve got, like, a single customer view. Database that
  sits outside of that, that is our sort of. North Star, if you like. Because as I
  say, as you all know, with any of these, there''s all these bloody caveats, isn''t
  there?'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: You can believe almost all of this and then almost.'
- 'Me: Oh, unless you spend a huge amount of money on attribution modeling. You just
  gotta. You got to go for gut feel. Sometimes it sounds horrible. Multimillion.'
- 'Them: True, though. But like rest of the wild traffic. Was 90,000 visits. And that
  was the. Obviously, it''s not true. That was the ship from Japan and South America
  last week. Saw those bits. You go right on a bit of paper somewhere and remember
  it for next year.'
- 'Me: Yes, you do, because it screws up your conversion rate.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So I''m trying to get Mike, who produces a dashboards. To one way or
  another. Take that shit out.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Or even if he just gives me an average of the last two weeks and uses that
  for this week, that''s going to be a hell of a lot. So he reckons we have 90,000
  visits versus 12,000 the week before.'
- 'Me: All from brazil. And they didn''t buy a.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Not too sure. One of the girls in. The more sort of trade side said
  to me, we''ll just use that number until we get a new one. Please don''t use that
  number. Pete, don''t do that.'
- 'Me: It''ll be.'
- 'Them: That would be. Yeah, because you''re not going to be able to explain it,
  so don''t do it.'
- 'Me: No, no. Yes. It''s a different matter when you stand up in front of people
  and actually explain what''s going on as a result of that, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And they don''t have any of the context that you''ve
  got around kind of what possibly what the isms are. Doing this. But yeah. Just wait.
  I''ll give you a number you can use, which I''m happy for you to use them, but do
  not say we actually got 90,000 visits because. We only managed for the whole site.
  We only manage about 140,000 for all of them. Uk, us, Europe. So come on, there''s
  no way rest of oil is not 90.'
- 'Me: I think. I think that''s the thing that comes with experience, isn''t it? When
  you''re doing a sanity check, it takes your downsight. Quicker doing it, the more
  experience you''ve had.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah.'
- 'Me: You figure, oh, isn''t this amazing? You look at it going. No, it''s not actually.
  It can''t possibly be very high. It''s one thing I''m finding with AI Is. Is that
  you need to. You need to sanity check it a hell of a lot. You know it will just
  say, no, this is definitely right, and you go, really? And you almost say that.
  Really? Oh, no, you''re quite right. Yes. I''ve forgotten about this, this, this
  and this.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah, well, I''m definitely using it a lot more now as well.'
- 'Me: I''m. I''m loving it now. It''s. It''s playing. It plays funny beggars every
  now and again, but the system is finally coming together. And certainly for doing.
  I''m looking forward to next year, the sort of depth of analysis I''m going to be
  able to do. At product level. Will be just phenomenal. You know? I think one of
  the problems, especially when working with a customer for a long time, you have
  assumptions, and it looks at it from a very cold perspective. It only looks at the
  numbers. It has no emotion whatsoever.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it heard from that perspect. If I say to it about. You know, about roas.
  I want the campaigns with the highest roas. Then for budget increases, it will absolutely
  do that. You have to apply the nuance to it to say, well, actually, I think Dari''s
  gonna do quite well. Now go back and look at it seasonally and apply the budgets
  that way. So you''ve got to give it a real direction.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: The longer it goes, the bigger the knowledge base on the sites becomes. And
  that''s the value. That''s the real value. You know, if you imagine if you were
  to do that over 10 years, It would be absolutely nailed on. Apart from little lips
  on it. It would. It would completely understand it.'
- 'Them: Be nice. Actually, I''m looking forward to annualizing some of this. Rest
  of the world performance because at the minute. It''s just 6,000%. 10,000% plus
  7.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it''s not great. The ROAS compared with the others isn''t
  as good, but it''s still 539% and it''s still incremental business. So it has value
  to the business, but not necessarily as a roas. So got to be careful in a situation
  like this where we''re going for the campaigns with the highest roas us not to exclude
  rest of the world completely. It''s almost like saying that we, we need a minimum
  percentage spend of the budget going to each of those four regions. And then based
  on that, go and go and allocate the budgets.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But it''s what basis you do that on. You know, and that''s, that''s far too
  deep a question because that''s then going to the marketing department, say, how
  much do you want to spend, percentage wise, on the rest of the world? And they go,
  we haven''t got a bloody clue. Absolutely no idea.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Well, we''ll have more of an proper budget for rest of the world, so
  we didn''t have one for this year. It was just. Let''s try and do something.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So at least we''ve set a baseline so spent X generated wide in for next year.
  We know. What''s realistic.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ll do. I''ll do it. I mean, there''s all sorts of reports to come,
  but I''ll do a breakdown in the new year of actual locations. So it''s a big bucket
  for rest of the world is Australia is a separate campaign. The rest is just one
  big bucket. So I should be able to split that out into the individual countries.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And come up with an idea of which ones are doing well and which ones aren''t.
  So if you think. If you think it''s been launched as a scatter gun. It''s actually
  not done too bad, has it? It''s not been restricted any sort of way to specific
  areas. I don''t. I think we don''t do like Nigeria and the Philippines and things
  like, you know, the way they''re known scam places, but the rest of it is pretty
  broad. And yet it still managed to do that High roas. So the long term, it''s looking
  quite good for that, that we will be able to narrow it down and really, really batter
  those individual areas.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And you do see the same locations. So if we ever wanted to kind of
  sort of keep expanding it, You know, it''s always your Australia''s and your Singapores,
  Hong Kong, uae.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Those tend to be the ones that we see conversions for, like, every week in,
  in ads.'
- 'Me: Yeah. That''d be.'
- 'Them: Particularly Australia.'
- 'Me: Great. Sorry. Say again?'
- 'Them: Particularly Australia. That''s the third.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Biggest international market after the US.'
- 'Me: Is it really? Wow.'
- 'Them: We don''t do any marketing specifically to that audience either.'
- 'Me: That''s potentially X parts. Then.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, and it''ll be the language as well, so. And then, like the UAE
  thing, Singapore is a bit of expats, isn''t it? And a bit of like, you know, it''s
  very Western. The UAE is kind of from that side of the world. Have always kind of
  love that.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: British kind of heritage stuff.'
- 'Me: I have a client who does interior design courses, so it''s a lead gen type
  business. And that''s their second biggest market is the uae. So much so that one
  of the guys has moved over there. He''s living there, setting the studio.'
- 'Them: Hi.'
- 'Me: Up, you know, it''s huge. Of course, they got. They''ve got shed loads of money
  as well. That''s been very realistic. But, you know, they''re not short with Bobber,
  too. Though.'
- 'Them: No, no. Quite. Yeah. Not shy spending, either.'
- 'Me: No. No. I think I''m going to. Drop this spreadsheet down now while I can.
  See if that. If that, I''m. I''m sure you''ll tell me. Anyway, if any of those budgets
  change, you can piss out.'
- 'Them: Yeah, we''ll do so as it is now. Is what I''ll show to Seb and then. Yeah.
  I can''t see. That you can change much more. Without really kind of just going.
  Just do the kind of minimum everywhere.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Then.'
- 'Me: So. There''s no demands in there yet. Then. Will there be separate demands
  for the individual channels?'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''ve got them on a separate tab. So I''ve got the total demand. There''s
  a paid search tab. Fourth one in from the left.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I''ve got some total demand in.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: There. Yeah. Below it is demand by market, Obviously. Rest of the world hasn''t
  got one because it hasn''t got a budget, but. Those are the total demands for the
  months.'
- 'Me: For Google Ads.'
- 'Them: Yeah, just Google Ads.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay? I''ll use that for the strategy from the 29th. I try and get it
  changed as quickly as possible around that time so we don''t overrun at all because
  we''d be on big spend on the 20 eigth.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: We were going to go away between Christmas and New Year, and we''re not now.
  We''re just going to have days out and stuff, so I''m going to be around in that,
  in that time.'
- 'Them: I mean, I''ll be on, so if there''s any. Anything. You need me to do? Just
  drop me a. Drop me a line. Yeah, I''ll be around the whole time.'
- 'Me: And then we''ll be back in full flow by the fifth anyway, won''t we? Before.
  The european. Yeah, okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Awesome.'
- 'Me: Okay, dockey.'
- 'Them: Cool. I''ll let you know. If there''s any changes after talking to Seab tomorrow.
  But otherwise, those. Yeah, as we are. Those are the numbers in there.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: And then I''ll give you a shout once all text adds are done. And I''ll give
  you drop your message as well when all the assets are in the library.'
- 'Me: Fantastic. I need. I mean, I''ll be around on. On Christmas Eve. It should
  be a fairly simple job. Because I''m going to do all the prep first for putting
  the text assets up from those spreadsheets. So if you want me to do any of the sales
  stuff, Just. Just let me know. Pick a country, and I''ll just whack them in there.
  Are you just going to do? Is it just three creatives? Just with the three different
  ratios.'
- 'Them: I wish. No, they''ve got, like. The way they''ve done it is they''ve given
  me, like, five. Five of each. Ratio. And I''m just going to put them all into every
  category. Into every.'
- 'Me: Right, so you''ve only got 20.'
- 'Them: Something like that. Yeah. So what I wanted was just a graphic, really. That
  I could just put in, but that''s not what they want to do. So I''ve got.'
- 'Me: So you''re going to replace all the stuff that''s in there already?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Oh, wow. I''m busy that day. Mate.'
- 'Them: It won''t take too much longer to replace it.'
- 'Me: But at least it can just all be zapped. Because once you pop, once you go into
  it, It shows you at the bottom what they are, and you''re just basically clicking
  them out, aren''t you?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Then just dropping in the ones from the library that I''ve got.'
- 'Me: Don''t. Don''t forget. Sorry. Don''t forget on your library. I think you did
  this last time. Create yourself a fold. And that makes it. It makes it really easy,
  then.'
- 'Them: Yes. I''ve got Winter south phase one. So that''s in the UK one already.
  And it looks like I''ve got six assets for each. One, two, three. Okay, I''ve got
  six. Square six.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Portrait. And then five. One, two, three. No, six of each. Okay, fine. So
  I''m just going to. Probably put. Because the way they''ve done this is they''ve
  not been like, oh, here''s your ones for this one, here''s your ones for that one.
  They just got his. His six images.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: So I''m going to put them across and the wording just says up to 50 off.
  So I''m just going to put them all in, everything.'
- 'Me: Good. Yeah.'
- 'Them: None of this, like trying to be like the bad one. Only goes in bags like
  it''s a bloody sale. We''ll just put it. In. Unless you prefer.'
- 'Me: No, I''m just thinking. I''m just thinking whether you can select all of. The
  campaigns.'
- 'Them: Dump these assets into all of these.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So assets. Can I zip this to p max? Let''s screw it up. Once you just
  Once you''ve done them, just give us a shout. I''ll sense check it for you. Once
  it''s done.'
- 'Them: Yes. Oh, I know. I''ll have a Guinness or a glass of wine, and I''ll just
  go through.'
- 'Me: That''s what I''m worried. About?'
- 'Them: Yeah. They''ll be done quick enough.'
- 'Me: Cool. All right. Then.'
- 'Them: Good. Oh, and I''ll also. I''m just. Going to make a copy of the markdown
  sheet, and I''ll just have you just want product name and product skew.'
- 'Me: Just scoop.'
- 'Them: I''ll just send you the list of the SKUs.'
- 'Me: Okay. Uk us.'
- 'Them: Let me see what they''ve done. Right. All currents. It looks like it''s all
  the same. There''s no original or market differences.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: So I''m just going to send you the skewer. This. This entire sku list.'
- 'Me: And these are what? These are all the same amount? Of.'
- 'Them: No. Do you want that?'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: So I''ve got markdown discount percentage column as well.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay. Well, I''ll consult it then, can''t I?'
- 'Them: Yeah. So let me. Yeah, so it is. Some of this is old markdown where it was
  reduced up to 60, but once you''re not. Communicating that at a minute.'
- 'Me: Because each. Each markdown percentage is going to need a different promotion.'
- 'Them: So can you. Clock. So some of them are, like, 50%, obviously. Some of them
  were 40%. Some of them are 33%.'
- 'Me: Let me have a look.'
- 'Them: Because obviously where it''s up, up to.'
- 'Me: I''m not too sure what I can do an up. To. You can do it on a you can do it
  on a promotion extension, but in the. Yeah, it''s a specific percentage off.'
- 'Them: Well. If we do, we overlay like. The performance to date of these products.
  So, like, if the heroes and sidekicks. Would that only surface the good ones within
  it or. So I''m just trying to think how.'
- 'Me: The easiest way is just to sort it and just create individual promotions for
  it.'
- 'Them: It gets simpler. Yeah, I don''t think there''s that many different ones.'
- 'Me: That''s fine. Well, we''re far enough out. It''s not as though it''s. It''s
  Wednesday. You know, I''ve got time to do it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Let me just save this down and I get this.'
- 'Me: No, I can. Yes, I can. So it''s up to 60% then, is it?'
- 'Them: Technically, but the messaging is up to 50. It will go into up to 60, but
  the messaging is. Is up to 50.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay?'
- 'Them: Because there is stuff that 60 off. But that was the stuff that, like in
  the Somerset, I always put 60 and we can''t put it back down.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: So we have to keep it at that. Higher price, but it''s not the messaging
  that we go with.'
- 'Me: It''s fine. I can do. I can do up to 50 off.'
- 'Them: Nice, okay?'
- 'Me: And then now going on Christmas Day and change it again because it will reject
  it, and then.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Well, you should have that.'
- 'Me: Come. On. Right. So those are. Those are true, right across the board, aren''t
  they? So us and uk, nice. Create. Copy of. That. Thank you.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I''ll give you. There should be any other changes to that. Now, that
  should just be pretty much. Done.'
- 'Me: Nice. And it''s less than a thousand. So if it''s more than 1000 SKUs, I have
  to split them over a number of different promotions. So that''s good. It''s 700.
  Odd.'
- 'Them: Okay, good. Makes life easy.'
- 'Me: Now. Okay? I think we have a plan.'
- 'Them: Good stuff, Right? Okay, so I''m going to use my next 10 minutes makeup.'
- 'Me: Use wise. Ly.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And I''ll just update you on the other two bits. In.'
- 'Me: Fantastic.'
- 'Them: As and when they''re done.'
- 'Me: All right.'
- 'Them: Good. I appreciate that. Thank you.'
- 'Me: Speak to you later in the week.'
- 'Them: It''s a bit.'
- 'Me: Bye now.'
- 'Them: Bye.'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Me: Yes. Why are we still having this problem with the product feeds location? My understanding is that the Christmas Eve sale was UK only. Double check this. Normally for Christmas delivery. All right. Mate. There we go.
- Them: I'm not going to say it. There we go.
- Me: Hello. It's just ready for the. Ready for Christmas. Mate. I'm just wasted. Absolutely wasted.
- Them: It's only one I can look.
- Me: I know. It's been a bit of a roller coaster, this, isn't it?
- Them: Yep. What is this?
- Me: We're getting there, though, mate. It's looking promising.
- Them: Yeah. Good on new customers again.
- Me: Is it? Oh, that's good.
- Them: It's got to be the non brand stuff. Because the key difference year on year is the mix between brand and non brand sperm, particularly in the uk.
- Me: Right. Right, okay.
- Them: So new customers. From non brand paid search was up 64% versus last year.
- Me: Lovely. Wow.
- Them: Not bad.
- Me: Yeah, well, the icing on the cake will be to hit the revenue target. Then.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Fingers crossed on that one.
- Them: Quite. And it's going to be. Hard. Tricky now until christmas eve.
- Me: Yeah, this morning. I've reduced the budgets. I'm keeping my powder dry.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So the whole thing is spending two grand a day at the moment. And then the strategy is. Let me just get.
- Them: What is in all accounts. Or account.
- Me: So. Two grand today, three grand tomorrow. So as soon as. Sorry. Two grand today, two grand tomorrow. Three grand on. Christmas eve. I'll probably leave it at three grand for Christmas Day. And then we're up to 10 on Boxing Day. And then we're just going to basically piss the budget away. From that point onwards, whatever's left.
- Them: S.
- Me: Will be allocated. I've done two changes today.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I'd already scheduled some changes to take it down to 2k, but I've done a bit of jiggling around because the diaries have started kicking quite dramatically. So I've just shifted money within accounts towards the diaries because they're starting to get a decent roas. But there are assets for P9. They're fantastic. 6, 39 for the UK, 9, 48 for the US, 8, 78 for Europe and 5, 54 for the rest of the world. So that's a blended roas of 7:56 for p9. Which is. Yeah, I never would have thought it.
- Them: With no double conversion counting either.
- Me: That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. Yes, it does make a difference, doesn't it? When this kicks in. Some of those. Will go up to. Let's just see. So boxing day last year. Was 1, 200 for the uk, 1600 to the us. 2,900 for Europe and Bristol wasn't in the game. So if we can get just anywhere near that, then we've hit the target.
- Them: Yeah, it was a good week overall as well.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Certainly from online. I don't know about stores.
- Me: Well. It was taking stuff down at the beginning of the week was the worry, because the UK didn't seem to be doing very well. But there seems to be a lot of last minute traffic. I pulled it down today. We talked about it didn't with it, probably from today it will drop. And looking at the conversion rates from last year, that bears the whole thing out. So rather than throw money at stuff that's not going to convert as well, might as well just pull our horns in and wait for the big bang.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: As far as. The assets are concerned. So you're going to have the. Do you think by the end of today, the text assets will be done?
- Them: Yeah. Today. Text assets be done and. The creatives will be uploaded to all of the accounts.
- Me: Okay? So then they'll just need allocating to the individual campaigns.
- Them: Yeah. Which I presume that I'll just do on christmas eve. Because obviously, I presume, once you hit save, they'll start serving.
- Me: As soon as you're. What you can do is you can load them up into the Asset Studio asset library, the main one for each account. So then when you go into the individual campaigns and select them, that's when they start showing, so you can actually upload the creative.
- Them: Yeah, I'll do that today.
- Me: First. Great. Okay?
- Them: Yeah, I'll put it into the folders to that end of the library.
- Me: Brilliant.
- Them: And then what I'll do is I will start putting them in about an hour, putting them live about an hour before I think we're going to go.
- Me: Okay? Okay?
- Them: Because it's going to take. Bit of time anyway.
- Me: They won't serve instantly.
- Them: No. And even if they do, it's going to be the odd person that will see it and it doesn't matter.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And it's not going to be the key thing. It's not going to be someone who's shopping in the store. The chances someone in the UK seeing the PMAX asset while they're shopping in the store.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: Yeah, so just try and get myself some favors.
- Me: Just say this Hallucinating or something? And what they're going to do about it. Start the rebound. Is it?
- Them: Well, no, it's just part of life, so.
- Me: They're in the store because they've gotten to buy their wife's present and they need something there and then, don't they?
- Them: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Otherwise, why are you shopping solo and Christmas Eve?
- Me: Y. Es.
- Them: Lose it. Yes, that's fine. So all text assets should be done today. Everything uploaded into the libraries today. That's another thing. I have got a markdown list for you if you want to do. A promo. Not code base, though.
- Me: Yeah. Great. Okay?
- Them: If it matters. Mark. Down.
- Me: Get that loaded today and get it ready.
- Them: Yeah. Cool. What I'll do is I've got an Excel sheet I'll put it into. Last time, isn't it? You said attachment. Enough.
- Me: The Excel spreadsheet's fine. I can work for them. I just save it as a copy. Because it's your SharePoint Excel, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Cool. All right. Now I just won't do it on the web version, so I think that was didn't work. Fine. So I'd get that sent over.
- Me: Could you also send me the sale URL?
- Them: Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Now.
- Me: Because I'm going to create a promotion extension for it. Which is a winter sale. 50% off selected lines. So 50% up to 50% off selected styles. Sorry. Styles it is.
- Them: Up to. Yeah, I'm just going to send you all the. Europe we don't need at the minute.
- Me: Still started catching up. Yet.
- Them: I don't think so.
- Me: It's not a last minute job, then it's not shifted. When the peak is right, it's just not coming. Right.
- Them: It's just more miserable. For them, I think.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So I think this is. Okay? So that's fine. That's fine. Yeah. So I guess with Europe, we just don't do anything really until the 6th. As we just kind of.
- Me: Well, that's what I wanted to confirm. You.
- Them: Sits.
- Me: At 6:00 on the 24th. We've got everything. But we got uk, US and rest of world going into sale. Right, okay. For some reason, I've not got that written down. Anyway, it doesn't make any difference. That's fine. So the assets are going to change for those three regions.
- Them: Yeah, and I believe. The European websites are just going to stay in their current Christmassy themes anyway.
- Me: Okay? But they'll use that sale. That sale URL be live.
- Them: Europe. They'll just get a holding page if anyone in Europe tries to search for sale. So basically we just won't touch the Europe account, apart from probably to just. If we can obviously reallocate. Steadily reallocate budget, then great.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Otherwise.
- Me: That's exactly what I'm doing. There's all sorts of shuffling around going on.
- Them: Yeah. Otherwise we don't need to touch Europe between now and the sixth, to be honest. I put all the tech assets in there anyway.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Just so it's ready, but, yeah, there's nothing to be done.
- Me: So US, UK, row live, 4 o'clock on the 24th. So that's obviously regardless of time zone, really, isn't it?
- Them: On bgmt. It'll just be when Seb gives us the nod, which is normally between 4 and 6.
- Me: Right.
- Them: But as I say,
- Me: It's like the teacher saying, when you can go home. The guy opposite me is an assistant head, and it's his job to say what time the kids can go on the last day. And even tell me what time it's going to be.
- Them: I think last year because I always host Christmas Eve and everyone comes around at 6. And I definitely wasn't working by then.
- Me: Right.
- Them: But I think from five I'm going to start doing the work.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Just because if I wait until six, everybody else will press their buttons and then I'll be sat here till seven. On my own. I think we just put a live five, if not earlier, but I'll confirm.
- Me: You're not doing that, are you? You're not going into.
- Them: No, not in now till. Six.
- Me: Right.
- Them: That's fine.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Oh, I have got some. If we're all good on the 24th. Then. I did get some updates from. Fearless leaders at Oakley, which is fun. So I started doing budget, demand and spend for P. 10, 11 and 12.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: And then Sepp turned around to me and said, you need to cut out all your additional spending.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: And this doesn't apply to Google, because I'm just not. I've just ignored him. And you need to fire me. Some savings. I was like,
- Me: Just.
- Them: So I basically just said to poor old Pay who works on Meta that you need to give me some money.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So we do have new. Google numbers. The budget.
- Me: Is that on that same. Same spreadsheet?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Rows 22 and 23. Although I'm thinking. On 1747.
- Me: Please.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Of course. I'll put it in this chat in Archer.
- Me: Not let me access that.
- Them: Let me. Do another. One. I should send you an email in a sec.
- Me: You have to sell yourself with this, don't you?
- Them: Yep.
- Me: Understandably. Come. On. There we go. So this isn't up to date, then?
- Them: They are now. So I've just stripped everything back.
- Me: So178. That's your whole lot. That's sorry. Now it's a whole lot.
- Them: Yes, if you look.
- Me: Gotcha172. 117. Down it goes.
- Them: Well.
- Me: 1 1.
- Them: Yeah. Gets more miserable the more you go down in it. There you go. In the green.
- Me: So 117419. I don't. Possible question is that likely to change?
- Them: Definitely not after. Tomorrow.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Well, I mean, I've saved him. 75 grand. So, I mean, he can kind of. Leave it alone. Now.
- Me: Yeah. Well, hopefully they'll be happy with the Google Ad stuff over.
- Them: This is it. But they're just like. I nearly said. Something could be on PC, but.
- Me: Go for it.
- Them: Just going to say they're just autistic, aren't they? It's just like, what? This to this, to this, to this. And they'll see a good performance and they'll go, Can you. Can you do a bit more of that?
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: And you go. But you've literally just asked me to give you all the money back.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: Yeah, but we've had a good couple of weeks. So can we keep. Talking to children sometimes.
- Me: I genuinely did not think we'd be anywhere near the revenue target. We're not there yet, but I really didn't think it was going to be anywhere near what they wanted. But unfortunately, as you say, if you do it so then if you do do it, so what can you do? Can you do some more of that then? Well, no, I've had sleepless nights as it is getting to this stage.
- Them: Yeah. You've just made me spend two days, figure out how I'm going to. Give you a lot of money back without bleeding sales.
- Me: Y. Es. Yeah.
- Them: So I bet you that happens. But I'm going to give it. Give the numbers to Seb tomorrow. And just say, there you go. Well, there's your saving. So you've had best of both worlds now because we've done better than you thought and got some money saved, but don't come back to me.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: In February when you plan basically.
- Me: Yeah. Because that's going to be a big drop as well. Isn't that 47 in February?
- Them: But almost February and March are a bit like maintenance modes because they're so just. The business isn't hugely seasonal, but February, March are just shit. You can't really. Summer it starts to pick up again.
- Me: I say it's better off spending the money when you can, when you, you know it's going to come back. But the weird thing is we've just sudden got all this data on Europe and rest of the world. To play around with where they been doing well.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And then all of a sudden, we're going to stop it. That's going to be a hard one. I think one thing I'd like to do. Or could you. Could you have a word with Beth again about that? I know she'd be busy if she can do the salesforce stuff. The API stuff before. Before we finish for Christmas. It'd be great because then I'll have a play with it over Christmas then.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: I just want to. I want to do some analysis on. We. We already use the hero psychics, villains and zombies for the UK and the US. We don't do for Europe and the rest of the world because there's not enough traffic there.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And they're, you know, there's not enough traffic for individual countries, but I'd like to do some analysis on individual products that sell in Google Ads. For those countries and do some filtering on those. So we may not be advertising the whole of the the catalog for those countries. Difficult because, you know, diaries do have the spike, don't they? You know, they get spike, November, December, January, in fact.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: There's many. Middle of December, it started kicking up, so we can't put too much weight on it, but at least get an idea on what products are selling. So that we're spending the money intelligently in those countries rather than just chucking the whole catalog at them. But that's the project for New Year anyway, so if she can do that, then.
- Them: I'm speaking to her at two.
- Me: Great.
- Them: So I'll bring it up. I'll bring it out there.
- Me: I think I've given her everything she needs. But if she does need anything else, just. Just get.
- Them: Well, I'll just see where she is with it.
- Me: Yeah. Okay?
- Them: All right, fair enough. Yeah, I'll see where she's at with it. Yeah. Really on. This is a Google Analytics view of the world, so it's not. Quite. Completely scratching. Google Ads back. But non brand revenue. Was almost three. Plus 125% versus last year.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: In the UK for 28% extra spend. In the US we managed 70% more non brand revenue. Or 22% less spend.
- Me: Wow. W. Ow.
- Them: They're not going to go into the account and just have a little dig around and go, okay, because obviously you're not going to see, like, I don't mind it so much, but obviously, where analytics tells you a story, Meta tells you a story. AdWise tells you a story. But you just got to find, like, the tangential links. Never obviously find. It's a bit like the search term stuff.
- Me: Yes. Yeah.
- Them: I tell that I pull out certain search terms. That I think are interesting rather than I can't give them. This is 100% like you said to me the other week. You're not going to get 100% of your traffic within the search term report.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But you can get a flavor of what's good.
- Me: Yes, you can. Yes, you can. And it tends to be the more successful the search term is, the more chance it's going to be to show you still get.
- Them: News submission. Random shit in there as well.
- Me: The brown was.
- Them: You get some really random that it picks up.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think your analytics is from your perspective, analytics is probably the best. Thing to go for. Can you see new customers in analytics?
- Them: You can. Yeah. But we've got, like, a single customer view. Database that sits outside of that, that is our sort of. North Star, if you like. Because as I say, as you all know, with any of these, there's all these bloody caveats, isn't there?
- Me: Right.
- Them: You can believe almost all of this and then almost.
- Me: Oh, unless you spend a huge amount of money on attribution modeling. You just gotta. You got to go for gut feel. Sometimes it sounds horrible. Multimillion.
- Them: True, though. But like rest of the wild traffic. Was 90,000 visits. And that was the. Obviously, it's not true. That was the ship from Japan and South America last week. Saw those bits. You go right on a bit of paper somewhere and remember it for next year.
- Me: Yes, you do, because it screws up your conversion rate.
- Them: Yeah. So I'm trying to get Mike, who produces a dashboards. To one way or another. Take that shit out.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Or even if he just gives me an average of the last two weeks and uses that for this week, that's going to be a hell of a lot. So he reckons we have 90,000 visits versus 12,000 the week before.
- Me: All from brazil. And they didn't buy a.
- Them: Yeah. Not too sure. One of the girls in. The more sort of trade side said to me, we'll just use that number until we get a new one. Please don't use that number. Pete, don't do that.
- Me: It'll be.
- Them: That would be. Yeah, because you're not going to be able to explain it, so don't do it.
- Me: No, no. Yes. It's a different matter when you stand up in front of people and actually explain what's going on as a result of that, isn't it?
- Them: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And they don't have any of the context that you've got around kind of what possibly what the isms are. Doing this. But yeah. Just wait. I'll give you a number you can use, which I'm happy for you to use them, but do not say we actually got 90,000 visits because. We only managed for the whole site. We only manage about 140,000 for all of them. Uk, us, Europe. So come on, there's no way rest of oil is not 90.
- Me: I think. I think that's the thing that comes with experience, isn't it? When you're doing a sanity check, it takes your downsight. Quicker doing it, the more experience you've had.
- Them: Oh, yeah.
- Me: You figure, oh, isn't this amazing? You look at it going. No, it's not actually. It can't possibly be very high. It's one thing I'm finding with AI Is. Is that you need to. You need to sanity check it a hell of a lot. You know it will just say, no, this is definitely right, and you go, really? And you almost say that. Really? Oh, no, you're quite right. Yes. I've forgotten about this, this, this and this.
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah, well, I'm definitely using it a lot more now as well.
- Me: I'm. I'm loving it now. It's. It's playing. It plays funny beggars every now and again, but the system is finally coming together. And certainly for doing. I'm looking forward to next year, the sort of depth of analysis I'm going to be able to do. At product level. Will be just phenomenal. You know? I think one of the problems, especially when working with a customer for a long time, you have assumptions, and it looks at it from a very cold perspective. It only looks at the numbers. It has no emotion whatsoever.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it heard from that perspect. If I say to it about. You know, about roas. I want the campaigns with the highest roas. Then for budget increases, it will absolutely do that. You have to apply the nuance to it to say, well, actually, I think Dari's gonna do quite well. Now go back and look at it seasonally and apply the budgets that way. So you've got to give it a real direction.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: The longer it goes, the bigger the knowledge base on the sites becomes. And that's the value. That's the real value. You know, if you imagine if you were to do that over 10 years, It would be absolutely nailed on. Apart from little lips on it. It would. It would completely understand it.
- Them: Be nice. Actually, I'm looking forward to annualizing some of this. Rest of the world performance because at the minute. It's just 6,000%. 10,000% plus 7.
- Me: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's not great. The ROAS compared with the others isn't as good, but it's still 539% and it's still incremental business. So it has value to the business, but not necessarily as a roas. So got to be careful in a situation like this where we're going for the campaigns with the highest roas us not to exclude rest of the world completely. It's almost like saying that we, we need a minimum percentage spend of the budget going to each of those four regions. And then based on that, go and go and allocate the budgets.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But it's what basis you do that on. You know, and that's, that's far too deep a question because that's then going to the marketing department, say, how much do you want to spend, percentage wise, on the rest of the world? And they go, we haven't got a bloody clue. Absolutely no idea.
- Them: Yeah. Well, we'll have more of an proper budget for rest of the world, so we didn't have one for this year. It was just. Let's try and do something.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So at least we've set a baseline so spent X generated wide in for next year. We know. What's realistic.
- Me: Well, I'll do. I'll do it. I mean, there's all sorts of reports to come, but I'll do a breakdown in the new year of actual locations. So it's a big bucket for rest of the world is Australia is a separate campaign. The rest is just one big bucket. So I should be able to split that out into the individual countries.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And come up with an idea of which ones are doing well and which ones aren't. So if you think. If you think it's been launched as a scatter gun. It's actually not done too bad, has it? It's not been restricted any sort of way to specific areas. I don't. I think we don't do like Nigeria and the Philippines and things like, you know, the way they're known scam places, but the rest of it is pretty broad. And yet it still managed to do that High roas. So the long term, it's looking quite good for that, that we will be able to narrow it down and really, really batter those individual areas.
- Them: Yeah. And you do see the same locations. So if we ever wanted to kind of sort of keep expanding it, You know, it's always your Australia's and your Singapores, Hong Kong, uae.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Those tend to be the ones that we see conversions for, like, every week in, in ads.
- Me: Yeah. That'd be.
- Them: Particularly Australia.
- Me: Great. Sorry. Say again?
- Them: Particularly Australia. That's the third.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Biggest international market after the US.
- Me: Is it really? Wow.
- Them: We don't do any marketing specifically to that audience either.
- Me: That's potentially X parts. Then.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, and it'll be the language as well, so. And then, like the UAE thing, Singapore is a bit of expats, isn't it? And a bit of like, you know, it's very Western. The UAE is kind of from that side of the world. Have always kind of love that.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: British kind of heritage stuff.
- Me: I have a client who does interior design courses, so it's a lead gen type business. And that's their second biggest market is the uae. So much so that one of the guys has moved over there. He's living there, setting the studio.
- Them: Hi.
- Me: Up, you know, it's huge. Of course, they got. They've got shed loads of money as well. That's been very realistic. But, you know, they're not short with Bobber, too. Though.
- Them: No, no. Quite. Yeah. Not shy spending, either.
- Me: No. No. I think I'm going to. Drop this spreadsheet down now while I can. See if that. If that, I'm. I'm sure you'll tell me. Anyway, if any of those budgets change, you can piss out.
- Them: Yeah, we'll do so as it is now. Is what I'll show to Seb and then. Yeah. I can't see. That you can change much more. Without really kind of just going. Just do the kind of minimum everywhere.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Then.
- Me: So. There's no demands in there yet. Then. Will there be separate demands for the individual channels?
- Them: Yeah, I've got them on a separate tab. So I've got the total demand. There's a paid search tab. Fourth one in from the left.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I've got some total demand in.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: There. Yeah. Below it is demand by market, Obviously. Rest of the world hasn't got one because it hasn't got a budget, but. Those are the total demands for the months.
- Me: For Google Ads.
- Them: Yeah, just Google Ads.
- Me: Right. Okay? I'll use that for the strategy from the 29th. I try and get it changed as quickly as possible around that time so we don't overrun at all because we'd be on big spend on the 20 eigth.
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: We were going to go away between Christmas and New Year, and we're not now. We're just going to have days out and stuff, so I'm going to be around in that, in that time.
- Them: I mean, I'll be on, so if there's any. Anything. You need me to do? Just drop me a. Drop me a line. Yeah, I'll be around the whole time.
- Me: And then we'll be back in full flow by the fifth anyway, won't we? Before. The european. Yeah, okay.
- Them: Yeah. Awesome.
- Me: Okay, dockey.
- Them: Cool. I'll let you know. If there's any changes after talking to Seab tomorrow. But otherwise, those. Yeah, as we are. Those are the numbers in there.
- Me: Great.
- Them: And then I'll give you a shout once all text adds are done. And I'll give you drop your message as well when all the assets are in the library.
- Me: Fantastic. I need. I mean, I'll be around on. On Christmas Eve. It should be a fairly simple job. Because I'm going to do all the prep first for putting the text assets up from those spreadsheets. So if you want me to do any of the sales stuff, Just. Just let me know. Pick a country, and I'll just whack them in there. Are you just going to do? Is it just three creatives? Just with the three different ratios.
- Them: I wish. No, they've got, like. The way they've done it is they've given me, like, five. Five of each. Ratio. And I'm just going to put them all into every category. Into every.
- Me: Right, so you've only got 20.
- Them: Something like that. Yeah. So what I wanted was just a graphic, really. That I could just put in, but that's not what they want to do. So I've got.
- Me: So you're going to replace all the stuff that's in there already?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Oh, wow. I'm busy that day. Mate.
- Them: It won't take too much longer to replace it.
- Me: But at least it can just all be zapped. Because once you pop, once you go into it, It shows you at the bottom what they are, and you're just basically clicking them out, aren't you?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Then just dropping in the ones from the library that I've got.
- Me: Don't. Don't forget. Sorry. Don't forget on your library. I think you did this last time. Create yourself a fold. And that makes it. It makes it really easy, then.
- Them: Yes. I've got Winter south phase one. So that's in the UK one already. And it looks like I've got six assets for each. One, two, three. Okay, I've got six. Square six.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Portrait. And then five. One, two, three. No, six of each. Okay, fine. So I'm just going to. Probably put. Because the way they've done this is they've not been like, oh, here's your ones for this one, here's your ones for that one. They just got his. His six images.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: So I'm going to put them across and the wording just says up to 50 off. So I'm just going to put them all in, everything.
- Me: Good. Yeah.
- Them: None of this, like trying to be like the bad one. Only goes in bags like it's a bloody sale. We'll just put it. In. Unless you prefer.
- Me: No, I'm just thinking. I'm just thinking whether you can select all of. The campaigns.
- Them: Dump these assets into all of these.
- Me: Yeah. So assets. Can I zip this to p max? Let's screw it up. Once you just Once you've done them, just give us a shout. I'll sense check it for you. Once it's done.
- Them: Yes. Oh, I know. I'll have a Guinness or a glass of wine, and I'll just go through.
- Me: That's what I'm worried. About?
- Them: Yeah. They'll be done quick enough.
- Me: Cool. All right. Then.
- Them: Good. Oh, and I'll also. I'm just. Going to make a copy of the markdown sheet, and I'll just have you just want product name and product skew.
- Me: Just scoop.
- Them: I'll just send you the list of the SKUs.
- Me: Okay. Uk us.
- Them: Let me see what they've done. Right. All currents. It looks like it's all the same. There's no original or market differences.
- Me: Great.
- Them: So I'm just going to send you the skewer. This. This entire sku list.
- Me: And these are what? These are all the same amount? Of.
- Them: No. Do you want that?
- Me: Yes.
- Them: So I've got markdown discount percentage column as well.
- Me: Right. Okay. Well, I'll consult it then, can't I?
- Them: Yeah. So let me. Yeah, so it is. Some of this is old markdown where it was reduced up to 60, but once you're not. Communicating that at a minute.
- Me: Because each. Each markdown percentage is going to need a different promotion.
- Them: So can you. Clock. So some of them are, like, 50%, obviously. Some of them were 40%. Some of them are 33%.
- Me: Let me have a look.
- Them: Because obviously where it's up, up to.
- Me: I'm not too sure what I can do an up. To. You can do it on a you can do it on a promotion extension, but in the. Yeah, it's a specific percentage off.
- Them: Well. If we do, we overlay like. The performance to date of these products. So, like, if the heroes and sidekicks. Would that only surface the good ones within it or. So I'm just trying to think how.
- Me: The easiest way is just to sort it and just create individual promotions for it.
- Them: It gets simpler. Yeah, I don't think there's that many different ones.
- Me: That's fine. Well, we're far enough out. It's not as though it's. It's Wednesday. You know, I've got time to do it.
- Them: Yeah. Let me just save this down and I get this.
- Me: No, I can. Yes, I can. So it's up to 60% then, is it?
- Them: Technically, but the messaging is up to 50. It will go into up to 60, but the messaging is. Is up to 50.
- Me: Right. Okay?
- Them: Because there is stuff that 60 off. But that was the stuff that, like in the Somerset, I always put 60 and we can't put it back down.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: So we have to keep it at that. Higher price, but it's not the messaging that we go with.
- Me: It's fine. I can do. I can do up to 50 off.
- Them: Nice, okay?
- Me: And then now going on Christmas Day and change it again because it will reject it, and then.
- Them: Yeah. Well, you should have that.
- Me: Come. On. Right. So those are. Those are true, right across the board, aren't they? So us and uk, nice. Create. Copy of. That. Thank you.
- Them: Yeah. I'll give you. There should be any other changes to that. Now, that should just be pretty much. Done.
- Me: Nice. And it's less than a thousand. So if it's more than 1000 SKUs, I have to split them over a number of different promotions. So that's good. It's 700. Odd.
- Them: Okay, good. Makes life easy.
- Me: Now. Okay? I think we have a plan.
- Them: Good stuff, Right? Okay, so I'm going to use my next 10 minutes makeup.
- Me: Use wise. Ly.
- Them: Yeah. And I'll just update you on the other two bits. In.
- Me: Fantastic.
- Them: As and when they're done.
- Me: All right.
- Them: Good. I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Me: Speak to you later in the week.
- Them: It's a bit.
- Me: Bye now.
- Them: Bye.

--- Full Transcript ---

Me: Yes. Why are we still having this problem with the product feeds location? My understanding is that the Christmas Eve sale was UK only. Double check this. Normally for Christmas delivery. All right. Mate. There we go.
Them: I'm not going to say it. There we go.
Me: Hello. It's just ready for the. Ready for Christmas. Mate. I'm just wasted. Absolutely wasted.
Them: It's only one I can look.
Me: I know. It's been a bit of a roller coaster, this, isn't it?
Them: Yep. What is this?
Me: We're getting there, though, mate. It's looking promising.
Them: Yeah. Good on new customers again.
Me: Is it? Oh, that's good.
Them: It's got to be the non brand stuff. Because the key difference year on year is the mix between brand and non brand sperm, particularly in the uk.
Me: Right. Right, okay.
Them: So new customers. From non brand paid search was up 64% versus last year.
Me: Lovely. Wow.
Them: Not bad.
Me: Yeah, well, the icing on the cake will be to hit the revenue target. Then.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Fingers crossed on that one.
Them: Quite. And it's going to be. Hard. Tricky now until christmas eve.
Me: Yeah, this morning. I've reduced the budgets. I'm keeping my powder dry.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So the whole thing is spending two grand a day at the moment. And then the strategy is. Let me just get.
Them: What is in all accounts. Or account.
Me: So. Two grand today, three grand tomorrow. So as soon as. Sorry. Two grand today, two grand tomorrow. Three grand on. Christmas eve. I'll probably leave it at three grand for Christmas Day. And then we're up to 10 on Boxing Day. And then we're just going to basically piss the budget away. From that point onwards, whatever's left.
Them: S.
Me: Will be allocated. I've done two changes today.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I'd already scheduled some changes to take it down to 2k, but I've done a bit of jiggling around because the diaries have started kicking quite dramatically. So I've just shifted money within accounts towards the diaries because they're starting to get a decent roas. But there are assets for P9. They're fantastic. 6, 39 for the UK, 9, 48 for the US, 8, 78 for Europe and 5, 54 for the rest of the world. So that's a blended roas of 7:56 for p9. Which is. Yeah, I never would have thought it.
Them: With no double conversion counting either.
Me: That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. Yes, it does make a difference, doesn't it? When this kicks in. Some of those. Will go up to. Let's just see. So boxing day last year. Was 1, 200 for the uk, 1600 to the us. 2,900 for Europe and Bristol wasn't in the game. So if we can get just anywhere near that, then we've hit the target.
Them: Yeah, it was a good week overall as well.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Certainly from online. I don't know about stores.
Me: Well. It was taking stuff down at the beginning of the week was the worry, because the UK didn't seem to be doing very well. But there seems to be a lot of last minute traffic. I pulled it down today. We talked about it didn't with it, probably from today it will drop. And looking at the conversion rates from last year, that bears the whole thing out. So rather than throw money at stuff that's not going to convert as well, might as well just pull our horns in and wait for the big bang.
Them: Yeah.
Me: As far as. The assets are concerned. So you're going to have the. Do you think by the end of today, the text assets will be done?
Them: Yeah. Today. Text assets be done and. The creatives will be uploaded to all of the accounts.
Me: Okay? So then they'll just need allocating to the individual campaigns.
Them: Yeah. Which I presume that I'll just do on christmas eve. Because obviously, I presume, once you hit save, they'll start serving.
Me: As soon as you're. What you can do is you can load them up into the Asset Studio asset library, the main one for each account. So then when you go into the individual campaigns and select them, that's when they start showing, so you can actually upload the creative.
Them: Yeah, I'll do that today.
Me: First. Great. Okay?
Them: Yeah, I'll put it into the folders to that end of the library.
Me: Brilliant.
Them: And then what I'll do is I will start putting them in about an hour, putting them live about an hour before I think we're going to go.
Me: Okay? Okay?
Them: Because it's going to take. Bit of time anyway.
Me: They won't serve instantly.
Them: No. And even if they do, it's going to be the odd person that will see it and it doesn't matter.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And it's not going to be the key thing. It's not going to be someone who's shopping in the store. The chances someone in the UK seeing the PMAX asset while they're shopping in the store.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: Yeah, so just try and get myself some favors.
Me: Just say this Hallucinating or something? And what they're going to do about it. Start the rebound. Is it?
Them: Well, no, it's just part of life, so.
Me: They're in the store because they've gotten to buy their wife's present and they need something there and then, don't they?
Them: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Otherwise, why are you shopping solo and Christmas Eve?
Me: Y. Es.
Them: Lose it. Yes, that's fine. So all text assets should be done today. Everything uploaded into the libraries today. That's another thing. I have got a markdown list for you if you want to do. A promo. Not code base, though.
Me: Yeah. Great. Okay?
Them: If it matters. Mark. Down.
Me: Get that loaded today and get it ready.
Them: Yeah. Cool. What I'll do is I've got an Excel sheet I'll put it into. Last time, isn't it? You said attachment. Enough.
Me: The Excel spreadsheet's fine. I can work for them. I just save it as a copy. Because it's your SharePoint Excel, isn't it?
Them: Yeah, yeah. Cool. All right. Now I just won't do it on the web version, so I think that was didn't work. Fine. So I'd get that sent over.
Me: Could you also send me the sale URL?
Them: Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Now.
Me: Because I'm going to create a promotion extension for it. Which is a winter sale. 50% off selected lines. So 50% up to 50% off selected styles. Sorry. Styles it is.
Them: Up to. Yeah, I'm just going to send you all the. Europe we don't need at the minute.
Me: Still started catching up. Yet.
Them: I don't think so.
Me: It's not a last minute job, then it's not shifted. When the peak is right, it's just not coming. Right.
Them: It's just more miserable. For them, I think.
Me: Right.
Them: So I think this is. Okay? So that's fine. That's fine. Yeah. So I guess with Europe, we just don't do anything really until the 6th. As we just kind of.
Me: Well, that's what I wanted to confirm. You.
Them: Sits.
Me: At 6:00 on the 24th. We've got everything. But we got uk, US and rest of world going into sale. Right, okay. For some reason, I've not got that written down. Anyway, it doesn't make any difference. That's fine. So the assets are going to change for those three regions.
Them: Yeah, and I believe. The European websites are just going to stay in their current Christmassy themes anyway.
Me: Okay? But they'll use that sale. That sale URL be live.
Them: Europe. They'll just get a holding page if anyone in Europe tries to search for sale. So basically we just won't touch the Europe account, apart from probably to just. If we can obviously reallocate. Steadily reallocate budget, then great.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Otherwise.
Me: That's exactly what I'm doing. There's all sorts of shuffling around going on.
Them: Yeah. Otherwise we don't need to touch Europe between now and the sixth, to be honest. I put all the tech assets in there anyway.
Me: Okay?
Them: Just so it's ready, but, yeah, there's nothing to be done.
Me: So US, UK, row live, 4 o'clock on the 24th. So that's obviously regardless of time zone, really, isn't it?
Them: On bgmt. It'll just be when Seb gives us the nod, which is normally between 4 and 6.
Me: Right.
Them: But as I say,
Me: It's like the teacher saying, when you can go home. The guy opposite me is an assistant head, and it's his job to say what time the kids can go on the last day. And even tell me what time it's going to be.
Them: I think last year because I always host Christmas Eve and everyone comes around at 6. And I definitely wasn't working by then.
Me: Right.
Them: But I think from five I'm going to start doing the work.
Me: Okay?
Them: Just because if I wait until six, everybody else will press their buttons and then I'll be sat here till seven. On my own. I think we just put a live five, if not earlier, but I'll confirm.
Me: You're not doing that, are you? You're not going into.
Them: No, not in now till. Six.
Me: Right.
Them: That's fine.
Me: Okay?
Them: Oh, I have got some. If we're all good on the 24th. Then. I did get some updates from. Fearless leaders at Oakley, which is fun. So I started doing budget, demand and spend for P. 10, 11 and 12.
Me: Okay?
Them: And then Sepp turned around to me and said, you need to cut out all your additional spending.
Me: Okay?
Them: And this doesn't apply to Google, because I'm just not. I've just ignored him. And you need to fire me. Some savings. I was like,
Me: Just.
Them: So I basically just said to poor old Pay who works on Meta that you need to give me some money.
Me: Right.
Them: So we do have new. Google numbers. The budget.
Me: Is that on that same. Same spreadsheet?
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Rows 22 and 23. Although I'm thinking. On 1747.
Me: Please.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Of course. I'll put it in this chat in Archer.
Me: Not let me access that.
Them: Let me. Do another. One. I should send you an email in a sec.
Me: You have to sell yourself with this, don't you?
Them: Yep.
Me: Understandably. Come. On. There we go. So this isn't up to date, then?
Them: They are now. So I've just stripped everything back.
Me: So178. That's your whole lot. That's sorry. Now it's a whole lot.
Them: Yes, if you look.
Me: Gotcha172. 117. Down it goes.
Them: Well.
Me: 1 1.
Them: Yeah. Gets more miserable the more you go down in it. There you go. In the green.
Me: So 117419. I don't. Possible question is that likely to change?
Them: Definitely not after. Tomorrow.
Me: Okay?
Them: Well, I mean, I've saved him. 75 grand. So, I mean, he can kind of. Leave it alone. Now.
Me: Yeah. Well, hopefully they'll be happy with the Google Ad stuff over.
Them: This is it. But they're just like. I nearly said. Something could be on PC, but.
Me: Go for it.
Them: Just going to say they're just autistic, aren't they? It's just like, what? This to this, to this, to this. And they'll see a good performance and they'll go, Can you. Can you do a bit more of that?
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: And you go. But you've literally just asked me to give you all the money back.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: Yeah, but we've had a good couple of weeks. So can we keep. Talking to children sometimes.
Me: I genuinely did not think we'd be anywhere near the revenue target. We're not there yet, but I really didn't think it was going to be anywhere near what they wanted. But unfortunately, as you say, if you do it so then if you do do it, so what can you do? Can you do some more of that then? Well, no, I've had sleepless nights as it is getting to this stage.
Them: Yeah. You've just made me spend two days, figure out how I'm going to. Give you a lot of money back without bleeding sales.
Me: Y. Es. Yeah.
Them: So I bet you that happens. But I'm going to give it. Give the numbers to Seb tomorrow. And just say, there you go. Well, there's your saving. So you've had best of both worlds now because we've done better than you thought and got some money saved, but don't come back to me.
Me: Yeah.
Them: In February when you plan basically.
Me: Yeah. Because that's going to be a big drop as well. Isn't that 47 in February?
Them: But almost February and March are a bit like maintenance modes because they're so just. The business isn't hugely seasonal, but February, March are just shit. You can't really. Summer it starts to pick up again.
Me: I say it's better off spending the money when you can, when you, you know it's going to come back. But the weird thing is we've just sudden got all this data on Europe and rest of the world. To play around with where they been doing well.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And then all of a sudden, we're going to stop it. That's going to be a hard one. I think one thing I'd like to do. Or could you. Could you have a word with Beth again about that? I know she'd be busy if she can do the salesforce stuff. The API stuff before. Before we finish for Christmas. It'd be great because then I'll have a play with it over Christmas then.
Them: Okay?
Me: I just want to. I want to do some analysis on. We. We already use the hero psychics, villains and zombies for the UK and the US. We don't do for Europe and the rest of the world because there's not enough traffic there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And they're, you know, there's not enough traffic for individual countries, but I'd like to do some analysis on individual products that sell in Google Ads. For those countries and do some filtering on those. So we may not be advertising the whole of the the catalog for those countries. Difficult because, you know, diaries do have the spike, don't they? You know, they get spike, November, December, January, in fact.
Them: Yeah.
Me: There's many. Middle of December, it started kicking up, so we can't put too much weight on it, but at least get an idea on what products are selling. So that we're spending the money intelligently in those countries rather than just chucking the whole catalog at them. But that's the project for New Year anyway, so if she can do that, then.
Them: I'm speaking to her at two.
Me: Great.
Them: So I'll bring it up. I'll bring it out there.
Me: I think I've given her everything she needs. But if she does need anything else, just. Just get.
Them: Well, I'll just see where she is with it.
Me: Yeah. Okay?
Them: All right, fair enough. Yeah, I'll see where she's at with it. Yeah. Really on. This is a Google Analytics view of the world, so it's not. Quite. Completely scratching. Google Ads back. But non brand revenue. Was almost three. Plus 125% versus last year.
Me: Wow.
Them: In the UK for 28% extra spend. In the US we managed 70% more non brand revenue. Or 22% less spend.
Me: Wow. W. Ow.
Them: They're not going to go into the account and just have a little dig around and go, okay, because obviously you're not going to see, like, I don't mind it so much, but obviously, where analytics tells you a story, Meta tells you a story. AdWise tells you a story. But you just got to find, like, the tangential links. Never obviously find. It's a bit like the search term stuff.
Me: Yes. Yeah.
Them: I tell that I pull out certain search terms. That I think are interesting rather than I can't give them. This is 100% like you said to me the other week. You're not going to get 100% of your traffic within the search term report.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But you can get a flavor of what's good.
Me: Yes, you can. Yes, you can. And it tends to be the more successful the search term is, the more chance it's going to be to show you still get.
Them: News submission. Random shit in there as well.
Me: The brown was.
Them: You get some really random that it picks up.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think your analytics is from your perspective, analytics is probably the best. Thing to go for. Can you see new customers in analytics?
Them: You can. Yeah. But we've got, like, a single customer view. Database that sits outside of that, that is our sort of. North Star, if you like. Because as I say, as you all know, with any of these, there's all these bloody caveats, isn't there?
Me: Right.
Them: You can believe almost all of this and then almost.
Me: Oh, unless you spend a huge amount of money on attribution modeling. You just gotta. You got to go for gut feel. Sometimes it sounds horrible. Multimillion.
Them: True, though. But like rest of the wild traffic. Was 90,000 visits. And that was the. Obviously, it's not true. That was the ship from Japan and South America last week. Saw those bits. You go right on a bit of paper somewhere and remember it for next year.
Me: Yes, you do, because it screws up your conversion rate.
Them: Yeah. So I'm trying to get Mike, who produces a dashboards. To one way or another. Take that shit out.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Or even if he just gives me an average of the last two weeks and uses that for this week, that's going to be a hell of a lot. So he reckons we have 90,000 visits versus 12,000 the week before.
Me: All from brazil. And they didn't buy a.
Them: Yeah. Not too sure. One of the girls in. The more sort of trade side said to me, we'll just use that number until we get a new one. Please don't use that number. Pete, don't do that.
Me: It'll be.
Them: That would be. Yeah, because you're not going to be able to explain it, so don't do it.
Me: No, no. Yes. It's a different matter when you stand up in front of people and actually explain what's going on as a result of that, isn't it?
Them: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And they don't have any of the context that you've got around kind of what possibly what the isms are. Doing this. But yeah. Just wait. I'll give you a number you can use, which I'm happy for you to use them, but do not say we actually got 90,000 visits because. We only managed for the whole site. We only manage about 140,000 for all of them. Uk, us, Europe. So come on, there's no way rest of oil is not 90.
Me: I think. I think that's the thing that comes with experience, isn't it? When you're doing a sanity check, it takes your downsight. Quicker doing it, the more experience you've had.
Them: Oh, yeah.
Me: You figure, oh, isn't this amazing? You look at it going. No, it's not actually. It can't possibly be very high. It's one thing I'm finding with AI Is. Is that you need to. You need to sanity check it a hell of a lot. You know it will just say, no, this is definitely right, and you go, really? And you almost say that. Really? Oh, no, you're quite right. Yes. I've forgotten about this, this, this and this.
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah, well, I'm definitely using it a lot more now as well.
Me: I'm. I'm loving it now. It's. It's playing. It plays funny beggars every now and again, but the system is finally coming together. And certainly for doing. I'm looking forward to next year, the sort of depth of analysis I'm going to be able to do. At product level. Will be just phenomenal. You know? I think one of the problems, especially when working with a customer for a long time, you have assumptions, and it looks at it from a very cold perspective. It only looks at the numbers. It has no emotion whatsoever.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it heard from that perspect. If I say to it about. You know, about roas. I want the campaigns with the highest roas. Then for budget increases, it will absolutely do that. You have to apply the nuance to it to say, well, actually, I think Dari's gonna do quite well. Now go back and look at it seasonally and apply the budgets that way. So you've got to give it a real direction.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: The longer it goes, the bigger the knowledge base on the sites becomes. And that's the value. That's the real value. You know, if you imagine if you were to do that over 10 years, It would be absolutely nailed on. Apart from little lips on it. It would. It would completely understand it.
Them: Be nice. Actually, I'm looking forward to annualizing some of this. Rest of the world performance because at the minute. It's just 6,000%. 10,000% plus 7.
Me: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's not great. The ROAS compared with the others isn't as good, but it's still 539% and it's still incremental business. So it has value to the business, but not necessarily as a roas. So got to be careful in a situation like this where we're going for the campaigns with the highest roas us not to exclude rest of the world completely. It's almost like saying that we, we need a minimum percentage spend of the budget going to each of those four regions. And then based on that, go and go and allocate the budgets.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But it's what basis you do that on. You know, and that's, that's far too deep a question because that's then going to the marketing department, say, how much do you want to spend, percentage wise, on the rest of the world? And they go, we haven't got a bloody clue. Absolutely no idea.
Them: Yeah. Well, we'll have more of an proper budget for rest of the world, so we didn't have one for this year. It was just. Let's try and do something.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So at least we've set a baseline so spent X generated wide in for next year. We know. What's realistic.
Me: Well, I'll do. I'll do it. I mean, there's all sorts of reports to come, but I'll do a breakdown in the new year of actual locations. So it's a big bucket for rest of the world is Australia is a separate campaign. The rest is just one big bucket. So I should be able to split that out into the individual countries.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And come up with an idea of which ones are doing well and which ones aren't. So if you think. If you think it's been launched as a scatter gun. It's actually not done too bad, has it? It's not been restricted any sort of way to specific areas. I don't. I think we don't do like Nigeria and the Philippines and things like, you know, the way they're known scam places, but the rest of it is pretty broad. And yet it still managed to do that High roas. So the long term, it's looking quite good for that, that we will be able to narrow it down and really, really batter those individual areas.
Them: Yeah. And you do see the same locations. So if we ever wanted to kind of sort of keep expanding it, You know, it's always your Australia's and your Singapores, Hong Kong, uae.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Those tend to be the ones that we see conversions for, like, every week in, in ads.
Me: Yeah. That'd be.
Them: Particularly Australia.
Me: Great. Sorry. Say again?
Them: Particularly Australia. That's the third.
Me: Yes.
Them: Biggest international market after the US.
Me: Is it really? Wow.
Them: We don't do any marketing specifically to that audience either.
Me: That's potentially X parts. Then.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, and it'll be the language as well, so. And then, like the UAE thing, Singapore is a bit of expats, isn't it? And a bit of like, you know, it's very Western. The UAE is kind of from that side of the world. Have always kind of love that.
Me: Yeah.
Them: British kind of heritage stuff.
Me: I have a client who does interior design courses, so it's a lead gen type business. And that's their second biggest market is the uae. So much so that one of the guys has moved over there. He's living there, setting the studio.
Them: Hi.
Me: Up, you know, it's huge. Of course, they got. They've got shed loads of money as well. That's been very realistic. But, you know, they're not short with Bobber, too. Though.
Them: No, no. Quite. Yeah. Not shy spending, either.
Me: No. No. I think I'm going to. Drop this spreadsheet down now while I can. See if that. If that, I'm. I'm sure you'll tell me. Anyway, if any of those budgets change, you can piss out.
Them: Yeah, we'll do so as it is now. Is what I'll show to Seb and then. Yeah. I can't see. That you can change much more. Without really kind of just going. Just do the kind of minimum everywhere.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Then.
Me: So. There's no demands in there yet. Then. Will there be separate demands for the individual channels?
Them: Yeah, I've got them on a separate tab. So I've got the total demand. There's a paid search tab. Fourth one in from the left.
Me: Okay?
Them: I've got some total demand in.
Me: Yeah.
Them: There. Yeah. Below it is demand by market, Obviously. Rest of the world hasn't got one because it hasn't got a budget, but. Those are the total demands for the months.
Me: For Google Ads.
Them: Yeah, just Google Ads.
Me: Right. Okay? I'll use that for the strategy from the 29th. I try and get it changed as quickly as possible around that time so we don't overrun at all because we'd be on big spend on the 20 eigth.
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: We were going to go away between Christmas and New Year, and we're not now. We're just going to have days out and stuff, so I'm going to be around in that, in that time.
Them: I mean, I'll be on, so if there's any. Anything. You need me to do? Just drop me a. Drop me a line. Yeah, I'll be around the whole time.
Me: And then we'll be back in full flow by the fifth anyway, won't we? Before. The european. Yeah, okay.
Them: Yeah. Awesome.
Me: Okay, dockey.
Them: Cool. I'll let you know. If there's any changes after talking to Seab tomorrow. But otherwise, those. Yeah, as we are. Those are the numbers in there.
Me: Great.
Them: And then I'll give you a shout once all text adds are done. And I'll give you drop your message as well when all the assets are in the library.
Me: Fantastic. I need. I mean, I'll be around on. On Christmas Eve. It should be a fairly simple job. Because I'm going to do all the prep first for putting the text assets up from those spreadsheets. So if you want me to do any of the sales stuff, Just. Just let me know. Pick a country, and I'll just whack them in there. Are you just going to do? Is it just three creatives? Just with the three different ratios.
Them: I wish. No, they've got, like. The way they've done it is they've given me, like, five. Five of each. Ratio. And I'm just going to put them all into every category. Into every.
Me: Right, so you've only got 20.
Them: Something like that. Yeah. So what I wanted was just a graphic, really. That I could just put in, but that's not what they want to do. So I've got.
Me: So you're going to replace all the stuff that's in there already?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Oh, wow. I'm busy that day. Mate.
Them: It won't take too much longer to replace it.
Me: But at least it can just all be zapped. Because once you pop, once you go into it, It shows you at the bottom what they are, and you're just basically clicking them out, aren't you?
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Then just dropping in the ones from the library that I've got.
Me: Don't. Don't forget. Sorry. Don't forget on your library. I think you did this last time. Create yourself a fold. And that makes it. It makes it really easy, then.
Them: Yes. I've got Winter south phase one. So that's in the UK one already. And it looks like I've got six assets for each. One, two, three. Okay, I've got six. Square six.
Me: Okay?
Them: Portrait. And then five. One, two, three. No, six of each. Okay, fine. So I'm just going to. Probably put. Because the way they've done this is they've not been like, oh, here's your ones for this one, here's your ones for that one. They just got his. His six images.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: So I'm going to put them across and the wording just says up to 50 off. So I'm just going to put them all in, everything.
Me: Good. Yeah.
Them: None of this, like trying to be like the bad one. Only goes in bags like it's a bloody sale. We'll just put it. In. Unless you prefer.
Me: No, I'm just thinking. I'm just thinking whether you can select all of. The campaigns.
Them: Dump these assets into all of these.
Me: Yeah. So assets. Can I zip this to p max? Let's screw it up. Once you just Once you've done them, just give us a shout. I'll sense check it for you. Once it's done.
Them: Yes. Oh, I know. I'll have a Guinness or a glass of wine, and I'll just go through.
Me: That's what I'm worried. About?
Them: Yeah. They'll be done quick enough.
Me: Cool. All right. Then.
Them: Good. Oh, and I'll also. I'm just. Going to make a copy of the markdown sheet, and I'll just have you just want product name and product skew.
Me: Just scoop.
Them: I'll just send you the list of the SKUs.
Me: Okay. Uk us.
Them: Let me see what they've done. Right. All currents. It looks like it's all the same. There's no original or market differences.
Me: Great.
Them: So I'm just going to send you the skewer. This. This entire sku list.
Me: And these are what? These are all the same amount? Of.
Them: No. Do you want that?
Me: Yes.
Them: So I've got markdown discount percentage column as well.
Me: Right. Okay. Well, I'll consult it then, can't I?
Them: Yeah. So let me. Yeah, so it is. Some of this is old markdown where it was reduced up to 60, but once you're not. Communicating that at a minute.
Me: Because each. Each markdown percentage is going to need a different promotion.
Them: So can you. Clock. So some of them are, like, 50%, obviously. Some of them were 40%. Some of them are 33%.
Me: Let me have a look.
Them: Because obviously where it's up, up to.
Me: I'm not too sure what I can do an up. To. You can do it on a you can do it on a promotion extension, but in the. Yeah, it's a specific percentage off.
Them: Well. If we do, we overlay like. The performance to date of these products. So, like, if the heroes and sidekicks. Would that only surface the good ones within it or. So I'm just trying to think how.
Me: The easiest way is just to sort it and just create individual promotions for it.
Them: It gets simpler. Yeah, I don't think there's that many different ones.
Me: That's fine. Well, we're far enough out. It's not as though it's. It's Wednesday. You know, I've got time to do it.
Them: Yeah. Let me just save this down and I get this.
Me: No, I can. Yes, I can. So it's up to 60% then, is it?
Them: Technically, but the messaging is up to 50. It will go into up to 60, but the messaging is. Is up to 50.
Me: Right. Okay?
Them: Because there is stuff that 60 off. But that was the stuff that, like in the Somerset, I always put 60 and we can't put it back down.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: So we have to keep it at that. Higher price, but it's not the messaging that we go with.
Me: It's fine. I can do. I can do up to 50 off.
Them: Nice, okay?
Me: And then now going on Christmas Day and change it again because it will reject it, and then.
Them: Yeah. Well, you should have that.
Me: Come. On. Right. So those are. Those are true, right across the board, aren't they? So us and uk, nice. Create. Copy of. That. Thank you.
Them: Yeah. I'll give you. There should be any other changes to that. Now, that should just be pretty much. Done.
Me: Nice. And it's less than a thousand. So if it's more than 1000 SKUs, I have to split them over a number of different promotions. So that's good. It's 700. Odd.
Them: Okay, good. Makes life easy.
Me: Now. Okay? I think we have a plan.
Them: Good stuff, Right? Okay, so I'm going to use my next 10 minutes makeup.
Me: Use wise. Ly.
Them: Yeah. And I'll just update you on the other two bits. In.
Me: Fantastic.
Them: As and when they're done.
Me: All right.
Them: Good. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Me: Speak to you later in the week.
Them: It's a bit.
Me: Bye now.
Them: Bye.
