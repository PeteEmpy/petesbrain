- 'Them: Peter, how are you?'
- 'Me: Yes. If I think y''all.'
- 'Them: Did you have a good weekend?'
- 'Me: See what''s good. Thanks. Yes, we went to the zoo. Once we got done.'
- 'Them: It''s in the code.'
- 'Me: For ages. It was Chester Zoo. So it''s really good. We''ve been there quite
  a few times, but not in the last. 89 years. Something like that. So it was good
  fun. Really good fun.'
- 'Them: Nice.'
- 'Me: Bit different. Alex.'
- 'Them: Hi, how are you?'
- 'Me: That was a big build up.'
- 'Them: Never find a bloody mute button, that''s why.'
- 'Me: It''s good to see we''re not on blurred background today as well.'
- 'Them: Yeah, no, I left that in the past. It was making my head look narrower than
  it actually is.'
- 'Me: Oh, right. Okay. He''s never good, is it?'
- 'Them: No, no. It doesn''t do any one new favors.'
- 'Me: Cool. It. Thing''s looking good. That one.'
- 'Them: Yeah, everything is. So we''re at 66% of the target. Yeah. Or 69 if you include
  Bing. We''re at like 60. So I''ve added a bit of extra budget on from like our under
  spends from like P5 to P7. It''s only like a couple of hundred. It''s like 1.7K
  overall, so I''ve added that on. So we''re like 60% of pacing or budget pacing.
  So we''ve got a good amount to push this week.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: So, yeah, all good.'
- 'Me: It''s the actual spends come round nicely as well from on the dashboard. You''re
  only about four grand over according to the weighted trajectory, which is great.
  I put another column on that dashboard. I mean, it''s fingering the edge up really,
  isn''t it? But I''m making it 976,000. It''s going to hit now on a target at 1.1,
  which is pretty much what was expected, wasn''t it?'
- 'Them: As in revenue.'
- 'Me: So it''s not far off.'
- 'Them: Well. Let''s see what happens with Ross and thinks this week.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, it''s saying the European one. The European account looks. Looks
  really good.'
- 'Them: Hopefully.'
- 'Me: There was very little data from that last year, so there''s not a lot to work
  on when doing a prediction. So, I mean, that''s 50 grand up on where it should have
  been. So that''s not too bad at all. It''s kind of money for nothing, isn''t it?
  And we didn''t think it was going to happen. That''s quite a result. And the US
  is doing particularly well as well. The only one I''m seeing not chucking as well
  is the uk.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s about 40 grand down, something like that. But it''s been made up for
  by the others.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''s fine. I think it''s long. As long as we''re making, you know,
  the revenue we need to. Doesn''t really matter. It comes from, but yeah. Well, if
  we continue how things are going now, What I can do on my side. We should hit 1.24.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Million. But we''ll see. Because things tended it in the middle of the week.
  So yeah. But yeah, just wanted to speak about the upcoming promos briefly. I''ve
  already put in a brief for marketing, but how it works is that they kind of tell
  us what they''re going to give us in advance. So even if I did want to request videos
  etc, when it comes to promos, they don''t they only give us statics. And then when
  it''s, like, big, like marketing, which is like diaries or Christmas, for example,
  they''ll give us videos and everything else as well, which I have stressed that
  we need video, but we''ll get into statics. So we just have to work with it. So
  for we have the gold stamping coming up. On. Just get the. Peter just on that, so.
  How much, if at all, does that change the strategy? Or the approach in Google.'
- 'Me: Well, it doesn''t really. I mean. We''re on a flight path. Really? I think
  there''s stuff I sent through this morning about the headlines was quite revealing.
  And. It gives us some opportunities just to nudge it a little bit. By pausing the
  assets that aren''t doing particularly well and replacing replacing them with more
  promotional type headlines. I think we''re at this stage now if you imagine it''s
  just like it is like a plane coming into land and we''re just making little tweaks
  here and there that may or may not make a difference to it. And I think the assets
  are quite a good one to have a look at the text assets. Because we''ve got shed
  loads of data. I mean, this time of year, we''ve got a huge amount of volume coming
  through. So it could make not a huge difference, but it could certainly make a difference
  as far as the offers are concerned. That could be interwoven into this. And I''ve
  been working on. A. Well, you know, when you sent over that space. Sorry, Lauren,
  I''m bushing your conversation here.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: I got your spreadsheet last week, just with the ones with the tick box on,
  the G sheet with the tick box on. And it''s got all the assets on text assets for
  when we revert back. Next week, next Tuesday.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That is a work in progress. But it needs to. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah, that''s fine. Yeah, that''s fine. No, it''s more about the asset. So
  I looked at the way you''ve done the text assets, and one of the real pains for
  both of us. Is to do this. Quickly. It takes a huge amount of time to redo them.
  I''ve written something that will do it. We''ll take those assets as they are in
  that format. It needs to be in that format. And it replaced the ones that are already
  there. So we''ve got the campaign names and the asset group names. In that spreadsheet.
  And then all the headlines and description lines. So if it''s in that format, this
  system will go through and read those and just go and replace it. What''s already
  there.'
- 'Them: So it will go into Google Ads and replace things.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: How bizarre. Right.'
- 'Them: That that could help issue. I think we just need to check over everything
  to make sure it does it properly.'
- 'Me: Definitely. So what I''ve built into it is I built a check into it, and I''ve
  also built in a rollback, so it takes a copy before it does it, and then I can go
  and have a look at it. And I think the best way is. Drop down to Google Ads editor.
  Then run it. And then drop it down to Google Ads Editors again, and then it will
  show you in green exactly what''s been changed. So we''ll know implicitly.'
- 'Them: So it''s like a script.'
- 'Me: What''s changed between those two moments?'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: But it should be pretty quick to do it. And the strategy is basically do one.
  On the Tuesday, and if that works okay and happy with it, then just blast through
  and do all the others. It''s just things like all the European ones, they''re just
  an absolute nightmare to do, and it will just mean that we''re a bit more thorough.
  Or I''m a bit more thorough with doing it, and I can do it on all of them if you
  want me to do the whole lot, but I can do. Because it''s the same process for all
  of them.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I don''t have an issue with, like, making things more efficient. I
  think that''s always a good thing to do, as long as it''s, like, efficient and accurate.
  Yeah. So let''s try it, and then if it works and it''s fine, then, yeah, we can
  implement it across everything. Maybe.'
- 'Me: I can sit down with diary for 8 o''clock next Tuesday and run it through. And
  if there''s anything you want to change, you can go Street into those G sheets and
  change the headlines and descriptions if you wanted to.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, that''s fine. With the G sheet as it is right now, I just want
  to change everything to sentence case, because there''s still things in there that
  are, like, all capitals, and we just want to make everything consistent so before
  it goes back in.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Great.'
- 'Them: As we''ve had, like, Black Friday, I think it''s, you know, sentence case,
  so, yeah. I''ll be doing that this week. And just make sure you''ve got all the
  efforts and everything for us to put everything back in. In terms of the visual
  assets. Will it. Will the script that you''re creating be able to do that as well
  with. Okay, we have to do that. That''s fine.'
- 'Me: The images are always going to be a problem because. It''s getting into it
  via the API is quite difficult and. There''s no way of identifying the system, identifying
  what images are going to go where. It is a very much a visual thing.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: It''s certainly something that can be looked at going forward. If the image
  just off the top of my head, if the image was called the campaign name and the asset
  group, then potentially it could drop it in there. Because it would know exactly
  where to do it. So, for instance, on the asset group spreadsheet, if there were
  other columns next to it that actually had the name of the asset, In it. The image
  asset, then it could possibly pull those in and do it. But I don''t know about that.
  And I think we''re in Black Friday week now. I think it would be dangerous for us
  to do any experimentation as far as the images, because it''s already been seen
  to be a little bit not flaky, but it''s a bit more complicated. The text is something
  we can change very quick, very well, relatively easily, whereas the images. There''s
  a bit more to it because there''s folders and things that it needs to sit in. Does
  it need to be in the asset library? Can we access it? And all those bits and pieces.
  So eventually, yes, probably.'
- 'Them: Okay? Cool. That''s fine. While in the court, I''ll go through permissions
  of a min. If there''s, like any other, I guess, operational bits, we can go through
  that tomorrow. Don''t want to have a catch up. But, yeah, I started responding to
  your asset reviews. Thank you. I''ll just respond properly after.'
- 'Me: Sure. Yeah, yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: But, yeah, read through it and everything, so, yeah. Thank.'
- 'Me: So if you want me to. If you want me to whiz through those and make some changes,
  then I can certainly do that.'
- 'Them: You. Okay, let me respond to you, and then we can go from there.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: So, yeah, we''ve got gold stamping. On the 6th and 7th of December when we
  had a gold stamping a horror in October. I pinned RSAs and we had site links live.
  But I think we can take that a step further this time and have some promotional
  extensions as well. And permission on Merchant Center. And then I''ve also requested
  image extensions.'
- 'Me: So what date was that again?'
- 'Them: So. 6 and 7th of December.'
- 'Me: Ok, ok.'
- 'Them: I just need to see if it''s. If there''s a skew list for it. Alex, do you
  know if there''s going to be. If it''s going to be free gold stamping on everything.
  Well, it''s only. Yeah. There''s only set skus that can be gold stamped anyway.
  Yeah. A couple of weeks ago. So I''ll just double check that. Yes, it''ll be the
  same list as from the gold stamping promo we run recently. Cool. That''s fine. So,
  yeah, all the gold stamping and then we have 20 off notebooks on the 8th to the
  14th of December, so again, we''ll have pinned our C headline for notebooks. Slightly
  expirational extensions. Permissions on Merchant Center. And. Yeah, image extensions.
  We don''t know. We''ll have a visual on. I''ll just check. I''ll put it in.'
- 'Me: So we''re going to do that.'
- 'Them: The. List.'
- 'Me: Am I going to learn my lesson from last time with the merchant center to actually
  drop these in as IDS into merchant center for the promotions rather than trying
  to do it in one big spreadsheet? Really don''t want to go through that pain again.'
- 'Them: I mean. I mean. I''ll. I''d love to have a go at it and see how it works.
  I try and practice it.'
- 'Me: If you want to lose a few hours of your life, then that''s fine.'
- 'Them: And try and do the spreadsheet.'
- 'Me: The idea one is, ok, you can literally just cut and paste them in. It''s just
  when you''re going to do. If you were to do it as a promotional spreadsheet,'
- 'Them: Here.'
- 'Me: Complete. That''s when it starts to get wobbly. That''s where it screwed up
  last time.'
- 'Them: Don''t you have to just create the promotion manually on Merchant center
  and then put that promotional ID along with the item ID and then put the. Spreadsheet
  into the supplemental feeds.'
- 'Me: No. If you''re going to create it manually on Merchant center, you create it
  manually and then it says, how do you want to identify which products they are?
  You just cut and paste the product IDS in there as a list.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: The way it was done. The way it was done the first time was to do it as one
  big spreadsheet which sets up the actual promotion itself, along with all the ids.
  And that''s where it just got ridiculous. That''s where you got complicated. And
  that''s when I backed out of eventually.'
- 'Them: So it. ''s just. Okay, so it''s just better to do it manually, but use a
  list of. Okay, that''s fine.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: I can have a go at that and see how that goes. So. Yeah, that''s a notebooks.
  And then everything else. During this time will be back to Christmas. And then we''ve
  got the winter sale. So again, it will just be like a Black Friday kind of graphic.
  Across p max. We can pause. I''ll say we can pause a Christmas gifting campaigns
  then, because they will no longer be relevant. But we''ll. We can still put in the
  Winter cell graphic into the regular hero fragits. Emma''s campaign that adds like
  all the different product groups. We can reactivate gifting in there because that''s
  gifting that all, like, just be like a different gifting moments in the year and
  different promotions.'
- 'Me: It''s a good idea to leave.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We just kind of like. What''s the word I''m looking for?
  Falling back a little bit. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And we''ll have. Yeah. Site links. Promotions. Promotions. Merch and center
  again. Image extensions. And we can also pull some of the gifting campaigns that
  we''ve had live in a year. And rest of world by that point as well. Because Christmas
  will be over. A note on gifting. That we will all need to stop on the last delivery
  dates. Yeah, so I''ve got delivery dates as well. Yeah, so we''ll stop communicating
  that just because otherwise people are end up buying stuff on the 22nd. It''s not
  going to get them. So we just need to make sure that all gifted related ad support
  on their respective countries last dates. And we can roll back to any sort of autumn,
  winter BAU messaging. For the four five days before we go into the Christmas sale.
  Oh, that''s fine.'
- 'Me: It''s nice that most of the stuff is in the Christmas gift. Campaigns, isn''t
  it? They can just be. Literally just pause. We could even set a rule to pause. Them.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. I''m just looking for the delivery day email so I can just screenshot
  and send.'
- 'Me: Is there a very specific last delivery date? Last order date.'
- 'Them: Yeah, there''s, like, different order dates for the different market.'
- 'Me: Ok? So can we do countdown timers on those?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, we can. And speaking of that, wanted to do countdown timers for
  Black Friday as well. I just haven''t seen over like a. Draft of it for Alex to
  see and see. It''s okay. When do we want to do that? By well. If it ends. If it''s
  ending on Monday, then that''ll do it. From tomorrow and be that. Like. Would that
  be so? Indeed. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Yeah. If we do it from tomorrow, then
  we can say Black Friday ends in seven days. Or sell ends in seven. Well, yeah, it
  wouldn''t be Black Friday anymore, but yeah, we can do so. And in seven days. Or
  I need to see what. What goes into the character count. 30 characters.'
- 'Me: Could I suggest?'
- 'Them: Is it dynamic? Sorry, Peter. Yeah, so it changes based on the date of the
  week. It will change to six days and then five days, etc.'
- 'Me: Could I suggest you start the countdown on the Street Because to say that the
  Black Friday sale ends and we''ve not even got to Black Friday yet. People know
  where Black Friday is. We''ve started it on the Street to say from clicking over
  from midnight on Street say Black Friday sales sends ends on Monday at midnight
  then at least that''s what you''re saying to people is there is still a Black Friday
  sale on, even though it isn''t black. Friday. I know everybody does it, but at least
  it would add some urgency. Then from the Street through to the Monday.'
- 'Them: Good point. Yeah. What you mean. T on Street Observing this, implementing
  it. Wouldn''t need to implement it on Street Now, my laptop on the time.'
- 'Me: I don''t know where I am on Street I won''t be here. Either.'
- 'Them: Can, you know. On last night, Friday.'
- 'Me: Or you can. Actually. No, you can, you can. You set a timer on it?'
- 'Them: Well, yeah, we''ll have like. You can say so. It will say in the back end.
  It will have like. It''ll end on Monday. And it will just count down. But if we
  do it on Friday,'
- 'Me: No, just one. I think there''s a valid date on it, though. You can. You can
  actually say this. Start displaying this on a particular date. Just looking now.
  I think you can. I think you can say when you want it to start doing it, because
  there''s a fallback. There''s a default text on there.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And I think you can say to well, if it''s before that date, just display the
  default text.'
- 'Them: That will show.'
- 'Me: So what else? It''s a year since I did this. Shade. Ok?'
- 'Them: Again if we put it in earlier in the week. Will that create more urgency
  and urge people to spend. Earlier.'
- 'Me: Well, everyone''s going to jump on on Friday anyway, aren''t they? You know,
  they. They know. They know. It''s Black Friday. It''s well advertised. Could always
  do it on Friday. You know, I actually do it on Friday morning. Put it on then.'
- 'Them: Yeah. But I also don''t want it to distract people. And then they''re like,
  oh, I''ll just. Instead of buying on Friday, I''ll buy on Monday.'
- 'Me: Or put it on on Monday.'
- 'Them: Yeah, do it on Monday. Or Friday or Monday. There''s no. Right, wrong. Just
  want people to spend.'
- 'Me: I will. I mean, I''ll be back on Sunday. I can do it Sunday night. Don''t mind
  doing it, then. It''s up to you.'
- 'Them: How would it be worded to a customer though? Will it be an hours and minutes,
  if there''s any.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Friday sale ends in. And then it''ll be. If it. If this whole day is
  in between, then it''d be a number of days. If it''s. If not, it''d be hours. If
  it''s down to last hour, it does it in minutes.'
- 'Them: Other scene in days. But if. If it worked in hours as well.'
- 'Me: I was on the last day. Does it in hours. Yeah. It looks. It''s quite effective.
  It''s quite effective to get people to. Say you let me know what you want to do
  if you want me to do it on the. On the 30th. Want to get back, which will be early
  evening. That I can do.'
- 'Them: I don''t think there''s any harm in doing it. From now we can maybe we could
  do it unpinned. And then close to the time, we can pin it.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Especially because we''re going to take out some of the other headlines
  that haven''t been performing well.'
- 'Me: The other headlines that have been performing well are non Black Friday headlines.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Which is I find that fascinating.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah, I think.'
- 'Me: You know?'
- 'Them: I think we should keep the 135 years just because that''s like, one of our,
  like, USPS. But anyway, something else, like luxury level. Product. Can come out.
  I think.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: So, yeah, let me have a. Yeah, more of a look at what you''ve written and
  then we can replace that with the Countdown and then towards the end of the week,
  we can pin it.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I mean, bear in mind, they''re 135 years will come back in again when
  we reset after Black Friday.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I said some interesting stats in.'
- 'Them: Check.'
- 'Me: That.'
- 'Them: I think, with, like, I guess, competitors and stuff. Whatever we can use
  that''s, like. Four people into our brand. You should keep it in.'
- 'Me: But they''re not clicking on it.'
- 'Them: Okay, cool. I will. Yeah, follow up about the ad copy, but, yeah, that''s
  everything for promos coming up.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: Alex, did you have any questions as well? Or you have the other thing I''ve
  mentioned? Just mainly on the main question for me was just on the structure. So
  I think we answered that at the start. So it does the limitation on creative and
  the assets change the way we structure? Do we go more search heavy vs. P max? We
  don''t have to assets to support. But I think Peter, you covered that. At the start.
  Yeah, carry on as we are.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah. We don''t have to necessarily change how we''ve done things for Black
  Friday.'
- 'Me: I''ve got. I mean, what I will do, Lauren, is I was just doing some analysis
  earlier, just on. And I know you''ve got this covered. It was just to give you another
  little bit of an inkling. I did some analysis earlier on which campaigns to actually
  push. It''s blindingly obvious. It''s the ones with the high roas. But there''s
  a little bit of stuff in there that I''ll email to you if you want to use it. Fine.
  It''s been done, so I''ll ping that over at the end of the call.'
- 'Them: Oh, thank you.'
- 'Me: And the other question that you''d both daren''t ask is, how on earth have
  I done that on my head?'
- 'Them: Now, is this going to ignore? It.'
- 'Me: It was the attack of the Cooker Hood. First thing on Street morning, about
  7:00. Just turn around. Whack right on there. Still paint on there.'
- 'Them: Did you jump up and hit it? Or what?'
- 'Me: Oh, no. I''m level with it. I''m 6 foot 4.'

- Them: Peter, how are you?
- Me: Yes. If I think y'all.
- Them: Did you have a good weekend?
- Me: See what's good. Thanks. Yes, we went to the zoo. Once we got done.
- Them: It's in the code.
- Me: For ages. It was Chester Zoo. So it's really good. We've been there quite a few times, but not in the last. 89 years. Something like that. So it was good fun. Really good fun.
- Them: Nice.
- Me: Bit different. Alex.
- Them: Hi, how are you?
- Me: That was a big build up.
- Them: Never find a bloody mute button, that's why.
- Me: It's good to see we're not on blurred background today as well.
- Them: Yeah, no, I left that in the past. It was making my head look narrower than it actually is.
- Me: Oh, right. Okay. He's never good, is it?
- Them: No, no. It doesn't do any one new favors.
- Me: Cool. It. Thing's looking good. That one.
- Them: Yeah, everything is. So we're at 66% of the target. Yeah. Or 69 if you include Bing. We're at like 60. So I've added a bit of extra budget on from like our under spends from like P5 to P7. It's only like a couple of hundred. It's like 1.7K overall, so I've added that on. So we're like 60% of pacing or budget pacing. So we've got a good amount to push this week.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: So, yeah, all good.
- Me: It's the actual spends come round nicely as well from on the dashboard. You're only about four grand over according to the weighted trajectory, which is great. I put another column on that dashboard. I mean, it's fingering the edge up really, isn't it? But I'm making it 976,000. It's going to hit now on a target at 1.1, which is pretty much what was expected, wasn't it?
- Them: As in revenue.
- Me: So it's not far off.
- Them: Well. Let's see what happens with Ross and thinks this week.
- Me: Yeah. Well, it's saying the European one. The European account looks. Looks really good.
- Them: Hopefully.
- Me: There was very little data from that last year, so there's not a lot to work on when doing a prediction. So, I mean, that's 50 grand up on where it should have been. So that's not too bad at all. It's kind of money for nothing, isn't it? And we didn't think it was going to happen. That's quite a result. And the US is doing particularly well as well. The only one I'm seeing not chucking as well is the uk.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That's about 40 grand down, something like that. But it's been made up for by the others.
- Them: Yeah, it's fine. I think it's long. As long as we're making, you know, the revenue we need to. Doesn't really matter. It comes from, but yeah. Well, if we continue how things are going now, What I can do on my side. We should hit 1.24.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Million. But we'll see. Because things tended it in the middle of the week. So yeah. But yeah, just wanted to speak about the upcoming promos briefly. I've already put in a brief for marketing, but how it works is that they kind of tell us what they're going to give us in advance. So even if I did want to request videos etc, when it comes to promos, they don't they only give us statics. And then when it's, like, big, like marketing, which is like diaries or Christmas, for example, they'll give us videos and everything else as well, which I have stressed that we need video, but we'll get into statics. So we just have to work with it. So for we have the gold stamping coming up. On. Just get the. Peter just on that, so. How much, if at all, does that change the strategy? Or the approach in Google.
- Me: Well, it doesn't really. I mean. We're on a flight path. Really? I think there's stuff I sent through this morning about the headlines was quite revealing. And. It gives us some opportunities just to nudge it a little bit. By pausing the assets that aren't doing particularly well and replacing replacing them with more promotional type headlines. I think we're at this stage now if you imagine it's just like it is like a plane coming into land and we're just making little tweaks here and there that may or may not make a difference to it. And I think the assets are quite a good one to have a look at the text assets. Because we've got shed loads of data. I mean, this time of year, we've got a huge amount of volume coming through. So it could make not a huge difference, but it could certainly make a difference as far as the offers are concerned. That could be interwoven into this. And I've been working on. A. Well, you know, when you sent over that space. Sorry, Lauren, I'm bushing your conversation here.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: I got your spreadsheet last week, just with the ones with the tick box on, the G sheet with the tick box on. And it's got all the assets on text assets for when we revert back. Next week, next Tuesday.
- Them: Yeah. That is a work in progress. But it needs to. Yeah.
- Me: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine. No, it's more about the asset. So I looked at the way you've done the text assets, and one of the real pains for both of us. Is to do this. Quickly. It takes a huge amount of time to redo them. I've written something that will do it. We'll take those assets as they are in that format. It needs to be in that format. And it replaced the ones that are already there. So we've got the campaign names and the asset group names. In that spreadsheet. And then all the headlines and description lines. So if it's in that format, this system will go through and read those and just go and replace it. What's already there.
- Them: So it will go into Google Ads and replace things.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: How bizarre. Right.
- Them: That that could help issue. I think we just need to check over everything to make sure it does it properly.
- Me: Definitely. So what I've built into it is I built a check into it, and I've also built in a rollback, so it takes a copy before it does it, and then I can go and have a look at it. And I think the best way is. Drop down to Google Ads editor. Then run it. And then drop it down to Google Ads Editors again, and then it will show you in green exactly what's been changed. So we'll know implicitly.
- Them: So it's like a script.
- Me: What's changed between those two moments?
- Them: Okay?
- Me: But it should be pretty quick to do it. And the strategy is basically do one. On the Tuesday, and if that works okay and happy with it, then just blast through and do all the others. It's just things like all the European ones, they're just an absolute nightmare to do, and it will just mean that we're a bit more thorough. Or I'm a bit more thorough with doing it, and I can do it on all of them if you want me to do the whole lot, but I can do. Because it's the same process for all of them.
- Them: Yeah. I don't have an issue with, like, making things more efficient. I think that's always a good thing to do, as long as it's, like, efficient and accurate. Yeah. So let's try it, and then if it works and it's fine, then, yeah, we can implement it across everything. Maybe.
- Me: I can sit down with diary for 8 o'clock next Tuesday and run it through. And if there's anything you want to change, you can go Street into those G sheets and change the headlines and descriptions if you wanted to.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. With the G sheet as it is right now, I just want to change everything to sentence case, because there's still things in there that are, like, all capitals, and we just want to make everything consistent so before it goes back in.
- Me: Yeah. Great.
- Them: As we've had, like, Black Friday, I think it's, you know, sentence case, so, yeah. I'll be doing that this week. And just make sure you've got all the efforts and everything for us to put everything back in. In terms of the visual assets. Will it. Will the script that you're creating be able to do that as well with. Okay, we have to do that. That's fine.
- Me: The images are always going to be a problem because. It's getting into it via the API is quite difficult and. There's no way of identifying the system, identifying what images are going to go where. It is a very much a visual thing.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: It's certainly something that can be looked at going forward. If the image just off the top of my head, if the image was called the campaign name and the asset group, then potentially it could drop it in there. Because it would know exactly where to do it. So, for instance, on the asset group spreadsheet, if there were other columns next to it that actually had the name of the asset, In it. The image asset, then it could possibly pull those in and do it. But I don't know about that. And I think we're in Black Friday week now. I think it would be dangerous for us to do any experimentation as far as the images, because it's already been seen to be a little bit not flaky, but it's a bit more complicated. The text is something we can change very quick, very well, relatively easily, whereas the images. There's a bit more to it because there's folders and things that it needs to sit in. Does it need to be in the asset library? Can we access it? And all those bits and pieces. So eventually, yes, probably.
- Them: Okay? Cool. That's fine. While in the court, I'll go through permissions of a min. If there's, like any other, I guess, operational bits, we can go through that tomorrow. Don't want to have a catch up. But, yeah, I started responding to your asset reviews. Thank you. I'll just respond properly after.
- Me: Sure. Yeah, yeah, no problem.
- Them: But, yeah, read through it and everything, so, yeah. Thank.
- Me: So if you want me to. If you want me to whiz through those and make some changes, then I can certainly do that.
- Them: You. Okay, let me respond to you, and then we can go from there.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: So, yeah, we've got gold stamping. On the 6th and 7th of December when we had a gold stamping a horror in October. I pinned RSAs and we had site links live. But I think we can take that a step further this time and have some promotional extensions as well. And permission on Merchant Center. And then I've also requested image extensions.
- Me: So what date was that again?
- Them: So. 6 and 7th of December.
- Me: Ok, ok.
- Them: I just need to see if it's. If there's a skew list for it. Alex, do you know if there's going to be. If it's going to be free gold stamping on everything. Well, it's only. Yeah. There's only set skus that can be gold stamped anyway. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago. So I'll just double check that. Yes, it'll be the same list as from the gold stamping promo we run recently. Cool. That's fine. So, yeah, all the gold stamping and then we have 20 off notebooks on the 8th to the 14th of December, so again, we'll have pinned our C headline for notebooks. Slightly expirational extensions. Permissions on Merchant Center. And. Yeah, image extensions. We don't know. We'll have a visual on. I'll just check. I'll put it in.
- Me: So we're going to do that.
- Them: The. List.
- Me: Am I going to learn my lesson from last time with the merchant center to actually drop these in as IDS into merchant center for the promotions rather than trying to do it in one big spreadsheet? Really don't want to go through that pain again.
- Them: I mean. I mean. I'll. I'd love to have a go at it and see how it works. I try and practice it.
- Me: If you want to lose a few hours of your life, then that's fine.
- Them: And try and do the spreadsheet.
- Me: The idea one is, ok, you can literally just cut and paste them in. It's just when you're going to do. If you were to do it as a promotional spreadsheet,
- Them: Here.
- Me: Complete. That's when it starts to get wobbly. That's where it screwed up last time.
- Them: Don't you have to just create the promotion manually on Merchant center and then put that promotional ID along with the item ID and then put the. Spreadsheet into the supplemental feeds.
- Me: No. If you're going to create it manually on Merchant center, you create it manually and then it says, how do you want to identify which products they are? You just cut and paste the product IDS in there as a list.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: The way it was done. The way it was done the first time was to do it as one big spreadsheet which sets up the actual promotion itself, along with all the ids. And that's where it just got ridiculous. That's where you got complicated. And that's when I backed out of eventually.
- Them: So it. 's just. Okay, so it's just better to do it manually, but use a list of. Okay, that's fine.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: I can have a go at that and see how that goes. So. Yeah, that's a notebooks. And then everything else. During this time will be back to Christmas. And then we've got the winter sale. So again, it will just be like a Black Friday kind of graphic. Across p max. We can pause. I'll say we can pause a Christmas gifting campaigns then, because they will no longer be relevant. But we'll. We can still put in the Winter cell graphic into the regular hero fragits. Emma's campaign that adds like all the different product groups. We can reactivate gifting in there because that's gifting that all, like, just be like a different gifting moments in the year and different promotions.
- Me: It's a good idea to leave.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We just kind of like. What's the word I'm looking for? Falling back a little bit. Yeah.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And we'll have. Yeah. Site links. Promotions. Promotions. Merch and center again. Image extensions. And we can also pull some of the gifting campaigns that we've had live in a year. And rest of world by that point as well. Because Christmas will be over. A note on gifting. That we will all need to stop on the last delivery dates. Yeah, so I've got delivery dates as well. Yeah, so we'll stop communicating that just because otherwise people are end up buying stuff on the 22nd. It's not going to get them. So we just need to make sure that all gifted related ad support on their respective countries last dates. And we can roll back to any sort of autumn, winter BAU messaging. For the four five days before we go into the Christmas sale. Oh, that's fine.
- Me: It's nice that most of the stuff is in the Christmas gift. Campaigns, isn't it? They can just be. Literally just pause. We could even set a rule to pause. Them.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. I'm just looking for the delivery day email so I can just screenshot and send.
- Me: Is there a very specific last delivery date? Last order date.
- Them: Yeah, there's, like, different order dates for the different market.
- Me: Ok? So can we do countdown timers on those?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, we can. And speaking of that, wanted to do countdown timers for Black Friday as well. I just haven't seen over like a. Draft of it for Alex to see and see. It's okay. When do we want to do that? By well. If it ends. If it's ending on Monday, then that'll do it. From tomorrow and be that. Like. Would that be so? Indeed. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Yeah. If we do it from tomorrow, then we can say Black Friday ends in seven days. Or sell ends in seven. Well, yeah, it wouldn't be Black Friday anymore, but yeah, we can do so. And in seven days. Or I need to see what. What goes into the character count. 30 characters.
- Me: Could I suggest?
- Them: Is it dynamic? Sorry, Peter. Yeah, so it changes based on the date of the week. It will change to six days and then five days, etc.
- Me: Could I suggest you start the countdown on the Street Because to say that the Black Friday sale ends and we've not even got to Black Friday yet. People know where Black Friday is. We've started it on the Street to say from clicking over from midnight on Street say Black Friday sales sends ends on Monday at midnight then at least that's what you're saying to people is there is still a Black Friday sale on, even though it isn't black. Friday. I know everybody does it, but at least it would add some urgency. Then from the Street through to the Monday.
- Them: Good point. Yeah. What you mean. T on Street Observing this, implementing it. Wouldn't need to implement it on Street Now, my laptop on the time.
- Me: I don't know where I am on Street I won't be here. Either.
- Them: Can, you know. On last night, Friday.
- Me: Or you can. Actually. No, you can, you can. You set a timer on it?
- Them: Well, yeah, we'll have like. You can say so. It will say in the back end. It will have like. It'll end on Monday. And it will just count down. But if we do it on Friday,
- Me: No, just one. I think there's a valid date on it, though. You can. You can actually say this. Start displaying this on a particular date. Just looking now. I think you can. I think you can say when you want it to start doing it, because there's a fallback. There's a default text on there.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And I think you can say to well, if it's before that date, just display the default text.
- Them: That will show.
- Me: So what else? It's a year since I did this. Shade. Ok?
- Them: Again if we put it in earlier in the week. Will that create more urgency and urge people to spend. Earlier.
- Me: Well, everyone's going to jump on on Friday anyway, aren't they? You know, they. They know. They know. It's Black Friday. It's well advertised. Could always do it on Friday. You know, I actually do it on Friday morning. Put it on then.
- Them: Yeah. But I also don't want it to distract people. And then they're like, oh, I'll just. Instead of buying on Friday, I'll buy on Monday.
- Me: Or put it on on Monday.
- Them: Yeah, do it on Monday. Or Friday or Monday. There's no. Right, wrong. Just want people to spend.
- Me: I will. I mean, I'll be back on Sunday. I can do it Sunday night. Don't mind doing it, then. It's up to you.
- Them: How would it be worded to a customer though? Will it be an hours and minutes, if there's any.
- Me: Yeah. Friday sale ends in. And then it'll be. If it. If this whole day is in between, then it'd be a number of days. If it's. If not, it'd be hours. If it's down to last hour, it does it in minutes.
- Them: Other scene in days. But if. If it worked in hours as well.
- Me: I was on the last day. Does it in hours. Yeah. It looks. It's quite effective. It's quite effective to get people to. Say you let me know what you want to do if you want me to do it on the. On the 30th. Want to get back, which will be early evening. That I can do.
- Them: I don't think there's any harm in doing it. From now we can maybe we could do it unpinned. And then close to the time, we can pin it.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: Yeah. Especially because we're going to take out some of the other headlines that haven't been performing well.
- Me: The other headlines that have been performing well are non Black Friday headlines.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Which is I find that fascinating.
- Them: Y. Eah, I think.
- Me: You know?
- Them: I think we should keep the 135 years just because that's like, one of our, like, USPS. But anyway, something else, like luxury level. Product. Can come out. I think.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: So, yeah, let me have a. Yeah, more of a look at what you've written and then we can replace that with the Countdown and then towards the end of the week, we can pin it.
- Me: Yeah. I mean, bear in mind, they're 135 years will come back in again when we reset after Black Friday.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I said some interesting stats in.
- Them: Check.
- Me: That.
- Them: I think, with, like, I guess, competitors and stuff. Whatever we can use that's, like. Four people into our brand. You should keep it in.
- Me: But they're not clicking on it.
- Them: Okay, cool. I will. Yeah, follow up about the ad copy, but, yeah, that's everything for promos coming up.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: Alex, did you have any questions as well? Or you have the other thing I've mentioned? Just mainly on the main question for me was just on the structure. So I think we answered that at the start. So it does the limitation on creative and the assets change the way we structure? Do we go more search heavy vs. P max? We don't have to assets to support. But I think Peter, you covered that. At the start. Yeah, carry on as we are.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Yeah. We don't have to necessarily change how we've done things for Black Friday.
- Me: I've got. I mean, what I will do, Lauren, is I was just doing some analysis earlier, just on. And I know you've got this covered. It was just to give you another little bit of an inkling. I did some analysis earlier on which campaigns to actually push. It's blindingly obvious. It's the ones with the high roas. But there's a little bit of stuff in there that I'll email to you if you want to use it. Fine. It's been done, so I'll ping that over at the end of the call.
- Them: Oh, thank you.
- Me: And the other question that you'd both daren't ask is, how on earth have I done that on my head?
- Them: Now, is this going to ignore? It.
- Me: It was the attack of the Cooker Hood. First thing on Street morning, about 7:00. Just turn around. Whack right on there. Still paint on there.
- Them: Did you jump up and hit it? Or what?
- Me: Oh, no. I'm level with it. I'm 6 foot 4.

## Strategic Decisions

- Maintain current Google Ads campaign structure despite limited creative assets
- Develop script to efficiently update text assets across campaigns
- Plan promotional strategies for upcoming events (Gold Stamping, Notebooks Sale, Winter Sale)

## Key Learnings

- Non-Black Friday headlines are currently performing better than Black Friday-specific ads
- Merchant Center promotions are best managed manually rather than through complex spreadsheets
- Countdown timers can potentially create urgency in advertising

Them: Peter, how are you?
Me: Yes. If I think y'all.
Them: Did you have a good weekend?
Me: See what's good. Thanks. Yes, we went to the zoo. Once we got done.
Them: It's in the code.
Me: For ages. It was Chester Zoo. So it's really good. We've been there quite a few times, but not in the last. 89 years. Something like that. So it was good fun. Really good fun.
Them: Nice.
Me: Bit different. Alex.
Them: Hi, how are you?
Me: That was a big build up.
Them: Never find a bloody mute button, that's why.
Me: It's good to see we're not on blurred background today as well.
Them: Yeah, no, I left that in the past. It was making my head look narrower than it actually is.
Me: Oh, right. Okay. He's never good, is it?
Them: No, no. It doesn't do any one new favors.
Me: Cool. It. Thing's looking good. That one.
Them: Yeah, everything is. So we're at 66% of the target. Yeah. Or 69 if you include Bing. We're at like 60. So I've added a bit of extra budget on from like our under spends from like P5 to P7. It's only like a couple of hundred. It's like 1.7K overall, so I've added that on. So we're like 60% of pacing or budget pacing. So we've got a good amount to push this week.
Me: Cool.
Them: So, yeah, all good.
Me: It's the actual spends come round nicely as well from on the dashboard. You're only about four grand over according to the weighted trajectory, which is great. I put another column on that dashboard. I mean, it's fingering the edge up really, isn't it? But I'm making it 976,000. It's going to hit now on a target at 1.1, which is pretty much what was expected, wasn't it?
Them: As in revenue.
Me: So it's not far off.
Them: Well. Let's see what happens with Ross and thinks this week.
Me: Yeah. Well, it's saying the European one. The European account looks. Looks really good.
Them: Hopefully.
Me: There was very little data from that last year, so there's not a lot to work on when doing a prediction. So, I mean, that's 50 grand up on where it should have been. So that's not too bad at all. It's kind of money for nothing, isn't it? And we didn't think it was going to happen. That's quite a result. And the US is doing particularly well as well. The only one I'm seeing not chucking as well is the uk.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That's about 40 grand down, something like that. But it's been made up for by the others.
Them: Yeah, it's fine. I think it's long. As long as we're making, you know, the revenue we need to. Doesn't really matter. It comes from, but yeah. Well, if we continue how things are going now, What I can do on my side. We should hit 1.24.
Me: Okay?
Them: Million. But we'll see. Because things tended it in the middle of the week. So yeah. But yeah, just wanted to speak about the upcoming promos briefly. I've already put in a brief for marketing, but how it works is that they kind of tell us what they're going to give us in advance. So even if I did want to request videos etc, when it comes to promos, they don't they only give us statics. And then when it's, like, big, like marketing, which is like diaries or Christmas, for example, they'll give us videos and everything else as well, which I have stressed that we need video, but we'll get into statics. So we just have to work with it. So for we have the gold stamping coming up. On. Just get the. Peter just on that, so. How much, if at all, does that change the strategy? Or the approach in Google.
Me: Well, it doesn't really. I mean. We're on a flight path. Really? I think there's stuff I sent through this morning about the headlines was quite revealing. And. It gives us some opportunities just to nudge it a little bit. By pausing the assets that aren't doing particularly well and replacing replacing them with more promotional type headlines. I think we're at this stage now if you imagine it's just like it is like a plane coming into land and we're just making little tweaks here and there that may or may not make a difference to it.

Don't want to have a catch up. But, yeah, I started responding to your asset reviews. Thank you. I'll just respond properly after.

Them: You. Okay, let me respond to you, and then we can go from there.
Me: Ok?
Them: So, yeah, we've got gold stamping. On the 6th and 7th of December when we had a gold stamping a horror in October. I pinned RSAs and we had site links live. But I think we can take that a step further this time and have some promotional extensions as well. And permission on Merchant Center. And then I've also requested image extensions.
Me: So what date was that again?
Them: So. 6 and 7th of December.
Me: Ok, ok.
Them: I just need to see if it's. If there's a skew list for it. Alex, do you know if there's going to be. If it's going to be free gold stamping on everything. Well, it's only. Yeah. There's only set skus that can be gold stamped anyway. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago. So I'll just double check that. Yes, it'll be the same list as from the gold stamping promo we run recently. Cool. That's fine. So, yeah, all the gold stamping and then we have 20 off notebooks on the 8th to the 14th of December, so again, we'll have pinned our C headline for notebooks. Slightly expirational extensions. Permissions on Merchant Center. And. Yeah, image extensions. We don't know. We'll have a visual on. I'll just check. I'll put it in.
Me: So we're going to do that.
Them: The. List.
Me: Am I going to learn my lesson from last time with the merchant center to actually drop these in as IDS into merchant center for the promotions rather than trying to do it in one big spreadsheet? Really don't want to go through that pain again.
Them: I mean. I mean. I'll. I'd love to have a go at it and see how it works. I try and practice it.
Me: If you want to lose a few hours of your life, then that's fine.
Them: And try and do the spreadsheet.
Me: The idea one is, ok, you can literally just cut and paste them in. It's just when you're going to do. If you were to do it as a promotional spreadsheet,
Them: Here.
Me: Complete. That's when it starts to get wobbly. That's where it screwed up last time.
Them: Don't you have to just create the promotion manually on Merchant center and then put that promotional ID along with the item ID and then put the. Spreadsheet into the supplemental feeds.
Me: No. If you're going to create it manually on Merchant center, you create it manually and then it says, how do you want to identify which products they are? You just cut and paste the product IDS in there as a list.
Them: Okay?
Me: The way it was done. The way it was done the first time was to do it as one big spreadsheet which sets up the actual promotion itself, along with all the ids. And that's where it just got ridiculous. That's where you got complicated. And that's when I backed out of eventually.
Them: So it. 's just. Okay, so it's just better to do it manually, but use a list of. Okay, that's fine.
Me: Yes.
Them: I can have a go at that and see how that goes. So. Yeah, that's a notebooks. And then everything else. During this time will be back to Christmas. And then we've got the winter sale. So again, it will just be like a Black Friday kind of graphic. Across p max. We can pause. I'll say we can pause a Christmas gifting campaigns then, because they will no longer be relevant. But we'll. We can still put in the Winter cell graphic into the regular hero fragits. Emma's campaign that adds like all the different product groups. We can reactivate gifting in there because that's gifting that all, like, just be like a different gifting moments in the year and different promotions.
Me: It's a good idea to leave.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We just kind of like. What's the word I'm looking for? Falling back a little bit. Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And we'll have. Yeah. Site links. Promotions. Promotions. Merch and center again. Image extensions. And we can also pull some of the gifting campaigns that we've had live in a year. And rest of world by that point as well. Because Christmas will be over. A note on gifting. That we will all need to stop on the last delivery dates. Yeah, so I've got delivery dates as well. Yeah, so we'll stop communicating that just because otherwise people are end up buying stuff on the 22nd. It's not going to get them. So we just need to make sure that all gifted related ad support on their respective countries last dates. And we can roll back to any sort of autumn, winter BAU messaging. For the four five days before we go into the Christmas sale. Oh, that's fine.
Me: It's nice that most of the stuff is in the Christmas gift. Campaigns, isn't it? They can just be. Literally just pause. We could even set a rule to pause. Them.
Them: Yeah, yeah. I'm just looking for the delivery day email so I can just screenshot and send.
Me: Is there a very specific last delivery date? Last order date.
Them: Yeah, there's, like, different order dates for the different market.
Me: Ok? So can we do countdown timers on those?
Them: Yeah. Yeah, we can. And speaking of that, wanted to do countdown timers for Black Friday as well. I just haven't seen over like a. Draft of it for Alex to see and see. It's okay. When do we want to do that? By well. If it ends. If it's ending on Monday, then that'll do it. From tomorrow and be that. Like. Would that be so? Indeed. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Yeah. If we do it from tomorrow, then we can say Black Friday ends in seven days. Or sell ends in seven. Well, yeah, it wouldn't be Black Friday anymore, but yeah, we can do so. And in seven days. Or I need to see what. What goes into the character count. 30 characters.
Me: Could I suggest?
Them: Is it dynamic? Sorry, Peter. Yeah, so it changes based on the date of the week. It will change to six days and then five days, etc.
Me: Could I suggest you start the countdown on the Street Because to say that the Black Friday sale ends and we've not even got to Black Friday yet. People know where Black Friday is. We've started it on the Street to say from clicking over from midnight on Street say Black Friday sales sends ends on Monday at midnight then at least that's what you're saying to people is there is still a Black Friday sale on, even though it isn't black. Friday. I know everybody does it, but at least it would add some urgency. Then from the Street through to the Monday.
Them: Good point. Yeah. What you mean. T on Street Observing this, implementing it. Wouldn't need to implement it on Street Now, my laptop on the time.
Me: I don't know where I am on Street I won't be here. Either.
Them: Can, you know. On last night, Friday.
Me: Or you can. Actually. No, you can, you can. You set a timer on it?
Them: Well, yeah, we'll have like. You can say so. It will say in the back end. It will have like. It'll end on Monday. And it will just count down. But if we do it on Friday,
Me: No, just one. I think there's a valid date on it, though. You can. You can actually say this. Start displaying this on a particular date. Just looking now. I think you can. I think you can say when you want it to start doing it, because there's a fallback. There's a default text on there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And I think you can say to well, if it's before that date, just display the default text.
Them: That will show.
Me: So what else? It's a year since I did this. Shade. Ok?
Them: Again if we put it in earlier in the week. Will that create more urgency and urge people to spend. Earlier.
Me: Well, everyone's going to jump on on Friday anyway, aren't they? You know, they. They know. They know. It's Black Friday. It's well advertised. Could always do it on Friday. You know, I actually do it on Friday morning. Put it on then.
Them: Yeah. But I also don't want it to distract people. And then they're like, oh, I'll just. Instead of buying on Friday, I'll buy on Monday.
Me: Or put it on on Monday.
Them: Yeah, do it on Monday. Or Friday or Monday. There's no. Right, wrong. Just want people to spend.
Me: I will. I mean, I'll be back on Sunday. I can do it Sunday night. Don't mind doing it, then. It's up to you.
Them: How would it be worded to a customer though? Will it be an hours and minutes, if there's any.
Me: Yeah. Friday sale ends in. And then it'll be. If it. If this whole day is in between, then it'd be a number of days. If it's. If not, it'd be hours. If it's down to last hour, it does it in minutes.
Them: Other scene in days. But if. If it worked in hours as well.
Me: I was on the last day. Does it in hours. Yeah. It looks. It's quite effective. It's quite effective to get people to. Say you let me know what you want to do if you want me to do it on the. On the 30th. Want to get back, which will be early evening. That I can do.
Them: I don't think there's any harm in doing it. From now we can maybe we could do it unpinned. And then close to the time, we can pin it.
Me: Ok?
Them: Yeah. Especially because we're going to take out some of the other headlines that haven't been performing well.
Me: The other headlines that have been performing well are non Black Friday headlines.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Which is I find that fascinating.
Them: Y. Eah, I think.
Me: You know?
Them: I think we should keep the 135 years just because that's like, one of our, like, USPS. But anyway, something else, like luxury level. Product. Can come out. I think.
Me: Ok?
Them: So, yeah, let me have a. Yeah, more of a look at what you've written and then we can replace that with the Countdown and then towards the end of the week, we can pin it.
Me: Yeah. I mean, bear in mind, they're 135 years will come back in again when we reset after Black Friday.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I said some interesting stats in.
Them: Check.
Me: That.
Them: I think, with, like, I guess, competitors and stuff. Whatever we can use that's, like. Four people into our brand. You should keep it in.
Me: But they're not clicking on it.
Them: Okay, cool. I will. Yeah, follow up about the ad copy, but, yeah, that's everything for promos coming up.
Me: Ok?
Them: Alex, did you have any questions as well? Or you have the other thing I've mentioned? Just mainly on the main question for me was just on the structure. So I think we answered that at the start. So it does the limitation on creative and the assets change the way we structure? Do we go more search heavy vs. P max? We don't have to assets to support. But I think Peter, you covered that. At the start. Yeah, carry on as we are.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah. We don't have to necessarily change how we've done things for Black Friday.
Me: I've got. I mean, what I will do, Lauren, is I was just doing some analysis earlier, just on. And I know you've got this covered. It was just to give you another little bit of an inkling. I did some analysis earlier on which campaigns to actually push. It's blindingly obvious. It's the ones with the high roas. But there's a little bit of stuff in there that I'll email to you if you want to use it. Fine. It's been done, so I'll ping that over at the end of the call.
Them: Oh, thank you.
Me: And the other question that you'd both daren't ask is, how on earth have I done that on my head?
Them: Now, is this going to ignore? It.
Me: It was the attack of the Cooker Hood. First thing on Street morning, about 7:00. Just turn around. Whack right on there. Still paint on there.
Them: Did you jump up and hit it? Or what?
Me: Oh, no. I'm level with it. I'm 6 foot 4.
