- -- Full Transcript ---
- 'Me: Lost all the dates. All right. Mate.'
- 'Them: Mute again.'
- 'Me: Hello.'
- 'Them: Wish it would just. I wish it would just not have it as mute at the start.'
- 'Me: Does it default to mute at the beginning?'
- 'Them: By. Yeah, I thought it was. Normally when there was more than one other person
  in the room, it would default to mute.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But nevertheless.'
- 'Me: I need it to make me a cup of tea when I start the meeting.'
- 'Them: How are you? Yeah. Finished the one that I had on the train this morning,
  and then I try and leave it until 11 to go get another one. Tell you.'
- 'Me: It''s been a busy weekend.'
- 'Them: Wow. What a week. What a week.'
- 'Me: I wasn''t expecting that, mate.'
- 'Them: What a week. No. Well, I just said no, like I wasn''t. Honestly, it''s my
  choice, but. Yeah. So I had to make a decision.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Had to make it, take a decision and. I mean, in terms of. The sort of fit
  for this role that we need. You know, I, I, you know, we do desperately need someone
  who can kind of stand and learn two feet and confidently manage it. You know, I
  think you''ve had to do a lot more of the heavy lifting. Which is long term, not.
  Not what we want. And you know what? To be honest, I mean, I didn''t necessarily
  share it all in this group that we had because I didn''t want it to come across
  like I was sort of beating the stick in front of someone else.'
- 'Me: I would keep your mad down as well. Mate.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but the amount of stuff that I just think. That. Honestly, I''ve got
  three pages of. Things that just. And this is, like, fundamental hygiene stuff that
  I think, like, from when she joined. You''d thinking, right? First kind of couple
  of weeks, I''m going to get under the bonnet of everything and make sure that everything
  that''s possibly going to be shown to a customer is accurate, you know? It''s where
  it ought to be. There didn''t seem to be. A kind of much organization from her end
  on, like things like Christmas launch. Or like it wasn''t clear from what she was
  telling me that there was a plan. You know, this is the work we got to do. This
  is how we''re splitting it. And even Black Friday as well. You know, I think we
  have the wrong promo dates. In because she assumed that because the financial period
  ends on Sunday, That the primary must end on Sunday as well.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But completely missing Cyber Monday.'
- 'Me: Cyber Monday.'
- 'Them: But there''s never been any communication. So I checked. The Merchant sent
  the promos that you set up. Because I thought, well, if Lauren didn''t know what
  the dates were, Did you know what the dates were? And they were fine. So I''m like,
  well, how have we got a site linked promo? Showing to customers at the promo ends
  on the 30th. And it''s unfortunately, it''s kind of like series of mistake after
  mistake, a mistake like that. That we were. We''re spending the most important time
  of the year. Trying to fix those basic things rather than figuring out how do we
  kind of, you know, over perform.'
- 'Me: Squeeze the nuts out of it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And I think you know the kind of. Especially with our team as well.
  It''s like, and I think, to be honest, I mean, some of the feedback I''ve had from
  other people since yesterday is that they felt she struggled in the meetings in
  terms of, like, our team meetings on a Monday to try and explain how Pace Search
  was performing and, like, kind of almost any question from Seb. Just ended up with
  kind of like a deer in headlights. Look. So I think she relied a lot on you. But
  if. The thing was, you know, if it was that. If the goal was to have someone internally,
  then they can''t rely on you like it should be. You''re there as an expert, as a
  bit of guidance, you know, even in a kind of a mentor role. But ultimately, she
  needs to kind of be confident and know enough that she''s. That she''s driving it.
  So.'
- 'Me: It''s funny from my perspective. It''s why I don''t work for anyone. I''ll
  be honest with you. It''s why I don''t work for anyone, because I just get on with
  it. I don''t do committees. I don''t do massive meetings. If I''m being trusted
  to look after an account, then I''m being trusted. I''ll just do it. I don''t need
  to have a couple of meetings to say, is that all right? It''s like the Black Friday
  countdown timer asking you whether it''s all right. Well, yeah. Okay. There''s a
  process of. This is what I''m doing. You look at it and go, oh, by the way, don''t
  put sale. Put this right. Okay. It''s not. Is it okay if I do? This. I''ve just
  sent it to this person, this person, this person, this person. And then waiting
  a week for it to come back, because that will happen.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: We''re on the leading edge of this right now.'
- 'Them: No, to be honest, that''s. That''s a good point. I mean. Because when I''m
  being asked, is it okay to do it? Well, I don''t know. Is that okay? I mean, if
  you said to me, this is what we''re doing, Can you just make sure you''re happy
  with the words?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, cool. I wouldn''t even think to question whether it''s a good or bad
  idea. I just trust it''s a good idea and it''s going to make more money. But when
  it''s like, You know, because I don''t. Yeah, Like, I struggled a bit with that
  conversation. It was like. She seemed kind of very unsure. It even went to start
  it. And it''s like. But I need you to kind of have. You need to back your own decisions,
  you know, just make a decision. Otherwise, I''m kind of sat there thinking, well,
  I don''t even know if we should be doing it because we don''t even know when we
  should be starting it or. Do we even bother? So. Yeah, I mean, that and that kind
  of indecision. Sort of means, then I spend more time. Just checking. And then the
  problem is, then you start checking, then you start finding bits and you''re thinking,
  well, you know. And I know it''s not. It''s not necessarily a fair way of looking
  at the world, but I think, right, you''re here for 40 hours a week. The only thing
  I need you to do is just. You''ve got Peter support, but just keep on top of these
  accounts, make sure that everything''s. Optimized. That''s it. I don''t need to
  do anything else. I don''t want you to try and help on paid social or help anyone
  else or do anything other than just focus solely. Just do the best you can in that
  area. But. Yeah, so it''s. Yeah, it''s a horrible decision to have to make, but.
  I think it was the right one. I don''t think she was likely to kind of come on leaps
  and bounds. I think she was feeling the pressure. Quite a lot.'
- 'Me: The problem is agency side. You''re getting fed bits and pieces when.'
- 'Them: And then I think, Yeah.'
- 'Me: You''re actually responsible for everything you need to know everything.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And she did mention that, you know, into HR yesterday, that she was
  used to having someone like an exec to kind of do the doing. But. But then we made
  that so clear when we put this role out. Yeah. And we kind of, you know, we made
  it so clear when we put this role out that, like, you have to be the internal page
  charts expert. Like, you have to be willing to do the doing, but also be involved
  in the thinking. So, yeah, we really kind of handed that. And. Yeah. Yeah. So difficult
  choice, but then, you know. The easy thing would be to try and look, overlook everything,
  and then just spend the rest of my life trying to convince myself and Seb that it''s
  all fine. Or, you know, constantly covering. And I don''t think it would have worked
  out. I wouldn''t have had confidence at the end of January, if you were to go and
  she was to be managing all this all by herself. I wouldn''t have the confidence
  that things would be. Getting handled. Because even though the stuff you sent over
  yesterday. It would probably take two weeks for me to get that. From Lauren, respectfully.
  Whereas that. It''s like, you know what? It''s like when you got kind of like, you
  know, Paolo''s asking seven and then seven then asking me, and it''s because he
  needs it for a bought meeting on Thursday. And it''s like, well, I need answers.
  Like, they don''t have to. Be kind of 100% correct, but it''s just got to be kind
  of close enough to.'
- 'Me: Apologies to that. That was quite embarrassing, that, and I''m glad you checked
  it because. And it was obvious at the end, there''s either account level starts
  for certain things and there''s campaign level stats because like US UK business
  with the conversion action, sometimes it has to drop back to campaign.'
- 'Them: Y. Es.'
- 'Me: And for some reason, it did.'
- 'Them: But that second set of numbers that, because I looked at the first set at
  185 or 1, 95 for the UK, I thought that looks like almost looks too far away from
  the double counted number. But the two A8, actually, even though I didn''t know
  of that by that point, I didn''t know which one to go for, but the 288 felt like.
  Just felt a bit closer to where it was. And that''s all we need to kind of get to
  is go right.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: You know, brand revenue in the UK hasn''t actually cut in half. That''s not
  true, because when you strip out the double counting, it''s actually a lot closer.
  Or actually it''s slightly under. We''re slightly up, sorry, this year. And it just
  tells a completely different story.'
- 'Me: There''s a different level of positivity in those numbers. The fact the brand
  non brand has been increased.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, it''s. It''s. And you are likely to be getting more new customers.
  Is that. Is that being reflected in the numbers or not?'
- 'Them: Yeah, we saw that for last week, so I think I''ll just pull it up quick.
  So we had. Bear with me. Your second weekly reports. So for last week. I will click
  on the right report. Here we go. So. Yeah, so we had just under 1, 500 people shop
  online last week and. The. Oh, the first. Hang on. 37% of people last week were
  new.'
- 'Me: Wow. Wow, wow, wow.'
- 'Them: So that is that.'
- 'Me: It''s such a strong brand. That''s pretty impressive, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Is. Yeah. So I''ll show you. Let me just see if you can. I can share this
  with you. I''m not sure if it''s going to.'
- 'Me: Who don''t want to pay for it.'
- 'Them: No, no, that''s it. So, yeah, we had just under 2,600 customers shopped last
  week, so that''s up 76% on the previous week. 961 of them, so 37% of them were brand
  new.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: Which is up 2%. On last year.'
- 'Me: Very good.'
- 'Them: So that''s. Yeah, so that''s pretty good. So the number, and the big one
  is, you know, the number of people that have shopped in the last 12 months, and
  that''s only 4% below last year now. I got one point that was kind of like 10% below.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: And that''s. That''s just website numbers. And then what''s been more encouraging?
  Which I''m keen for us to take as much credit as possible is the numbers for the
  first two days of this week.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: Is that what you sent through this morning?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. So for Monday, we were 9% up on forecast, plus 10 to last year
  and then plus 14, like for like. And then yesterday, which is the one I sent this
  morning, we were plus 19 first, our forecast, plus 21 to the year and plus 23 like
  for like, so.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: That''s strong. That''s really strong. That''s really kind of clawing back.
  The problem is we don''t get consistent performance like that. So I''ll be really
  intrigued to see. How the rest of this week goes.'
- 'Me: Well, we''re black Friday week, aren''t we? So. The bloody dashboard''s gone
  down this morning. I''ll get. I''ll get the numbers updated. That dashboard, which
  I''ve created. In fact, let me. Let me kick it off now. We should have that at the
  end because it''s giving us a kind of prediction. It''s all fingering the air job,
  this.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: My concern is we spent too much money too soon. You know that? Should we should
  have just. Held on until this week before going full on with it. But depending on
  what time of day I run the prediction, depends on whether we''re going to smash
  the target. Well, just beat the target or be about 200 grand below it. So which
  will be, you know, it''s. When you looked at those figures for the revenue figures
  against last year, you could see it peaking now.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, it was it last year, it was fairly flat, and then it started to go
  up. It''s going to be fascinating to see what happens. I can''t wait until and I''m
  hoping still around at this time, it''s I can''t wait till May so that when we''re
  doing year on year comparisons. We can actually do year on year comparisons, Right.
  Pissing about with the conversion action on it that will make things so much easier.
  So.'
- 'Them: Yes. Yeah. Then it really is, like, for, like. Because it''s just a nightmare
  to try and look at at a minute.'
- 'Me: Yes. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.'
- 'Them: So I had a couple of bits just to cover this morning. Probably mainly just
  in kind of rebalancing. Kind of between us, who''s doing what. I. I expect it''ll
  probably go back to what we did over the summer. As in, you know, I. I can communicate
  all of the budgets per month.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: And then happy for you to kind of chop those up performance wise how you
  want to between uk, us, Roan, eu, but I can give you the top line number.'
- 'Me: There''s going to be more in Europe. I think the latest budget pushed a bit
  more towards Europe because it''s doing well and rest of the world because there
  was nothing there last year. It''s low hanging fruit that, you know, it''s a lot
  of brown in.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: One thing.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So I''ll definitely. I''ll keep sending those over to you, and then
  I won''t. Get involved in kind of. Who, What. Where''s the account necessarily?
  Because I think that''ll end up being a pain in the ass for you. I''m going in there
  adjusting stuff, and then you''re going in there and going, I didn''t bloody do
  that.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: So I''ll leave that to you. The only things I''ll do is.'
- 'Me: I''ll know. I will.'
- 'Them: Just be kind of checking over from a copy and a creative point of view that
  it''s. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ll paint it at another pair of eyes, mate, I. I don''t take exception to
  it at all. People looking at it like that. If you see something it''s not right,
  you tell me and I''ll. And I''ll get it sorted. But just tell me you don''t need
  to change. It yourself. Just say what about such and such a thing.'
- 'Them: Right. Cool.'
- 'Me: Because I do. I. I can''t look at everything. This is huge. It is absolutely
  huge.'
- 'Them: Oh, yes, I''m happy. I will just do my kind of just sanity checks. These
  are the campaigns that are on. These are the headlines that are shown to customers.
  You know, are we from a brand perspective? Are we missing anything? Is there any
  more new information or new. Bits that we should consider and then I''ll ping them
  over. But, yeah, so in terms of, like, eyes on, if you handle the pacing and the
  technical and the strategy side, we''ll work on that.'
- 'Me: And the copy and the images.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Then I''m. I''m. I''m happy to keep an eye on. What''s coming up in
  terms of. I''ll do all the asset briefs and stuff, so. And get those all delivered
  over. And then I will just keep an eye on from a. More from like a front end, what
  the customer might and might not be seeing. And just make sure that if there''s
  any tweaks we need to be doing,'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: Then.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I can throw in that over, but. Yeah, I guess I just want to be able to let
  you do your thing that you''re good at rather than having to.'
- 'Me: Well, I mean, the thing is. I mean, I''m on the. I''m on the back foot. Without
  a shadow of a doubt, because I have no idea. Well, I have a rough idea what the
  plan was. I''m kind of ready for the asset changes on Tuesday. The issue I''m going
  to have is images. Those the images per campaign. I have not got a clue what''s
  going to go where, and that''s going to be pain in the ass because I can''t necessarily
  do that. Programmatically, it''s going to be a case of going into the individual
  asset groups and picking what images to use. And it''s funny, last year I picked
  one images to use and nobody complained. I know we need to be put in the right thing
  out for the business, but, you know, it was a case just get. For me, it''s about
  getting images in there. First and foremost for quality scoring the account because
  it likes images and secondly, it''s making sure that the right images because I,
  I know they make most of the time and make diddly shit difference to whether it''s
  going to convert or not, especially on the pmax. It does. You know, there''s a huge
  amount of importance attached to the images because of brand, but in terms of actual
  performance,'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s. It. It''s minimal in the mix. It''s very minimal. But I will have to
  work through those manual, I think.'
- 'Them: And is there any way, is there anything I can be doing between now and then
  to just support that? Just thinking out loud, really? Like, is there anything you
  can give me and say, look. What are we putting these?'
- 'Me: Well.'
- 'Them: Or would you prefer that I''m just sort of doing checks once you''re doing
  stuff?'
- 'Me: I think it''s just doing checks. I mean, there''s a certain amount of knowledge
  is required on the Google Ads interface to see what images are going where.'
- 'Them: Y.'
- 'Me: And it has to be down into the asset because I have to drill down to the asset
  group, see what''s there, get rid of all the Black Friday ones. I can''t do that.
  Carte blanche. What I might do.'
- 'Them: Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: What I might do on Tuesday morning. First thing is just get rid of all the
  Black Friday images. And then start to add the images back in again. In terms of
  priority.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I think. Image. Image and text. If we
  just.'
- 'Me: That was Lauren''s favorite phrase. That makes sense. And you just look at
  it go. It doesn''t, does it?'
- 'Them: What? Oh, no.'
- 'Me: I shouldn''t take the mic.'
- 'Them: Don''t. No, I think if we just purge. The most important thing is that on
  Tuesday morning, any. Sniff of Black Friday is perched from these accounts.'
- 'Me: Yeah, that''s going to be the hard. One.'
- 'Them: And then. A case of just adding in the. Christmas gift in. I need to check
  what you have. I don''t know if I can see what.'
- 'Me: I mean, the thing is, if this, if they. If there are generic Christmas images.'
- 'Them: Was.'
- 'Me: Christmas gift images I can drop into everything. That''ll be awesome. Because
  then I can just go through and just blast it. I can just.'
- 'Them: Shall I just find the flipping folder that they chuck it all in and just.
  I''ll go and I''ll send them over. Just so you''ve got a visual reference of, like,
  all of these are absolutely fine to be chucked in.'
- 'Me: It took him anywhere.'
- 'Them: Yeah, and it''s like generic gifting.'
- 'Me: Yeah, that would be awesome.'
- 'Them: How. How are we going to work it from a. Structure point of view. So for
  P Max, will it just be. Generic Christmas gifting. Because then that would make
  sense. We could just chuck all of the generic Christmas gift in, and then we''ll
  go what category level with RSAs.'
- 'Me: I''m only saying. Yeah, I mean. Well, the RSA is no images. So are those. So
  the asset groups say for like the leather bags, both as a Christmas gifting image.
  That''s fine.'
- 'Them: Or you just. No, no, no. No, that''s fine.'
- 'Me: That''s not a problem. It doesn''t have to be a picture of a bag. You know,
  so if we can, if they. If there are a number of Christmas gifting images.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That you could show me. Then I can identify where they sit in Google Ads and
  prepare things. And it''s going to be mentally, because I''m going to have to do
  it. I''m going to have to do it in a, on a, on a manual basis. I will just go in
  and swap all those out for the, for the. The Black Friday ones and do that first
  thing on on Tuesday. I''ll have an early start or something on Tuesday and try and
  get them done before 9:00.'
- 'Them: Okay? I''ll find. I''ll get them to resend me the folder with all of the
  P. Max Christmas stuff that we had pre Black Friday. And then what I''ll probably
  do is. Have you got access to any folders and assets? How did Lauren normally give
  them to you?'
- 'Me: All over the show. I, I, I don''t know. I don''t know.'
- 'Them: Okay? Well, I do have a Google Drive folder, and I can say I can follow them.
  Christmas. Pmax gifting. Generic gift in. Everything in here is generic gifting.
  Do what you want with it.'
- 'Me: Go. That''s all I want.'
- 'Them: These images. I only want them on. Bags.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: For example, I''ll just folder in Google Drive show you the folder link.'
- 'Me: Eah. You make it as simple as you possibly can for me.'
- 'Them: And then. Yeah.'
- 'Me: That would be great.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: And then what I''ll do then is I''ll change. I''ll. I''ll swap out the Black
  Friday ones first. For the, for the generic gifting. And then if there''s any additional
  ones you want for specific asset groups, then I can add those in afterwards. But
  the priorities to get the Christmas gifts.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And I will just. I''ll say these can be used for this. Whether you
  actually have an asset group, live for it.'
- 'Me: Fantastic.'
- 'Them: Fine, doesn''t matter. But if you did, it''s there. If you wanted to make
  one, that''s there. If you don''t need to use it, don''t use it. So, okay, so I''ll
  do that. From an asset point, from a creative imagery point of view, that''s fine.
  And I''LL share that with you today.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Brilliant. Wonderful. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Let''s just talk about. Headlines and descriptions for a minute, so. Did
  we before we change to from Christmas to Black Friday, did we save down.'
- 'Me: Yep, got them all.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: Thankfully.'
- 'Them: Is there anything on there? That you think I need to have a look at? Because
  I know we made lots of, like, can we change this to this? Or this wasn''t. The free
  delivery threshold was wrong. Is there anything. You can share over with me and
  I''ll just go for a review and change just so that we''re not putting back anyone.
  So like anything that we''ve any business as usual headlines and descriptions that
  we''ve corrected over this period.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: We''re not then going to put. The outdated ones back in.'
- 'Me: Y. Ep. Now. That''s the folder. That''s the g sheet. Just give you. Editor.'
- 'Them: There.'
- 'Me: So that that workbook has got us ad copy, uk, Europe and rest of world.'
- 'Them: Okay, perfect. So I''ll just scan it and if there''s any. Things that are
  factually out of date, I will just create it. And I guess then that''s your. That''s
  your kind of, like, copy bank, is it? For want of a better word.'
- 'Me: That. That. That structure in there is brilliant for me. I''ve got something
  that works on that.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So any copy going forward. I know you''ve got your own version of the copy,
  but that. Is is more workable for me than what we have at the moment. I find the
  one we''ve got at the moment is a bit all over the show, and I know that''s because
  it''s marketing need to look at it and approve and all the rest of it, but.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it just serves a different purpose, that''s all.'
- 'Me: It does. It does. But for me, that I can take that I''ve written something.
  That takes that and puts it in.'
- 'Them: Right, okay. Fine. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.'
- 'Me: So it makes it easy for me to see it that way. But bear that in. Bear in mind,
  having said that, that is what will go in. Yeah. So if you have a little bit of
  a Tourette''s moment on one of those boxes, then that''s what will get loaded up.
  So there''s no. There''s no double check on it. That''s raw data. That. That''s
  the stuff that I use.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: So just handle with care.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That''s fine. That''s fine. Okay, and then the last. The second question
  on copy. So the next sort of marketing activation is this 20 off selected GIFs.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: That''s from the 8th of December till the 14th. Now that the theme around
  that, I mean, that''s literally this idea was born at like 4:00 yesterday afternoon.
  It is sticking with the Christmas gifting theme. But 20 selected amount of our Christmas
  gifts. We''ll have 20 off. So. What I was saying yesterday was, I think. We could
  probably just drop in headlines and descriptions to. Because they''ll complement
  the Christmas messaging anyway, because it''s Christmas gift in promo. I don''t
  want to do a takeover like Black Friday. It''s not that kind of thing. It''s more.
  Here''s half a dozen headlines. And half a dozen descriptions. Put them, sprinkle
  them where they need to be sprinkled. So that, you know, customers see them. But
  we''re not kind of wholesale changing anything.'
- 'Me: Did you see that? Just. Just on that point, then, did you see that the conversion
  rate graphs are sent over to Lauren yesterday? And we saw.'
- 'Them: For the headlines.'
- 'Me: No, it was the conversion rates.'
- 'Them: You send out an email on the teams group.'
- 'Me: No, I think you sent it on teams. Oh, it was. It was partly to do with the
  search impression share as well.'
- 'Them: Oh, was that around the. I saw something.'
- 'Me: Let me just share my screen with you.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Rather than me trying to guess what.'
- 'Me: This is. It''s. Yeah. Oh, I can visualize it now. So this is conversion rate
  year on year.'
- 'Them: Y.'
- 'Me: And it''s really quite interesting to see, like, the uk, what happened then.
  The UK. This just freak you out completely for 2025? We see that big drop here.
  We see another one for the US there. Not as noticeable for Europe, but those two
  there. That''s when we changed the asset groups. That''s when we did that massive
  change.'
- 'Them: Okay. So is that. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So this is what I was warning about prior to Christmas and about the
  stats through about what was the impact of going to Black Friday. Wholesale. That''s
  the impact. So we see this and we go, oh, that''s amazing, isn''t it? Look at it.
  It''s the conversion rate here, but how much did that cost? There for that to drop
  down and come back up again. It takes two or three days every time for the. So it
  goes into sort of like a mini learning phase.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: When you change that much stuff because it has to reassess what it is. So the
  idea when we go into sale of let''s just take it easy.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And let''s just change a headline. And rely on merchant promoter. The merchant
  extension. Promotion Extensions. Can I get it right? Promotion extensions within
  the search ads. So that''s where you get an extra little bit of text underneath
  the ad and then within the shopping ads, which is the majority of your. Your generic
  traffic.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It will have a strike, say it''s a sale, so. That''s the difference.'
- 'Them: So how do we.'
- 'Me: Between them.'
- 'Them: How do we. I don''t know if this is a process thing, but how do we find the
  balance between. And it only happens. There''s only Black Friday in Sale where this
  happens. And it''s like, well. It''s a bit like, obviously, when the window changes
  on Christmas and then all the red banners come down for sale.'
- 'Me: Absolutely.'
- 'Them: Like we. We need to have. Just kind of figure out the best way to. We need
  to have maximum visibility for sale from the 24th.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: How do we achieve that? Without chopping the head off. Conversion rate. Is
  it like you say, launching with. You know, obviously, the merchant center promotion
  and two to three headlines, and then can we drop in? Can we. Can we just increase
  it every day, the visibility?'
- 'Me: I think.'
- 'Them: Rather than dropping everything in on launch day. Launch night.'
- 'Me: If you think what happens? We get these 15 headlines to get dropped in. So,
  like, the majority of them, pretty much. Well, pretty much all of them were changed.
  So it''s going to go Shit. I don''t know what to do here.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: If you actually just went in and did three or four.'
- 'Them: Okay, that''s that. That''ll be happy with.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: Because there''s. There''s only three or four ways to say up to 50% off.'
- 'Me: There''s only so many ways to say Black Friday. We still managed 15. Yeah.
  So we''ve got to be careful with that, actually. And those stats are sent over about
  the performance of the headlines over. Over this last seven days, this short period
  of time. There''s a lot of traffic has been that it''s the promo ones that work
  the best. Now. Promo ones work the best. I think click through rate and conversion
  rates were the best. So what Google''s going to do is it''s going to go well. I''m
  going to show them then.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So it''s going to do it anyway. It''s going to. It''s going to. It''s
  going to promote those anyway. You can have an asset group, which is sale.'
- 'Them: Eah.'
- 'Me: So the sale one gets set up alongside what you''ve already got. Never stop
  what we''ve already got. Apart from Christmas. But that''s a whole campaign. But
  you set up the sale asset group. And the audiences that it''s promoting are people
  who are interested in a sale. So the search themes within there will be about a
  sale. So that''s specifically people looking for a sale and you drop that in alongside
  what we''ve already got. So there''ll be the duplication. It doesn''t matter. With
  asset groups, all the asset group is a different view on a different group of products
  so you can have the same products in the same thing. So you drop that in there.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: On everywhere. You have an account level promotion extension.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: The sale one will be very in your face. This is a sale. Whereas the ones that,
  the existing ones will have two or three headlines that you will change and we can
  just drop them at the bottom of the. Of the headlines. Just replace the bottom three
  headlines we''ve already got in the R6 groups with sale. Google go. Oh, what''s
  that? Oh, new shiny thing. Let''s go and have a look at that. They''ll put it up
  there. And if it''s a sale. You might find them. Immediately, people start increasing,
  they click through, rate will start to go up and so therefore it will then show
  more.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Then at the end of it, we swap those out to what they were previously. And
  happy days.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, well, I''m happy. I''m happy with us. Magic. I think maybe it''s.
  An educational piece for the people here as well, and just in terms of, you know,
  because.'
- 'Me: Very much.'
- 'Them: Especially when you kind of see the data. I''d be really interested. I know
  it''s not. Apples and apples, but. We did what we did on Black Friday. Fine. We
  now managed to sail the way you''ve just described, so I''m happy with that. Because
  I haven''t got 50. I don''t need to put 15 headlines in. We''ve got. Like you say,
  for example, being extreme. You''ve got 10 business as usual, Christmas gifting.
  Christmas. Well, not Christmas gifted by them, but, you know, autumn, wintery Christmas,
  lovely business as usual stuff. And then five sale ones.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then off you go.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I would be interested post sale as much as we can to kind of see. How we''ve
  not necessarily damaged conversion rates with the asset changes because we''re doing
  a lot less asset changes, therefore, because that''d be a really good piece to kind
  of show the business to say, look. We''re managing it this way. There''s actually,
  you know. A lot less detrimental effects. Than what we did this time. So, yeah,
  I mean, that''s absolutely fine. And I think.'
- 'Me: This is huge analysis piece on that. It''d be. It''d be fascinating to see.
  And the actual impact of the. Of the gifting one for Christmas. If we get it wrong,
  it''s less impact than the Black Friday one.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But then we. We. I''ll take both of those and go. This is what happened at
  that time. Let''s do this big dobber of an analysis and say what was the right approach.
  And then come up with a. With a. A formula, if you like, for the. For the future.
  So I''m supposing this is what will happen. You know, that, that, that. And we can
  see from that conversion rate depth that that''s what happened with the Black Friday.
  But will the same thing happen with the change in the not changing as many headlines
  in the asset groups? I actually don''t know. But based upon best practices. And
  what Google have been saying, you don''t do that, you just do a few of them.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And I. I agree. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It all makes sense. The logic is there. So it''s. Whether it appears in practice
  or not is a different matter, but.'
- 'Them: Well, you''ve got. You''ve got the data for Black Friday. I mean, that''s.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Quite. You know, it''s difficult to argue with that.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: Okay, so.'
- 'Me: What date is that? The sale.'
- 'Them: 24th is when it starts. So as a christmas eve one. And it not we have to
  normally wait until. So we''ll figure out process wise, kind of, you know, how much
  you want to throw to me to just kind of click go, but it''s normally like, When
  the last store shuts, we can then press go on the sale.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So even if you''ve got everything set up, I''ll be working. Until Sal goes
  live anyway. So even if you just want to give me.'
- 'Me: Is that 5:00?'
- 'Them: Go through and. It''s between 4 and 6 on Christmas Eve. So we try and finish
  early on Christmas Eve. Because it''s Christmas Eve. But we just literally just
  sat by. Sat by desks at home, waiting for the store to shut. And then you can go.
  Yeah, normally. Or at least half waiting to just press go.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: And then we press go and everything between four and six.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But. By all means. If you can get it to a place where we''re ready. And you
  just need me to go. In, enable some asset groups or whatever.'
- 'Me: I don''t know. I don''t. I don''t. I don''t think there''s anything I could
  give you to press a button on.'
- 'Them: Is it something that can be scheduled if we closer to the time new right?
  It''s going live.'
- 'Me: Well, we''re swapping out. You see, that''s the problem. We''re swapping out.
  We''re swapping out. Asset groups are really weird. You can''t. As you keep your
  asset group as it is, because that''s where the history is. I know what you do.
  We''re swapping out text, we''re swapping out images.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s not as easy to do that as if you had an RSA or something, like a text
  ad where you could just run it in parallel with it and just flick it over. Or say
  now on pause. Pause that one. Make that one live. You can''t do that with Mass.
  You got to physically go in and do it.'
- 'Them: Yes. I mean, I''m familiar with. Going into asset groups.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Be it up to go into every single asset group in all four accounts and
  shake if it had lines.'
- 'Them: If I. If I. If I had to, then that''s an option. You know, if you were. If.
  If you were to. If you could provide me with the ones you want. Updating.'
- 'Me: It is a massive job. I could probably if based upon what happens with this
  the flick over from Black Friday to Christmas. This spreadsheet that I''ve just
  shared with you is our master spreadsheet. Okay? Of assets. If this. If this switchover
  works well. Then I''m going to use this spreadsheet as our spreadsheet for going
  forward, so we can actually change it on here. And then I can just run something.
  And it will just import all those and replace what we''ve already got.'
- 'Them: Right.'
- 'Me: So I''m going to use the learnings from this. For the 24th.'
- 'Them: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Me: Because that''s a bit more critical. If it. If this goes. If this goes tits
  up on Tuesday and doesn''t run through, there''s no reason I''ve. I''ve done that
  many dry runs of it and I''ve used another client to try it on as well in. In real
  life, so. If this. If this works, it just means on the 24, I just have to give it
  a command here, and it will pull in whatever''s in that spreadsheet. So we save
  that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Then. It should be fine. You know, so we can. I can just go in and go, well,
  let''s change these headlines, you know, 13, 14, 15 will change into this. Or let''s
  change the Christmas ones to the. The. The. The new version for gifting, and then
  it will just suck it in. And.'
- 'Them: Right. So in theory, you could.'
- 'Me: Then.'
- 'Them: Upload all of these. Just, you know, you''re not. Yes, I''m not. On Christmas
  Eve. If we said right. Half past four. Go, go, go.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Do that. All your changes happen, and then we''re good.'
- 'Me: Yeah. All the text will go in. I''m going to experiment with images, see whether
  there''s anything we do with that. I don''t think we can. I don''t think there''s
  anything we can do with images because it. They''re held in a very strange way within
  Google Ads, you know? It''s like image id. It''s not obvious what it is. And you
  can''t pull the. The URL of the image and show the image in the. In the spread I''m
  getting very technically. But you can''t show it in the G sheet, so you have to
  know what it is.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So you can''t put right. Okay, so you can''t just have a column for
  image URL, and then you''ve got the path. Okay. We''re not going to have a huge
  amount because again, it''s going to be a graphic. It''s going to be image wise.
  It''ll be similar to Black Friday.'
- 'Me: And how gonna last for.'
- 'Them: In terms of. That will go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I''ve got it for five weeks at
  the minute, so until almost the last week of January.'
- 'Me: Okay? See if I put the 28th or something.'
- 'Them: Go for. 25th. So the 24th of December to the 25th. Of jan. The added complexity,
  which isn''t a problem today. Is there''ll be three phases to this. Sale.'
- 'Me: Woohoo.'
- 'Them: Which will just record, say, just require just copy and possibly an image.
  Replacement. And that is so you''ve got up to 50% off launch on the 24th. Then I
  suspect in the first week of Jan. Ten days into Jan, it will change to further reductions.
  Tbc. Whether we update assets for that I''m not sure yet, but then the last week
  or so. Will be up to 50% off, plus an extra 10% with this code.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So there will likely be three phases again. But I''d say we are a little
  bit off getting. Confirmation. I''m going to prep copy briefs. And asset briefs
  based on that happening, and then it''ll either be there to use or not.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: One just question on this GIFS thing in terms of process and what''s the
  best way for us to work. The paid media ad copy Google sheet. That I currently.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Use to put in the headlines and descriptions. Now. Does it make sense that
  I only add the descriptions in here? That should be added rather than trying to
  have everything in here. You''ve already got it in your sheet.'
- 'Me: No, I''m not with you.'
- 'Them: So bear with. So I''m just going to share. Can you see that?'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Okay, so 20 off gifs, live day, end date. Fine. Normally these headlines
  are full. With all of the BAU stuff, and then someone would drop in a few 20% off
  gift headlines.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Would you prefer that I only kept in this headlines the stuff that needs
  to be that is related to the thing we''re talking about? So if I just put in three
  headlines for 20% off GIFs.'
- 'Me: Do you know what I really like?'
- 'Them: And then. Gone.'
- 'Me: Is for you not to use, not for me not to not look at that spreadsheet at all.
  For me to just be using for you to be going into, because I trust you now, is for
  you to be going into that one. That would be the ideal situation for me.'
- 'Them: How would be the best way for me to know where you want. Where you might
  want those. Headlines. Or descriptions to go. Or is that a.'
- 'Me: It doesn''t matter.'
- 'Them: Moot point.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it doesn''t matter. 1. One thing that you''re going to notice when I
  do this swap over the of the assets is that you might not have in headline one smice
  in a Bond Street. At the top. It might be shop bags, stationary and more. And that
  again, going to be an educational piece. Just because it''s in position one doesn''t
  mean that''s the priority at all. There is no priority in.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: There.'
- 'Them: And how do we know what''s the easiest way for me to kind of know what you''ve
  got? What should be updated then. Okay, so if I was to. If I keep my sheet just
  as a. Because that''s what we''re using internally.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So I will probably only just put in the headlines and the descriptions that
  relate to the proceed in this case 29 gives because then I know I''ve only got to
  put these into your sheet.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: When I''m now looking at so pretend I''ve got those. I''m now looking at
  your sheet and I''m going to update the uk. I copy headlines.'
- 'Me: It''s not easy.'
- 'Them: Is there a way for me to know what we''ve currently got live so that I''m
  not? Because, for example, there''s stuff down towards the bottom that rows 28,
  29 to 35 that like references. Spring Summer 24.'
- 'Me: Yeah, they could come out. Sorry. I didn''t realize.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That.'
- 'Them: No, no, that''s fine, but it''s just so that I don''t go through and update
  everything. Is there a way where you could say, look, just like, update the ones
  that are in bold?'
- 'Me: Just.'
- 'Them: Because those are the ones that we''re using.'
- 'Me: I''ve just got rid of the I''ve just got rid of the ones that were not using.'
- 'Them: Okay, cool. So if I was once. I''ve got my copy for the gifts.'
- 'Me: I will update that. Mate. I will go in and update that. I didn''t realize.
  Lauren''s got this together based upon some stuff I sent over to her.'
- 'Them: Right.'
- 'Me: So I''m not. Let me do a clean on this. I''ll clean the fire. I''ll clean it
  up. And everything that''s in there is live.'
- 'Them: Okay, that''s. That''s helpful. And then I will only update. I will have
  to. I presume I will need to say to you. Right. Peter, I''m ready to put the new
  headlines in. Just to make sure that that''s not going to be sucked up.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, for example. I obviously wouldn''t put anything to do with 20 off gifts
  in here. Now, until we''ve we''re post Black Friday.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, for example, the promo starts on the 8th, so I might put these. In. On
  the fourth or fifth next week. And then I''ll send you a message. Say, look, all
  you have 20% off gifts, headlines and descriptions are now in.'
- 'Me: The 8th, I think with 24th. Oh, for the gifting one.'
- 'Them: Sorry, we''re on the. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yep. Sorry.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''m just thinking process wise. I think we need to. Obviously, I need
  to be clear with you that when I''m making actions to the sheet,'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So that you don''t do an update. And accidentally pull in half of the 20%
  off gift stuff, because I haven''t told you that.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I''m putting it in. So.'
- 'Me: See, once I''ve run this. So this. This will get run on Tuesday and all these
  headlines and descriptions will get sucked in.'
- 'Them: Yes. So I obviously won''t do anything for the next promo until after we''re
  back to normal.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: At which point. I''ll let you know that I''m updating it, and I''ll let you
  know when it''s updated.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So I know it''s not ideal this, but I like this. Will get.'
- 'Them: But if the process is clear, it''s. It''s fine. Yeah, I mean, I don''t. I
  don''t mind.'
- 'Me: The only concern is that, you know, you. The unbeknownst to you, you''re going
  to be changing stuff that''s working really well. I. I don''t have time to. To accommodate
  that at all.'
- 'Them: Well, I''m. I''m going to have to do it just based on taking stuff out that''s
  just not appropriate.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So. Yeah. So if we do.'
- 'Me: Exploring it. Take it out. Weird. But, yeah, it''s. You know, I think. I think
  you know enough about it to. To be able to say. You know, a modern take on an icon
  isn''t the best, but.'
- 'Them: No. So, I mean, that''s not going to affect performance. Yeah. So I''ll look
  at it anyway. And based on. Based on the asset group itself. I''ll have a good idea.
  If there''s any that look quite similar, that actually, I can replace that. So I
  won''t just replace the first three headlines every time. I''ll go through and look
  at all the headlines of which are the most appropriate ones to change.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And it''s more likely to be the ones towards the back.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: That. Are, you know, from a. From a legacy viewpoint, because I think people
  just got tired by the time they got there and just whack any old thing.'
- 'Them: No, that''s. Yeah, just to try and get the score up.'
- 'Me: You know, this is. Yeah. And this is a big piece. To do in years to just. Just
  to do that optimization, see what works and what doesn''t work.'
- 'Them: Okay? That''s okay. That. No, that''s absolutely fine. So I''m happy to do
  that. So I''ll manage the internal sheet. And then I will. Just because I''ll use
  that internally to show separate this. Is how we''re going to be.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Talking.'
- 'Me: And then we can work on this. You know, we can. We can work on this after.
  After Christmas. And just get this into. Into a place where, you know, you can change
  stuff in here.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it''s going to get implemented, but I can also add my influence to it.'
- 'Them: Y.'
- 'Me: You know, and I would suggest. Well, I mean, the sale ones are fine. I mean,
  it''s just, you know, up to half selected items. You just. No need to do it.'
- 'Them: Es.'
- 'Me: You know, don''t go over 30 characters on the headlines. The. The rest of it
  is, you know, it''s. It isn''t really rocket science when you''re doing a.'
- 'Them: No, no, it''s fine. And that. I mean, that''s what I''m. I like money. All.
  Pay me a sheet because I''ve got my. Formula in there to tell me when I''ve gone
  over. And to be honest, 30 characters is not bloody long either. Like, the amount
  of times I''m on 31, I think.'
- 'Me: Life.'
- 'Them: By sake. Okay, well, I think process wise, we''re in a good spot then. So
  I''ve got some actions on assets. Quite some actions on copy. That''s all fine.'
- 'Me: Okay? I''ve got some further testing to do on this this week, just to make
  sure it will actually pull it in on Tuesday. Because that''ll be a pain in the ass
  if it doesn''t. I''ve got all sorts of backups to. To. To go.'
- 'Them: No, that''s right. I think that''s the, that''s the priority. That would
  be the next priority, obviously, trading through this week and then the switch over
  from the second and then just in terms of.'
- 'Me: There''s also the rsas to do as well.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah, I do like an rsa because I get more control.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I enjoy every control over stuff.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: The rs. The RSA isn''t in that list. It''s just the assets. I''m going to have
  to. I''m going to have to think about that as well. Is how we''re going to change
  the RSAs. This is where the customizers came in really nicely.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Because on my paid media copy thing I have got a section where I will
  fill in an RSA. Ad for copy for UK and one for US. For example, for this 20 off
  gifts. So I guess for the promos, you''re not going to put low again. We''re not
  going to fill it up with. It''s just putting a one description, one headline.'
- 'Me: I wouldn''t even change the descriptions. It''s. It is a headliner sale. It''s
  just bang, you know, people aren''t going to pass that point. And if he''s got underneath,
  the description will be the. The promotion extension anyway.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Pushing it.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: But if you''ve got some. If you''ve got some wording on the sale, that''d be
  great, because then I can. I can schedule in the promotion extension to start next,
  you say the 8th?'
- 'Them: Eighth to the fourteenth. Yeah, and I''ll have a code as well, but I just
  need it confirmed. That should be confirmed this week.'
- 'Me: Okay? So the countdown timer for Black Friday. Just a wording on that, then.'
- 'Them: Right. Yes, I meant to ask. Because I.'
- 'Me: No worries. Or you just ping that over whenever and I''ll get that set up.'
- 'Them: I''ll have to check. Yeah, because that was the one where she suggested the
  headline. It was like, sale ends six days or something, wasn''t it? And I said we
  need to not call it sale, because we don''t.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And it''s just. I don''t know. It''s Black Friday promotion. Plug. And
  you. You. You''re quite limited. I can''t tell you. I can''t actually tell you what
  sort of length that''s going to have to be because. It''s a. It''s a variable, the
  countdown bit. So just make it as short as you can. I''ll put it in and see what
  it works. Now if it doesn''t fit, then I''ll let you know, but after I put it into
  Google Ads to find out whether it''s happy with it or not. Because it has to bear
  in mind how much it''s going to expand out because it might be like, sale ends in
  23 minutes. Towards the end.'
- 'Them: All right. Okay. Yeah. So at the minute, it''s quite short because it''s
  just four days, and then when it gets into.'
- 'Me: This is not. It''ll be that accurate.'
- 'Them: Six hours. Right. It''s going to end up being. I''ll confirm on teams in
  a minute, but it''ll end up being something like.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Black Friday ends.'
- 'Me: Great. That''s the kind of thing.'
- 'Them: Black black Friday ends in.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: I mean, because any more than that, you''re in danger of running over on
  the final day anyway, so.'
- 'Me: Eah. Yes, you are. But, I mean, sale is great because there''s only four letters,
  but, you know, if that''s. If that can''t be, then that can''t be.'
- 'Them: It''s only because. Yeah, it''s only good. It''s more of a political thing.'
- 'Me: Yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: Internally.'
- 'Me: Because. United discount site, that''s why.'
- 'Them: Exactly. Exactly. Despite. Despite the messaging.'
- 'Me: All the time.'
- 'Them: And then I''ve got one final, final, final thing which you won''t like, but
  I think Seb has given me a bit of a JFDI on it. He would like. 3aspinall targeting.
  He wants us to do it. I think if we just spent 50 quid a day until Monday.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Just to show that it''s. It''s just because I keep talking to him about it
  internally.'
- 'Me: It''s spaffed a load of money away already and it''s, doesn''t it?'
- 'Them: No, no, I know.'
- 'Me: I think the thing I disagree with is where it was said that let''s do this
  because it''ll force them to back off a little bit. It won''t have any effect whatsoever.'
- 'Them: I know. Yeah. And that almost. Almost. That''s almost a quote. That I put
  in there.'
- 'Me: Really? Well, the. The. The thing that. The thing that we sent over yesterday
  about Black, about that. And the fact the reason you had an impression sharedrop
  on brands. Last week is because Lawrence took the budget down from 800 quid to 200
  quid. That''s why she did it. But. Excuse my French, but. She. She took it down
  from 800 quid to 200 quid. So it was. The reason was budget. Nothing else at all.
  We''re back up to 98 impression share now.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I think it''s the overlap rate is the issue as well. So last year,'
- 'Me: Yeah, but they will. They will do it.'
- 'Them: Well, last year it was only 15% at this time of the year. Now we''re I think
  last seven days last year was 15. Now it''s at 75.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, well, that''s.'
- 'Them: So they''ve made a conscious.'
- 'Me: That''s up to them.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: Influence that at all.'
- 'Them: Oh, no, no, no, no. I know. Apart from, you know. But again, I think this
  is more of a political decision from.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Our, you know, Paolo. So whoever obviously pissed off that it''s happening.
  And want us.'
- 'Me: How are they measuring what impact that has, though?'
- 'Them: I suppose he''s looking at from a what''s the impact?'
- 'Me: He''s going on sorrow.'
- 'Them: Well, that, but also what''s the impact on CPCs? Because obviously CPCs for
  brand seem to have jumped up quite a bit.'
- 'Me: Nothing. Perhaps nothing to do with Aspinall''s. Well, it will be to do with
  Aspinall''s, but that''s up to them. You know, they quadrupled the CPC''s year on
  year. That''s why the brand is so inefficient.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: In their roas. But we can''t. We can''t change that CPC by going and bidding
  on someone else''s brown. The two things are disconnected completely.'
- 'Them: No, I know, I know, I know.'
- 'Me: Sorry. I''m just. I''m just.'
- 'Them: No, no, no, no. I know that because I''ve had to kind of go and look at the
  data. So what he does know is that obviously the C3Cs are increased by x percent
  and the overlap rate and the competition for the brand keywords, unlike brand exact,
  for example. Has increased year on year. The CPCs have therefore increased year
  on year, which means that we''re having to spend more money to kind of maintain
  an impression, share. Rather than doing anything else and put it into non brand.
  And you''re quite right. There''s all you can do to influence that. But the pushback
  I''m getting is, well, I want you to target them. And it is a bit nonsensical in
  the sense that we''re, we''re only going to use. But also we''re only going to use,
  for example, 50 quid. A day which is not even going to tickle their feet. Because
  they''ll be spending 1500 pound a day on their own brand.'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: But.'
- 'Me: They''re probably spending 1500 quid a day on. On smarting as well, so they''re
  obviously worried and it will be costing them an absolute fortune.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but it''s. I don''t know whether he knows someone aspan on you. It''s
  a personal thing, but it. It''s one of those where.'
- 'Me: Before with another client. He just wanted me to go get someone else just because
  he didn''t like them.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, so I''ve just. I''ve just stopped. Well, not arguing, but I''ve
  stopped, kind of. I''ve just said to him, look, we''ll do the. I think the P. Max
  one probably needs pausing. Because obviously that''s just throwing up. This needs
  to be like a really specifically targeted thing. So I think if we. The smise and
  search competitor, there''s a UK competitor ad group.'
- 'Me: Okay? Yeah.'
- 'Them: If we. Reactivate this competitor search campaign and only as we had done,
  only target Aspinall. We''ve got Aspanol London diaries in there, which I''m not.
  Entirely sure if we can pause that.'
- 'Me: Okay? I added. I had it down for ten quid, but I''ll. I''ll put it to 50.'
- 'Them: Stick. Stick 50 quid on it, and then on Monday I''ll go to the meeting.'
- 'Me: Go have a budget, though. Mate.'
- 'Them: I''ll rob. Blame seb. If this is one of those examples internally where you
  can''t win.'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: Because. You resist doing the thing because it doesn''t make sense, but then
  because you didn''t do it. You can''t then argue that it didn''t work. So.'
- 'Me: You could say we spent 300, 313 quid on that. We got seven quid. But how is
  that ever a good business decision?'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, let''s do that. Let''s do the. That search one, and then.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve got three keywords in there. Aspen all of London. Aspen of London
  diaries. Asked me all 2026 diary.'
- 'Them: I mean, I don''t need the diaries. No. Get rid of Aspinall 20.'
- 'Me: Do you want me to do? Just Aspinall.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. And it''s exact match, isn''t it? So I don''t know.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Whether I don''t know whether people search.'
- 'Me: I could have asked in all trade.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so that would just be Aspinal, plus anything else.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Do that as a phrase match.'
- 'Them: Yeah, because there''ll be Aspinall. People search for Aspinalls.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: But. Yeah, yeah, pause the diaries. Related ones. Phrase match on Aspinall.
  50 quid a day and then. I''ll look at this account on Monday and then we''ll say
  all of the good use of 300 quid, whatever else.'
- 'Me: Stop buying mummy.'
- 'Them: It''s politics. I''ll tell you.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And another reason for me not working for somebody
  rather than me. Yeah. Being me freelance. It just drive me absolutely nuts. I''m
  glad you''re dealing with that end of it.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s the stuff I. I will do. That''s the. That''s what I bring to
  the table.'
- 'Me: Cool. You''re welcome.'
- 'Them: Cool. That''s all the bits, then. So I''m clear on pbc assets.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: And what we''re doing. So I''ll folder them all up, send the links across
  Google Drive links. All be there for.'
- 'Me: For God''s sakes. Talk about being connected. Now the phone rings on my. On
  my computer as well, which is great for talking, but when I''m on a call like this
  with phone rings and it''s my daughter and it''s just like, Last order dates.'
- 'Them: Yes, I have got them. So they''ll come over before lunch as well.'
- 'Me: Great stuff.'
- 'Them: And I think last year we just put a site link in. To say, you know, I''ve
  got. I''ve got them here, actually. I''ve got a tab for it in my document delivery
  cut off site link. Order by 22nd December. Description. I want for delivery by Christmas
  to trip from line two shop now.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: So I''ve got all of those. I''ll update all the dates.'
- 'Me: I presume they''re being from last year. Were they?'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''ll just double check because I have been sent them now.'
- 'Me: Okay? Because what I''ll also do is put those if you''ve got. If you got them
  in text when they''re last order date is by country. That''ll be fantastic.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely uk, US And Europe, because that all comes out
  of the Europe one all comes out of European.'
- 'Me: Okay? So what I''ll be doing then is I will be.'
- 'Them: Hub.'
- 'Me: Applying that. I''ll be using that for the. The budget tracking. Or the the
  budget prediction so that I can start to pull back on budgets based upon that last
  order date. So Christmas Christmas gift is one of Christmas gift campaign. If it''s
  they''re not going to get it in time so I can stop all on that last order date.'
- 'Them: And we have to. No. Yeah, that. That''s pretty much what we did last year.
  It''s almost. You almost stop spending entirely. For what would the normal one over
  there.'
- 'Me: Yeah. No problem.'
- 'Them: In. It''s like if normally like a few days they save the last UK that it
  was the 22nd and then between the. On the 23rd and up until we put so long on the
  24th, we don''t really.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: It''s like the two days of the year where there''s nothing really to say.'
- 'Me: No, that''s.'
- 'Them: But yeah. So assets.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve just started factoring in P9. Because that starts next week. So
  I''m just looking at budgets and stuff and looking at.'
- 'Them: I would say usual process.'
- 'Me: Like the predictions and stuff for. For sales, when things are going to tail
  off and all the rest. In that way, the budget is going to fit in with that. Do we
  have a P10 now? A budget for P10?'
- 'Them: So you P10. Google spend a P10 is 14 1.'
- 'Me: O. Kay. Right.'
- 'Them: And you''ve got one. 81. 81. For p9.'
- 'Me: P9. Yep, yep, no problem.'
- 'Them: But bearing in mind as well, obviously, we talked about possibly having a
  lack of, you know, having sort of front loaded to spend this one. Cyber Monday is
  p1, is p9.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So you. Yeah. So you''ve got.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I''m going to leave it. I''m not even going to change the budget on Monday.
  I don''t want to. I don''t want to piss about with it at all.'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: Monday''s budget will be what it is. And then hopefully on Tuesday get around
  to just reassessing the budgets for. For P9. I''ve started it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Based upon last year''s trajectory, which is difficult because of rest of the
  world not being around at that time. But the rest of the world cut off is going
  to be before, well, before everybody else, isn''t it? So that will need to be factored
  in as well. So I''m not going to finish. Doing the strategy on P9 until I know what
  the last order date says.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because that was. It''s going to have an impact. Well, I''ll factor in that
  impact on how much it''s going to spend.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, fine. So I''ll send you over last dates. I''ll get all these
  stuff for Tuesday boxed up into folders.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And sent across and then. There''s no actions on a copy font for me. On your
  feet at the moment. The next thing I''ll do on that will be for the gifts promo
  on the 8th.'
- 'Me: Okay? Just.'
- 'Them: Which I''ll do Thursday next week.'
- 'Me: So just a quick one from a. From a personal perspective. Well, personal business
  perspective. This is taking a lot of time. I''m not going to hold you to ransom
  here on this at all. I know that the situation. I''m not about to increase my. My
  fee or anything like this. This is taking a massive amount of my time at the moment.
  Just what it noted. And also, what''s the plan for the New year? Do you? I know
  it''s only yesterday she went, but you must have it in your head as to what''s likely
  to be happening.'
- 'Them: Well, it''ll be a bit. Bit of a coin toss at the moment, to be honest.'
- 'Me: Right whether to take it back in house or to leave it as.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. And it will depend. It''ll depend on when we kind of go out there
  to.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: If there really is nothing. Then I''m not going to do it.'
- 'Me: Okay? All right. Okay?'
- 'Them: But yeah, I think one thing for us to kind of ever think about over the next
  days, weeks, etc. Is how do we kind of. Get our. Coalition, your time perspective,
  how do we kind of protect your time in terms of kind of how we were working over
  the summer? Or is it just a seasonal thing? Is it because of the seasonality? It''s
  a lot warmer. So how do we switch, you and I, get the balance back to what we had
  over the summer when we looked?'
- 'Me: Yeah. I mean, as. As far as I''m. If I. And this is the. This is the reason
  for asking the question, because for me, there''s loads of projects to do. There''s
  loads of projects to do in that sort of out of season time to get this back into
  a state of. Even prior to when I first started with you, you know, it all needs
  sorting out. All the feeds and he''s sorting out. There needs to be processes put
  in place for doing what we''re doing now, which is changing text and so on. An organization
  for the images.'
- 'Them: At that.'
- 'Me: A strategy going forward, being able to produce forecasts and stuff.'
- 'Them: Probably what was happening there because.'
- 'Me: There''s a lot of. There''s a lot of stuff. Off season to be done.'
- 'Them: More lines and sound. More bindings as well. They were going to start invisible.
  They are going to be. We just need to have a check rate and make sure that we''re
  discovered. Shit. And all of that started replacing us in there for the whole rookie
  room. Step out. Inventory assigned.'
- 'Me: Looking at now? I wish that one. But. It is, and there''s nothing we can do
  about it. Right. Now. That''s a massive project. So anyway. Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah, no, I hear that. Cool. Okay, let me come back with those actions, then.'
- 'Me: All right.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Anything else? Ping me. Hopefully it will kind of. It''ll be a bit.
  More streamlined. Let''s go with this.'
- 'Me: Hopefully. Happy black Friday, mate.'
- 'Them: Yeah, you too. I''ll speech in a bit. Cheers. By. E.'

## Executive Summary

- Lauren was let go due to performance issues and lack of independent account management
- Current performance is strong, with 37% new customers and +19-23% vs forecast
- Transitioning from Black Friday to Christmas campaigns with a more measured approach

## Attendees

- -- Enhanced Notes ---
- ### Lauren’s Departure & Decision Rationale
- Made decision to let Lauren go yesterday due to performance issues
- Key problems identified:
- Lacked confidence managing accounts independently
- Required excessive oversight and hand-holding
- Made fundamental errors (wrong Black Friday promo dates, missing Cyber Monday)
- Struggled in team meetings when questioned about paid search performance
- No clear organization for Christmas launch planning
- Would have taken 2+ weeks to get basic deliverables that Peter provides immediately
- Wasn’t the right fit for internal paid search expert role despite clear job requirements
- ### Current Performance & Metrics
- Strong recent performance metrics:
- Last week: 1,500 online shoppers, 37% were new customers (up 2% vs last year)
- Monday: +9% vs forecast, +10% vs last year, +14% like-for-like
- Tuesday: +19% vs forecast, +21% vs last year, +23% like-for-like
- Customer base recovery: only 4% below last year (previously 10% down)
- Conversion rate analysis shows significant drops when wholesale asset changes made
- Black Friday changeover caused 2-3 day learning phase impact
- Need gentler approach for future promotional switches
- ### Restructured Responsibilities
- Peter takes full control of:
- Budget pacing and technical strategy
- Account-level optimizations
- Copy and image implementation
- Company handles:
- Monthly budget allocation by region
- Asset briefs and creative direction
- Brand compliance and copy approval
- Front-end customer experience checks
- ### Countdown Timer for Black Friday
- Need wording for countdown timer
- Suggested: “Black Friday ends in…” (keep short due to variable expansion)
- Political preference to avoid “sale” terminology
- ### Christmas Asset Transition Strategy
- Switch from Black Friday to Christmas assets Tuesday morning
- Process refinement:
- Remove all Black Friday images first
- Add generic Christmas gifting images across all campaigns
- Manual implementation required for Performance Max asset groups
- Testing automated spreadsheet import system for future efficiency
- Priority: ensure no Black Friday content visible post-Monday
- ### Gift Promotion (8/12 to 14/12)
- 20% off selected gifts promotion
- Approach: minimal headline changes (3-4 headlines max) vs wholesale takeover
- Rely on merchant promotion extensions for visibility
- Avoid conversion rate drops seen with Black Friday’s extensive changes
- ### Sale Campaign Strategy (24/12 to 25/1)
- Three-phase approach planned:
- Up to 50% off launch (24th Dec)
- Further reductions (early Jan)
- 50% off + extra 10% with code (final week)
- Implementation strategy:
- Create separate sale asset groups alongside existing campaigns
- Replace only bottom 3-4 headlines in existing groups
- Use automated spreadsheet system if Tuesday test successful
- Timing: activate between 4-6pm Christmas Eve after stores close
- ### RSAs Post Black Friday
- Need to update Responsive Search Ads separately from Performance Max
- Focus on headline changes only, keep descriptions unchanged
- Promotion extensions will handle sale messaging below ads
- ### Last Order Dates
- Need country-specific last order dates for budget management
- Will use dates to automatically reduce spend on Christmas gift campaigns
- Expect 2-day spending hiatus (23rd-24th Dec) between last orders and sale launch
- ### Aspinall Competitor Targeting
- Political pressure to target Aspinall despite questionable ROI
- Previous spend: £313 for £7 return
- Compromise: £50/day budget on exact/phrase match “Aspinall” keywords until Monday
- Overlap rate increased from 15% to 75% year-on-year causing CPC inflation
- ### Next Steps
- Share Christmas asset folders via Google Drive today
- Provide last order dates before lunch
- Update gift promotion copy in shared spreadsheet Thursday next week
- Test automated asset import system before Tuesday
- Activate Aspinall competitor campaign at £50/day
- Discuss longer-term resource planning and New Year staffing approach

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Me: Lost all the dates. All right. Mate.
- Them: Mute again.
- Me: Hello.
- Them: Wish it would just. I wish it would just not have it as mute at the start.
- Me: Does it default to mute at the beginning?
- Them: By. Yeah, I thought it was. Normally when there was more than one other person in the room, it would default to mute.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But nevertheless.
- Me: I need it to make me a cup of tea when I start the meeting.
- Them: How are you? Yeah. Finished the one that I had on the train this morning, and then I try and leave it until 11 to go get another one. Tell you.
- Me: It's been a busy weekend.
- Them: Wow. What a week. What a week.
- Me: I wasn't expecting that, mate.
- Them: What a week. No. Well, I just said no, like I wasn't. Honestly, it's my choice, but. Yeah. So I had to make a decision.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Had to make it, take a decision and. I mean, in terms of. The sort of fit for this role that we need. You know, I, I, you know, we do desperately need someone who can kind of stand and learn two feet and confidently manage it. You know, I think you've had to do a lot more of the heavy lifting. Which is long term, not. Not what we want. And you know what? To be honest, I mean, I didn't necessarily share it all in this group that we had because I didn't want it to come across like I was sort of beating the stick in front of someone else.
- Me: I would keep your mad down as well. Mate.
- Them: Yeah, but the amount of stuff that I just think. That. Honestly, I've got three pages of. Things that just. And this is, like, fundamental hygiene stuff that I think, like, from when she joined. You'd thinking, right? First kind of couple of weeks, I'm going to get under the bonnet of everything and make sure that everything that's possibly going to be shown to a customer is accurate, you know? It's where it ought to be. There didn't seem to be. A kind of much organization from her end on, like things like Christmas launch. Or like it wasn't clear from what she was telling me that there was a plan. You know, this is the work we got to do. This is how we're splitting it. And even Black Friday as well. You know, I think we have the wrong promo dates. In because she assumed that because the financial period ends on Sunday, That the primary must end on Sunday as well.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But completely missing Cyber Monday.
- Me: Cyber Monday.
- Them: But there's never been any communication. So I checked. The Merchant sent the promos that you set up. Because I thought, well, if Lauren didn't know what the dates were, Did you know what the dates were? And they were fine. So I'm like, well, how have we got a site linked promo? Showing to customers at the promo ends on the 30th. And it's unfortunately, it's kind of like series of mistake after mistake, a mistake like that. That we were. We're spending the most important time of the year. Trying to fix those basic things rather than figuring out how do we kind of, you know, over perform.
- Me: Squeeze the nuts out of it.
- Them: Yeah. And I think you know the kind of. Especially with our team as well. It's like, and I think, to be honest, I mean, some of the feedback I've had from other people since yesterday is that they felt she struggled in the meetings in terms of, like, our team meetings on a Monday to try and explain how Pace Search was performing and, like, kind of almost any question from Seb. Just ended up with kind of like a deer in headlights. Look. So I think she relied a lot on you. But if. The thing was, you know, if it was that. If the goal was to have someone internally, then they can't rely on you like it should be. You're there as an expert, as a bit of guidance, you know, even in a kind of a mentor role. But ultimately, she needs to kind of be confident and know enough that she's. That she's driving it. So.
- Me: It's funny from my perspective. It's why I don't work for anyone. I'll be honest with you. It's why I don't work for anyone, because I just get on with it. I don't do committees. I don't do massive meetings. If I'm being trusted to look after an account, then I'm being trusted. I'll just do it. I don't need to have a couple of meetings to say, is that all right? It's like the Black Friday countdown timer asking you whether it's all right. Well, yeah. Okay. There's a process of. This is what I'm doing. You look at it and go, oh, by the way, don't put sale. Put this right. Okay. It's not. Is it okay if I do? This. I've just sent it to this person, this person, this person, this person. And then waiting a week for it to come back, because that will happen.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: We're on the leading edge of this right now.
- Them: No, to be honest, that's. That's a good point. I mean. Because when I'm being asked, is it okay to do it? Well, I don't know. Is that okay? I mean, if you said to me, this is what we're doing, Can you just make sure you're happy with the words?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay, cool. I wouldn't even think to question whether it's a good or bad idea. I just trust it's a good idea and it's going to make more money. But when it's like, You know, because I don't. Yeah, Like, I struggled a bit with that conversation. It was like. She seemed kind of very unsure. It even went to start it. And it's like. But I need you to kind of have. You need to back your own decisions, you know, just make a decision. Otherwise, I'm kind of sat there thinking, well, I don't even know if we should be doing it because we don't even know when we should be starting it or. Do we even bother? So. Yeah, I mean, that and that kind of indecision. Sort of means, then I spend more time. Just checking. And then the problem is, then you start checking, then you start finding bits and you're thinking, well, you know. And I know it's not. It's not necessarily a fair way of looking at the world, but I think, right, you're here for 40 hours a week. The only thing I need you to do is just. You've got Peter support, but just keep on top of these accounts, make sure that everything's. Optimized. That's it. I don't need to do anything else. I don't want you to try and help on paid social or help anyone else or do anything other than just focus solely. Just do the best you can in that area. But. Yeah, so it's. Yeah, it's a horrible decision to have to make, but. I think it was the right one. I don't think she was likely to kind of come on leaps and bounds. I think she was feeling the pressure. Quite a lot.
- Me: The problem is agency side. You're getting fed bits and pieces when.
- Them: And then I think, Yeah.
- Me: You're actually responsible for everything you need to know everything.
- Them: Yeah. And she did mention that, you know, into HR yesterday, that she was used to having someone like an exec to kind of do the doing. But. But then we made that so clear when we put this role out. Yeah. And we kind of, you know, we made it so clear when we put this role out that, like, you have to be the internal page charts expert. Like, you have to be willing to do the doing, but also be involved in the thinking. So, yeah, we really kind of handed that. And. Yeah. Yeah. So difficult choice, but then, you know. The easy thing would be to try and look, overlook everything, and then just spend the rest of my life trying to convince myself and Seb that it's all fine. Or, you know, constantly covering. And I don't think it would have worked out. I wouldn't have had confidence at the end of January, if you were to go and she was to be managing all this all by herself. I wouldn't have the confidence that things would be. Getting handled. Because even though the stuff you sent over yesterday. It would probably take two weeks for me to get that. From Lauren, respectfully. Whereas that. It's like, you know what? It's like when you got kind of like, you know, Paolo's asking seven and then seven then asking me, and it's because he needs it for a bought meeting on Thursday. And it's like, well, I need answers. Like, they don't have to. Be kind of 100% correct, but it's just got to be kind of close enough to.
- Me: Apologies to that. That was quite embarrassing, that, and I'm glad you checked it because. And it was obvious at the end, there's either account level starts for certain things and there's campaign level stats because like US UK business with the conversion action, sometimes it has to drop back to campaign.
- Them: Y. Es.
- Me: And for some reason, it did.
- Them: But that second set of numbers that, because I looked at the first set at 185 or 1, 95 for the UK, I thought that looks like almost looks too far away from the double counted number. But the two A8, actually, even though I didn't know of that by that point, I didn't know which one to go for, but the 288 felt like. Just felt a bit closer to where it was. And that's all we need to kind of get to is go right.
- Me: Yeah, yeah.
- Them: You know, brand revenue in the UK hasn't actually cut in half. That's not true, because when you strip out the double counting, it's actually a lot closer. Or actually it's slightly under. We're slightly up, sorry, this year. And it just tells a completely different story.
- Me: There's a different level of positivity in those numbers. The fact the brand non brand has been increased.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, it's. It's. And you are likely to be getting more new customers. Is that. Is that being reflected in the numbers or not?
- Them: Yeah, we saw that for last week, so I think I'll just pull it up quick. So we had. Bear with me. Your second weekly reports. So for last week. I will click on the right report. Here we go. So. Yeah, so we had just under 1, 500 people shop online last week and. The. Oh, the first. Hang on. 37% of people last week were new.
- Me: Wow. Wow, wow, wow.
- Them: So that is that.
- Me: It's such a strong brand. That's pretty impressive, isn't it?
- Them: Is. Yeah. So I'll show you. Let me just see if you can. I can share this with you. I'm not sure if it's going to.
- Me: Who don't want to pay for it.
- Them: No, no, that's it. So, yeah, we had just under 2,600 customers shopped last week, so that's up 76% on the previous week. 961 of them, so 37% of them were brand new.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: Which is up 2%. On last year.
- Me: Very good.
- Them: So that's. Yeah, so that's pretty good. So the number, and the big one is, you know, the number of people that have shopped in the last 12 months, and that's only 4% below last year now. I got one point that was kind of like 10% below.
- Me: Right.
- Them: And that's. That's just website numbers. And then what's been more encouraging? Which I'm keen for us to take as much credit as possible is the numbers for the first two days of this week.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So.
- Me: Is that what you sent through this morning?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. So for Monday, we were 9% up on forecast, plus 10 to last year and then plus 14, like for like. And then yesterday, which is the one I sent this morning, we were plus 19 first, our forecast, plus 21 to the year and plus 23 like for like, so.
- Me: Great.
- Them: That's strong. That's really strong. That's really kind of clawing back. The problem is we don't get consistent performance like that. So I'll be really intrigued to see. How the rest of this week goes.
- Me: Well, we're black Friday week, aren't we? So. The bloody dashboard's gone down this morning. I'll get. I'll get the numbers updated. That dashboard, which I've created. In fact, let me. Let me kick it off now. We should have that at the end because it's giving us a kind of prediction. It's all fingering the air job, this.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: My concern is we spent too much money too soon. You know that? Should we should have just. Held on until this week before going full on with it. But depending on what time of day I run the prediction, depends on whether we're going to smash the target. Well, just beat the target or be about 200 grand below it. So which will be, you know, it's. When you looked at those figures for the revenue figures against last year, you could see it peaking now.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, it was it last year, it was fairly flat, and then it started to go up. It's going to be fascinating to see what happens. I can't wait until and I'm hoping still around at this time, it's I can't wait till May so that when we're doing year on year comparisons. We can actually do year on year comparisons, Right. Pissing about with the conversion action on it that will make things so much easier. So.
- Them: Yes. Yeah. Then it really is, like, for, like. Because it's just a nightmare to try and look at at a minute.
- Me: Yes. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
- Them: So I had a couple of bits just to cover this morning. Probably mainly just in kind of rebalancing. Kind of between us, who's doing what. I. I expect it'll probably go back to what we did over the summer. As in, you know, I. I can communicate all of the budgets per month.
- Me: Great.
- Them: And then happy for you to kind of chop those up performance wise how you want to between uk, us, Roan, eu, but I can give you the top line number.
- Me: There's going to be more in Europe. I think the latest budget pushed a bit more towards Europe because it's doing well and rest of the world because there was nothing there last year. It's low hanging fruit that, you know, it's a lot of brown in.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: One thing.
- Them: Yeah. So I'll definitely. I'll keep sending those over to you, and then I won't. Get involved in kind of. Who, What. Where's the account necessarily? Because I think that'll end up being a pain in the ass for you. I'm going in there adjusting stuff, and then you're going in there and going, I didn't bloody do that.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: So I'll leave that to you. The only things I'll do is.
- Me: I'll know. I will.
- Them: Just be kind of checking over from a copy and a creative point of view that it's. Yeah.
- Me: I'll paint it at another pair of eyes, mate, I. I don't take exception to it at all. People looking at it like that. If you see something it's not right, you tell me and I'll. And I'll get it sorted. But just tell me you don't need to change. It yourself. Just say what about such and such a thing.
- Them: Right. Cool.
- Me: Because I do. I. I can't look at everything. This is huge. It is absolutely huge.
- Them: Oh, yes, I'm happy. I will just do my kind of just sanity checks. These are the campaigns that are on. These are the headlines that are shown to customers. You know, are we from a brand perspective? Are we missing anything? Is there any more new information or new. Bits that we should consider and then I'll ping them over. But, yeah, so in terms of, like, eyes on, if you handle the pacing and the technical and the strategy side, we'll work on that.
- Me: And the copy and the images.
- Them: Yeah. Then I'm. I'm. I'm happy to keep an eye on. What's coming up in terms of. I'll do all the asset briefs and stuff, so. And get those all delivered over. And then I will just keep an eye on from a. More from like a front end, what the customer might and might not be seeing. And just make sure that if there's any tweaks we need to be doing,
- Me: Great.
- Them: Then.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I can throw in that over, but. Yeah, I guess I just want to be able to let you do your thing that you're good at rather than having to.
- Me: Well, I mean, the thing is. I mean, I'm on the. I'm on the back foot. Without a shadow of a doubt, because I have no idea. Well, I have a rough idea what the plan was. I'm kind of ready for the asset changes on Tuesday. The issue I'm going to have is images. Those the images per campaign. I have not got a clue what's going to go where, and that's going to be pain in the ass because I can't necessarily do that. Programmatically, it's going to be a case of going into the individual asset groups and picking what images to use. And it's funny, last year I picked one images to use and nobody complained. I know we need to be put in the right thing out for the business, but, you know, it was a case just get. For me, it's about getting images in there. First and foremost for quality scoring the account because it likes images and secondly, it's making sure that the right images because I, I know they make most of the time and make diddly shit difference to whether it's going to convert or not, especially on the pmax. It does. You know, there's a huge amount of importance attached to the images because of brand, but in terms of actual performance,
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's. It. It's minimal in the mix. It's very minimal. But I will have to work through those manual, I think.
- Them: And is there any way, is there anything I can be doing between now and then to just support that? Just thinking out loud, really? Like, is there anything you can give me and say, look. What are we putting these?
- Me: Well.
- Them: Or would you prefer that I'm just sort of doing checks once you're doing stuff?
- Me: I think it's just doing checks. I mean, there's a certain amount of knowledge is required on the Google Ads interface to see what images are going where.
- Them: Y.
- Me: And it has to be down into the asset because I have to drill down to the asset group, see what's there, get rid of all the Black Friday ones. I can't do that. Carte blanche. What I might do.
- Them: Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: What I might do on Tuesday morning. First thing is just get rid of all the Black Friday images. And then start to add the images back in again. In terms of priority.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I think. Image. Image and text. If we just.
- Me: That was Lauren's favorite phrase. That makes sense. And you just look at it go. It doesn't, does it?
- Them: What? Oh, no.
- Me: I shouldn't take the mic.
- Them: Don't. No, I think if we just purge. The most important thing is that on Tuesday morning, any. Sniff of Black Friday is perched from these accounts.
- Me: Yeah, that's going to be the hard. One.
- Them: And then. A case of just adding in the. Christmas gift in. I need to check what you have. I don't know if I can see what.
- Me: I mean, the thing is, if this, if they. If there are generic Christmas images.
- Them: Was.
- Me: Christmas gift images I can drop into everything. That'll be awesome. Because then I can just go through and just blast it. I can just.
- Them: Shall I just find the flipping folder that they chuck it all in and just. I'll go and I'll send them over. Just so you've got a visual reference of, like, all of these are absolutely fine to be chucked in.
- Me: It took him anywhere.
- Them: Yeah, and it's like generic gifting.
- Me: Yeah, that would be awesome.
- Them: How. How are we going to work it from a. Structure point of view. So for P Max, will it just be. Generic Christmas gifting. Because then that would make sense. We could just chuck all of the generic Christmas gift in, and then we'll go what category level with RSAs.
- Me: I'm only saying. Yeah, I mean. Well, the RSA is no images. So are those. So the asset groups say for like the leather bags, both as a Christmas gifting image. That's fine.
- Them: Or you just. No, no, no. No, that's fine.
- Me: That's not a problem. It doesn't have to be a picture of a bag. You know, so if we can, if they. If there are a number of Christmas gifting images.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That you could show me. Then I can identify where they sit in Google Ads and prepare things. And it's going to be mentally, because I'm going to have to do it. I'm going to have to do it in a, on a, on a manual basis. I will just go in and swap all those out for the, for the. The Black Friday ones and do that first thing on on Tuesday. I'll have an early start or something on Tuesday and try and get them done before 9:00.
- Them: Okay? I'll find. I'll get them to resend me the folder with all of the P. Max Christmas stuff that we had pre Black Friday. And then what I'll probably do is. Have you got access to any folders and assets? How did Lauren normally give them to you?
- Me: All over the show. I, I, I don't know. I don't know.
- Them: Okay? Well, I do have a Google Drive folder, and I can say I can follow them. Christmas. Pmax gifting. Generic gift in. Everything in here is generic gifting. Do what you want with it.
- Me: Go. That's all I want.
- Them: These images. I only want them on. Bags.
- Me: Y.
- Them: For example, I'll just folder in Google Drive show you the folder link.
- Me: Eah. You make it as simple as you possibly can for me.
- Them: And then. Yeah.
- Me: That would be great.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: And then what I'll do then is I'll change. I'll. I'll swap out the Black Friday ones first. For the, for the generic gifting. And then if there's any additional ones you want for specific asset groups, then I can add those in afterwards. But the priorities to get the Christmas gifts.
- Them: Yeah. And I will just. I'll say these can be used for this. Whether you actually have an asset group, live for it.
- Me: Fantastic.
- Them: Fine, doesn't matter. But if you did, it's there. If you wanted to make one, that's there. If you don't need to use it, don't use it. So, okay, so I'll do that. From an asset point, from a creative imagery point of view, that's fine. And I'LL share that with you today.
- Me: Yeah. Brilliant. Wonderful. Yeah.
- Them: Let's just talk about. Headlines and descriptions for a minute, so. Did we before we change to from Christmas to Black Friday, did we save down.
- Me: Yep, got them all.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: Thankfully.
- Them: Is there anything on there? That you think I need to have a look at? Because I know we made lots of, like, can we change this to this? Or this wasn't. The free delivery threshold was wrong. Is there anything. You can share over with me and I'll just go for a review and change just so that we're not putting back anyone. So like anything that we've any business as usual headlines and descriptions that we've corrected over this period.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: We're not then going to put. The outdated ones back in.
- Me: Y. Ep. Now. That's the folder. That's the g sheet. Just give you. Editor.
- Them: There.
- Me: So that that workbook has got us ad copy, uk, Europe and rest of world.
- Them: Okay, perfect. So I'll just scan it and if there's any. Things that are factually out of date, I will just create it. And I guess then that's your. That's your kind of, like, copy bank, is it? For want of a better word.
- Me: That. That. That structure in there is brilliant for me. I've got something that works on that.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So any copy going forward. I know you've got your own version of the copy, but that. Is is more workable for me than what we have at the moment. I find the one we've got at the moment is a bit all over the show, and I know that's because it's marketing need to look at it and approve and all the rest of it, but.
- Them: Yeah, it just serves a different purpose, that's all.
- Me: It does. It does. But for me, that I can take that I've written something. That takes that and puts it in.
- Them: Right, okay. Fine. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
- Me: So it makes it easy for me to see it that way. But bear that in. Bear in mind, having said that, that is what will go in. Yeah. So if you have a little bit of a Tourette's moment on one of those boxes, then that's what will get loaded up. So there's no. There's no double check on it. That's raw data. That. That's the stuff that I use.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: So just handle with care.
- Them: Yeah. That's fine. That's fine. Okay, and then the last. The second question on copy. So the next sort of marketing activation is this 20 off selected GIFs.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: That's from the 8th of December till the 14th. Now that the theme around that, I mean, that's literally this idea was born at like 4:00 yesterday afternoon. It is sticking with the Christmas gifting theme. But 20 selected amount of our Christmas gifts. We'll have 20 off. So. What I was saying yesterday was, I think. We could probably just drop in headlines and descriptions to. Because they'll complement the Christmas messaging anyway, because it's Christmas gift in promo. I don't want to do a takeover like Black Friday. It's not that kind of thing. It's more. Here's half a dozen headlines. And half a dozen descriptions. Put them, sprinkle them where they need to be sprinkled. So that, you know, customers see them. But we're not kind of wholesale changing anything.
- Me: Did you see that? Just. Just on that point, then, did you see that the conversion rate graphs are sent over to Lauren yesterday? And we saw.
- Them: For the headlines.
- Me: No, it was the conversion rates.
- Them: You send out an email on the teams group.
- Me: No, I think you sent it on teams. Oh, it was. It was partly to do with the search impression share as well.
- Them: Oh, was that around the. I saw something.
- Me: Let me just share my screen with you.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Rather than me trying to guess what.
- Me: This is. It's. Yeah. Oh, I can visualize it now. So this is conversion rate year on year.
- Them: Y.
- Me: And it's really quite interesting to see, like, the uk, what happened then. The UK. This just freak you out completely for 2025? We see that big drop here. We see another one for the US there. Not as noticeable for Europe, but those two there. That's when we changed the asset groups. That's when we did that massive change.
- Them: Okay. So is that. Yeah.
- Me: Yeah. So this is what I was warning about prior to Christmas and about the stats through about what was the impact of going to Black Friday. Wholesale. That's the impact. So we see this and we go, oh, that's amazing, isn't it? Look at it. It's the conversion rate here, but how much did that cost? There for that to drop down and come back up again. It takes two or three days every time for the. So it goes into sort of like a mini learning phase.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: When you change that much stuff because it has to reassess what it is. So the idea when we go into sale of let's just take it easy.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And let's just change a headline. And rely on merchant promoter. The merchant extension. Promotion Extensions. Can I get it right? Promotion extensions within the search ads. So that's where you get an extra little bit of text underneath the ad and then within the shopping ads, which is the majority of your. Your generic traffic.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It will have a strike, say it's a sale, so. That's the difference.
- Them: So how do we.
- Me: Between them.
- Them: How do we. I don't know if this is a process thing, but how do we find the balance between. And it only happens. There's only Black Friday in Sale where this happens. And it's like, well. It's a bit like, obviously, when the window changes on Christmas and then all the red banners come down for sale.
- Me: Absolutely.
- Them: Like we. We need to have. Just kind of figure out the best way to. We need to have maximum visibility for sale from the 24th.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: How do we achieve that? Without chopping the head off. Conversion rate. Is it like you say, launching with. You know, obviously, the merchant center promotion and two to three headlines, and then can we drop in? Can we. Can we just increase it every day, the visibility?
- Me: I think.
- Them: Rather than dropping everything in on launch day. Launch night.
- Me: If you think what happens? We get these 15 headlines to get dropped in. So, like, the majority of them, pretty much. Well, pretty much all of them were changed. So it's going to go Shit. I don't know what to do here.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: If you actually just went in and did three or four.
- Them: Okay, that's that. That'll be happy with.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: Because there's. There's only three or four ways to say up to 50% off.
- Me: There's only so many ways to say Black Friday. We still managed 15. Yeah. So we've got to be careful with that, actually. And those stats are sent over about the performance of the headlines over. Over this last seven days, this short period of time. There's a lot of traffic has been that it's the promo ones that work the best. Now. Promo ones work the best. I think click through rate and conversion rates were the best. So what Google's going to do is it's going to go well. I'm going to show them then.
- Them: Yeah. Y.
- Me: Yeah. So it's going to do it anyway. It's going to. It's going to. It's going to promote those anyway. You can have an asset group, which is sale.
- Them: Eah.
- Me: So the sale one gets set up alongside what you've already got. Never stop what we've already got. Apart from Christmas. But that's a whole campaign. But you set up the sale asset group. And the audiences that it's promoting are people who are interested in a sale. So the search themes within there will be about a sale. So that's specifically people looking for a sale and you drop that in alongside what we've already got. So there'll be the duplication. It doesn't matter. With asset groups, all the asset group is a different view on a different group of products so you can have the same products in the same thing. So you drop that in there.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: On everywhere. You have an account level promotion extension.
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: The sale one will be very in your face. This is a sale. Whereas the ones that, the existing ones will have two or three headlines that you will change and we can just drop them at the bottom of the. Of the headlines. Just replace the bottom three headlines we've already got in the R6 groups with sale. Google go. Oh, what's that? Oh, new shiny thing. Let's go and have a look at that. They'll put it up there. And if it's a sale. You might find them. Immediately, people start increasing, they click through, rate will start to go up and so therefore it will then show more.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Then at the end of it, we swap those out to what they were previously. And happy days.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, well, I'm happy. I'm happy with us. Magic. I think maybe it's. An educational piece for the people here as well, and just in terms of, you know, because.
- Me: Very much.
- Them: Especially when you kind of see the data. I'd be really interested. I know it's not. Apples and apples, but. We did what we did on Black Friday. Fine. We now managed to sail the way you've just described, so I'm happy with that. Because I haven't got 50. I don't need to put 15 headlines in. We've got. Like you say, for example, being extreme. You've got 10 business as usual, Christmas gifting. Christmas. Well, not Christmas gifted by them, but, you know, autumn, wintery Christmas, lovely business as usual stuff. And then five sale ones.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And then off you go.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I would be interested post sale as much as we can to kind of see. How we've not necessarily damaged conversion rates with the asset changes because we're doing a lot less asset changes, therefore, because that'd be a really good piece to kind of show the business to say, look. We're managing it this way. There's actually, you know. A lot less detrimental effects. Than what we did this time. So, yeah, I mean, that's absolutely fine. And I think.
- Me: This is huge analysis piece on that. It'd be. It'd be fascinating to see. And the actual impact of the. Of the gifting one for Christmas. If we get it wrong, it's less impact than the Black Friday one.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But then we. We. I'll take both of those and go. This is what happened at that time. Let's do this big dobber of an analysis and say what was the right approach. And then come up with a. With a. A formula, if you like, for the. For the future. So I'm supposing this is what will happen. You know, that, that, that. And we can see from that conversion rate depth that that's what happened with the Black Friday. But will the same thing happen with the change in the not changing as many headlines in the asset groups? I actually don't know. But based upon best practices. And what Google have been saying, you don't do that, you just do a few of them.
- Them: Yeah. And I. I agree. Yeah.
- Me: It all makes sense. The logic is there. So it's. Whether it appears in practice or not is a different matter, but.
- Them: Well, you've got. You've got the data for Black Friday. I mean, that's.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Quite. You know, it's difficult to argue with that.
- Me: Y.
- Them: Okay, so.
- Me: What date is that? The sale.
- Them: 24th is when it starts. So as a christmas eve one. And it not we have to normally wait until. So we'll figure out process wise, kind of, you know, how much you want to throw to me to just kind of click go, but it's normally like, When the last store shuts, we can then press go on the sale.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So even if you've got everything set up, I'll be working. Until Sal goes live anyway. So even if you just want to give me.
- Me: Is that 5:00?
- Them: Go through and. It's between 4 and 6 on Christmas Eve. So we try and finish early on Christmas Eve. Because it's Christmas Eve. But we just literally just sat by. Sat by desks at home, waiting for the store to shut. And then you can go. Yeah, normally. Or at least half waiting to just press go.
- Me: Right.
- Them: And then we press go and everything between four and six.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But. By all means. If you can get it to a place where we're ready. And you just need me to go. In, enable some asset groups or whatever.
- Me: I don't know. I don't. I don't. I don't think there's anything I could give you to press a button on.
- Them: Is it something that can be scheduled if we closer to the time new right? It's going live.
- Me: Well, we're swapping out. You see, that's the problem. We're swapping out. We're swapping out. Asset groups are really weird. You can't. As you keep your asset group as it is, because that's where the history is. I know what you do. We're swapping out text, we're swapping out images.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: It's not as easy to do that as if you had an RSA or something, like a text ad where you could just run it in parallel with it and just flick it over. Or say now on pause. Pause that one. Make that one live. You can't do that with Mass. You got to physically go in and do it.
- Them: Yes. I mean, I'm familiar with. Going into asset groups.
- Me: Yeah. Be it up to go into every single asset group in all four accounts and shake if it had lines.
- Them: If I. If I. If I had to, then that's an option. You know, if you were. If. If you were to. If you could provide me with the ones you want. Updating.
- Me: It is a massive job. I could probably if based upon what happens with this the flick over from Black Friday to Christmas. This spreadsheet that I've just shared with you is our master spreadsheet. Okay? Of assets. If this. If this switchover works well. Then I'm going to use this spreadsheet as our spreadsheet for going forward, so we can actually change it on here. And then I can just run something. And it will just import all those and replace what we've already got.
- Them: Right.
- Me: So I'm going to use the learnings from this. For the 24th.
- Them: Okay? Okay?
- Me: Because that's a bit more critical. If it. If this goes. If this goes tits up on Tuesday and doesn't run through, there's no reason I've. I've done that many dry runs of it and I've used another client to try it on as well in. In real life, so. If this. If this works, it just means on the 24, I just have to give it a command here, and it will pull in whatever's in that spreadsheet. So we save that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Then. It should be fine. You know, so we can. I can just go in and go, well, let's change these headlines, you know, 13, 14, 15 will change into this. Or let's change the Christmas ones to the. The. The. The new version for gifting, and then it will just suck it in. And.
- Them: Right. So in theory, you could.
- Me: Then.
- Them: Upload all of these. Just, you know, you're not. Yes, I'm not. On Christmas Eve. If we said right. Half past four. Go, go, go.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Do that. All your changes happen, and then we're good.
- Me: Yeah. All the text will go in. I'm going to experiment with images, see whether there's anything we do with that. I don't think we can. I don't think there's anything we can do with images because it. They're held in a very strange way within Google Ads, you know? It's like image id. It's not obvious what it is. And you can't pull the. The URL of the image and show the image in the. In the spread I'm getting very technically. But you can't show it in the G sheet, so you have to know what it is.
- Them: Yeah. So you can't put right. Okay, so you can't just have a column for image URL, and then you've got the path. Okay. We're not going to have a huge amount because again, it's going to be a graphic. It's going to be image wise. It'll be similar to Black Friday.
- Me: And how gonna last for.
- Them: In terms of. That will go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I've got it for five weeks at the minute, so until almost the last week of January.
- Me: Okay? See if I put the 28th or something.
- Them: Go for. 25th. So the 24th of December to the 25th. Of jan. The added complexity, which isn't a problem today. Is there'll be three phases to this. Sale.
- Me: Woohoo.
- Them: Which will just record, say, just require just copy and possibly an image. Replacement. And that is so you've got up to 50% off launch on the 24th. Then I suspect in the first week of Jan. Ten days into Jan, it will change to further reductions. Tbc. Whether we update assets for that I'm not sure yet, but then the last week or so. Will be up to 50% off, plus an extra 10% with this code.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So there will likely be three phases again. But I'd say we are a little bit off getting. Confirmation. I'm going to prep copy briefs. And asset briefs based on that happening, and then it'll either be there to use or not.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: One just question on this GIFS thing in terms of process and what's the best way for us to work. The paid media ad copy Google sheet. That I currently.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Use to put in the headlines and descriptions. Now. Does it make sense that I only add the descriptions in here? That should be added rather than trying to have everything in here. You've already got it in your sheet.
- Me: No, I'm not with you.
- Them: So bear with. So I'm just going to share. Can you see that?
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Okay, so 20 off gifs, live day, end date. Fine. Normally these headlines are full. With all of the BAU stuff, and then someone would drop in a few 20% off gift headlines.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Would you prefer that I only kept in this headlines the stuff that needs to be that is related to the thing we're talking about? So if I just put in three headlines for 20% off GIFs.
- Me: Do you know what I really like?
- Them: And then. Gone.
- Me: Is for you not to use, not for me not to not look at that spreadsheet at all. For me to just be using for you to be going into, because I trust you now, is for you to be going into that one. That would be the ideal situation for me.
- Them: How would be the best way for me to know where you want. Where you might want those. Headlines. Or descriptions to go. Or is that a.
- Me: It doesn't matter.
- Them: Moot point.
- Me: Yeah, it doesn't matter. 1. One thing that you're going to notice when I do this swap over the of the assets is that you might not have in headline one smice in a Bond Street. At the top. It might be shop bags, stationary and more. And that again, going to be an educational piece. Just because it's in position one doesn't mean that's the priority at all. There is no priority in.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: There.
- Them: And how do we know what's the easiest way for me to kind of know what you've got? What should be updated then. Okay, so if I was to. If I keep my sheet just as a. Because that's what we're using internally.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So I will probably only just put in the headlines and the descriptions that relate to the proceed in this case 29 gives because then I know I've only got to put these into your sheet.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: When I'm now looking at so pretend I've got those. I'm now looking at your sheet and I'm going to update the uk. I copy headlines.
- Me: It's not easy.
- Them: Is there a way for me to know what we've currently got live so that I'm not? Because, for example, there's stuff down towards the bottom that rows 28, 29 to 35 that like references. Spring Summer 24.
- Me: Yeah, they could come out. Sorry. I didn't realize.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That.
- Them: No, no, that's fine, but it's just so that I don't go through and update everything. Is there a way where you could say, look, just like, update the ones that are in bold?
- Me: Just.
- Them: Because those are the ones that we're using.
- Me: I've just got rid of the I've just got rid of the ones that were not using.
- Them: Okay, cool. So if I was once. I've got my copy for the gifts.
- Me: I will update that. Mate. I will go in and update that. I didn't realize. Lauren's got this together based upon some stuff I sent over to her.
- Them: Right.
- Me: So I'm not. Let me do a clean on this. I'll clean the fire. I'll clean it up. And everything that's in there is live.
- Them: Okay, that's. That's helpful. And then I will only update. I will have to. I presume I will need to say to you. Right. Peter, I'm ready to put the new headlines in. Just to make sure that that's not going to be sucked up.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, for example. I obviously wouldn't put anything to do with 20 off gifts in here. Now, until we've we're post Black Friday.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, for example, the promo starts on the 8th, so I might put these. In. On the fourth or fifth next week. And then I'll send you a message. Say, look, all you have 20% off gifts, headlines and descriptions are now in.
- Me: The 8th, I think with 24th. Oh, for the gifting one.
- Them: Sorry, we're on the. Yeah.
- Me: Yep. Sorry.
- Them: Yeah, I'm just thinking process wise. I think we need to. Obviously, I need to be clear with you that when I'm making actions to the sheet,
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So that you don't do an update. And accidentally pull in half of the 20% off gift stuff, because I haven't told you that.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I'm putting it in. So.
- Me: See, once I've run this. So this. This will get run on Tuesday and all these headlines and descriptions will get sucked in.
- Them: Yes. So I obviously won't do anything for the next promo until after we're back to normal.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: At which point. I'll let you know that I'm updating it, and I'll let you know when it's updated.
- Me: Yeah. So I know it's not ideal this, but I like this. Will get.
- Them: But if the process is clear, it's. It's fine. Yeah, I mean, I don't. I don't mind.
- Me: The only concern is that, you know, you. The unbeknownst to you, you're going to be changing stuff that's working really well. I. I don't have time to. To accommodate that at all.
- Them: Well, I'm. I'm going to have to do it just based on taking stuff out that's just not appropriate.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So. Yeah. So if we do.
- Me: Exploring it. Take it out. Weird. But, yeah, it's. You know, I think. I think you know enough about it to. To be able to say. You know, a modern take on an icon isn't the best, but.
- Them: No. So, I mean, that's not going to affect performance. Yeah. So I'll look at it anyway. And based on. Based on the asset group itself. I'll have a good idea. If there's any that look quite similar, that actually, I can replace that. So I won't just replace the first three headlines every time. I'll go through and look at all the headlines of which are the most appropriate ones to change.
- Me: Yeah. And it's more likely to be the ones towards the back.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: That. Are, you know, from a. From a legacy viewpoint, because I think people just got tired by the time they got there and just whack any old thing.
- Them: No, that's. Yeah, just to try and get the score up.
- Me: You know, this is. Yeah. And this is a big piece. To do in years to just. Just to do that optimization, see what works and what doesn't work.
- Them: Okay? That's okay. That. No, that's absolutely fine. So I'm happy to do that. So I'll manage the internal sheet. And then I will. Just because I'll use that internally to show separate this. Is how we're going to be.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Talking.
- Me: And then we can work on this. You know, we can. We can work on this after. After Christmas. And just get this into. Into a place where, you know, you can change stuff in here.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it's going to get implemented, but I can also add my influence to it.
- Them: Y.
- Me: You know, and I would suggest. Well, I mean, the sale ones are fine. I mean, it's just, you know, up to half selected items. You just. No need to do it.
- Them: Es.
- Me: You know, don't go over 30 characters on the headlines. The. The rest of it is, you know, it's. It isn't really rocket science when you're doing a.
- Them: No, no, it's fine. And that. I mean, that's what I'm. I like money. All. Pay me a sheet because I've got my. Formula in there to tell me when I've gone over. And to be honest, 30 characters is not bloody long either. Like, the amount of times I'm on 31, I think.
- Me: Life.
- Them: By sake. Okay, well, I think process wise, we're in a good spot then. So I've got some actions on assets. Quite some actions on copy. That's all fine.
- Me: Okay? I've got some further testing to do on this this week, just to make sure it will actually pull it in on Tuesday. Because that'll be a pain in the ass if it doesn't. I've got all sorts of backups to. To. To go.
- Them: No, that's right. I think that's the, that's the priority. That would be the next priority, obviously, trading through this week and then the switch over from the second and then just in terms of.
- Me: There's also the rsas to do as well.
- Them: Oh, yeah, I do like an rsa because I get more control.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I enjoy every control over stuff.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So.
- Me: The rs. The RSA isn't in that list. It's just the assets. I'm going to have to. I'm going to have to think about that as well. Is how we're going to change the RSAs. This is where the customizers came in really nicely.
- Them: Yeah. Because on my paid media copy thing I have got a section where I will fill in an RSA. Ad for copy for UK and one for US. For example, for this 20 off gifts. So I guess for the promos, you're not going to put low again. We're not going to fill it up with. It's just putting a one description, one headline.
- Me: I wouldn't even change the descriptions. It's. It is a headliner sale. It's just bang, you know, people aren't going to pass that point. And if he's got underneath, the description will be the. The promotion extension anyway.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Pushing it.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: But if you've got some. If you've got some wording on the sale, that'd be great, because then I can. I can schedule in the promotion extension to start next, you say the 8th?
- Them: Eighth to the fourteenth. Yeah, and I'll have a code as well, but I just need it confirmed. That should be confirmed this week.
- Me: Okay? So the countdown timer for Black Friday. Just a wording on that, then.
- Them: Right. Yes, I meant to ask. Because I.
- Me: No worries. Or you just ping that over whenever and I'll get that set up.
- Them: I'll have to check. Yeah, because that was the one where she suggested the headline. It was like, sale ends six days or something, wasn't it? And I said we need to not call it sale, because we don't.
- Me: Yeah. And it's just. I don't know. It's Black Friday promotion. Plug. And you. You. You're quite limited. I can't tell you. I can't actually tell you what sort of length that's going to have to be because. It's a. It's a variable, the countdown bit. So just make it as short as you can. I'll put it in and see what it works. Now if it doesn't fit, then I'll let you know, but after I put it into Google Ads to find out whether it's happy with it or not. Because it has to bear in mind how much it's going to expand out because it might be like, sale ends in 23 minutes. Towards the end.
- Them: All right. Okay. Yeah. So at the minute, it's quite short because it's just four days, and then when it gets into.
- Me: This is not. It'll be that accurate.
- Them: Six hours. Right. It's going to end up being. I'll confirm on teams in a minute, but it'll end up being something like.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Black Friday ends.
- Me: Great. That's the kind of thing.
- Them: Black black Friday ends in.
- Me: Y.
- Them: I mean, because any more than that, you're in danger of running over on the final day anyway, so.
- Me: Eah. Yes, you are. But, I mean, sale is great because there's only four letters, but, you know, if that's. If that can't be, then that can't be.
- Them: It's only because. Yeah, it's only good. It's more of a political thing.
- Me: Yeah, no problem.
- Them: Internally.
- Me: Because. United discount site, that's why.
- Them: Exactly. Exactly. Despite. Despite the messaging.
- Me: All the time.
- Them: And then I've got one final, final, final thing which you won't like, but I think Seb has given me a bit of a JFDI on it. He would like. 3aspinall targeting. He wants us to do it. I think if we just spent 50 quid a day until Monday.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Just to show that it's. It's just because I keep talking to him about it internally.
- Me: It's spaffed a load of money away already and it's, doesn't it?
- Them: No, no, I know.
- Me: I think the thing I disagree with is where it was said that let's do this because it'll force them to back off a little bit. It won't have any effect whatsoever.
- Them: I know. Yeah. And that almost. Almost. That's almost a quote. That I put in there.
- Me: Really? Well, the. The. The thing that. The thing that we sent over yesterday about Black, about that. And the fact the reason you had an impression sharedrop on brands. Last week is because Lawrence took the budget down from 800 quid to 200 quid. That's why she did it. But. Excuse my French, but. She. She took it down from 800 quid to 200 quid. So it was. The reason was budget. Nothing else at all. We're back up to 98 impression share now.
- Them: Yeah, I think it's the overlap rate is the issue as well. So last year,
- Me: Yeah, but they will. They will do it.
- Them: Well, last year it was only 15% at this time of the year. Now we're I think last seven days last year was 15. Now it's at 75.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, well, that's.
- Them: So they've made a conscious.
- Me: That's up to them.
- Them: So.
- Me: Influence that at all.
- Them: Oh, no, no, no, no. I know. Apart from, you know. But again, I think this is more of a political decision from.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Our, you know, Paolo. So whoever obviously pissed off that it's happening. And want us.
- Me: How are they measuring what impact that has, though?
- Them: I suppose he's looking at from a what's the impact?
- Me: He's going on sorrow.
- Them: Well, that, but also what's the impact on CPCs? Because obviously CPCs for brand seem to have jumped up quite a bit.
- Me: Nothing. Perhaps nothing to do with Aspinall's. Well, it will be to do with Aspinall's, but that's up to them. You know, they quadrupled the CPC's year on year. That's why the brand is so inefficient.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: In their roas. But we can't. We can't change that CPC by going and bidding on someone else's brown. The two things are disconnected completely.
- Them: No, I know, I know, I know.
- Me: Sorry. I'm just. I'm just.
- Them: No, no, no, no. I know that because I've had to kind of go and look at the data. So what he does know is that obviously the C3Cs are increased by x percent and the overlap rate and the competition for the brand keywords, unlike brand exact, for example. Has increased year on year. The CPCs have therefore increased year on year, which means that we're having to spend more money to kind of maintain an impression, share. Rather than doing anything else and put it into non brand. And you're quite right. There's all you can do to influence that. But the pushback I'm getting is, well, I want you to target them. And it is a bit nonsensical in the sense that we're, we're only going to use. But also we're only going to use, for example, 50 quid. A day which is not even going to tickle their feet. Because they'll be spending 1500 pound a day on their own brand.
- Me: No.
- Them: But.
- Me: They're probably spending 1500 quid a day on. On smarting as well, so they're obviously worried and it will be costing them an absolute fortune.
- Them: Yeah, but it's. I don't know whether he knows someone aspan on you. It's a personal thing, but it. It's one of those where.
- Me: Before with another client. He just wanted me to go get someone else just because he didn't like them.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, so I've just. I've just stopped. Well, not arguing, but I've stopped, kind of. I've just said to him, look, we'll do the. I think the P. Max one probably needs pausing. Because obviously that's just throwing up. This needs to be like a really specifically targeted thing. So I think if we. The smise and search competitor, there's a UK competitor ad group.
- Me: Okay? Yeah.
- Them: If we. Reactivate this competitor search campaign and only as we had done, only target Aspinall. We've got Aspanol London diaries in there, which I'm not. Entirely sure if we can pause that.
- Me: Okay? I added. I had it down for ten quid, but I'll. I'll put it to 50.
- Them: Stick. Stick 50 quid on it, and then on Monday I'll go to the meeting.
- Me: Go have a budget, though. Mate.
- Them: I'll rob. Blame seb. If this is one of those examples internally where you can't win.
- Me: No.
- Them: Because. You resist doing the thing because it doesn't make sense, but then because you didn't do it. You can't then argue that it didn't work. So.
- Me: You could say we spent 300, 313 quid on that. We got seven quid. But how is that ever a good business decision?
- Them: Yeah, well, let's do that. Let's do the. That search one, and then.
- Me: Well, I've got three keywords in there. Aspen all of London. Aspen of London diaries. Asked me all 2026 diary.
- Them: I mean, I don't need the diaries. No. Get rid of Aspinall 20.
- Me: Do you want me to do? Just Aspinall.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. And it's exact match, isn't it? So I don't know.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Whether I don't know whether people search.
- Me: I could have asked in all trade.
- Them: Yeah, so that would just be Aspinal, plus anything else.
- Me: Yeah. Do that as a phrase match.
- Them: Yeah, because there'll be Aspinall. People search for Aspinalls.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: But. Yeah, yeah, pause the diaries. Related ones. Phrase match on Aspinall. 50 quid a day and then. I'll look at this account on Monday and then we'll say all of the good use of 300 quid, whatever else.
- Me: Stop buying mummy.
- Them: It's politics. I'll tell you.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And another reason for me not working for somebody rather than me. Yeah. Being me freelance. It just drive me absolutely nuts. I'm glad you're dealing with that end of it.
- Them: Yeah, that's the stuff I. I will do. That's the. That's what I bring to the table.
- Me: Cool. You're welcome.
- Them: Cool. That's all the bits, then. So I'm clear on pbc assets.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: And what we're doing. So I'll folder them all up, send the links across Google Drive links. All be there for.
- Me: For God's sakes. Talk about being connected. Now the phone rings on my. On my computer as well, which is great for talking, but when I'm on a call like this with phone rings and it's my daughter and it's just like, Last order dates.
- Them: Yes, I have got them. So they'll come over before lunch as well.
- Me: Great stuff.
- Them: And I think last year we just put a site link in. To say, you know, I've got. I've got them here, actually. I've got a tab for it in my document delivery cut off site link. Order by 22nd December. Description. I want for delivery by Christmas to trip from line two shop now.
- Me: Great.
- Them: So I've got all of those. I'll update all the dates.
- Me: I presume they're being from last year. Were they?
- Them: Yeah, I'll just double check because I have been sent them now.
- Me: Okay? Because what I'll also do is put those if you've got. If you got them in text when they're last order date is by country. That'll be fantastic.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely uk, US And Europe, because that all comes out of the Europe one all comes out of European.
- Me: Okay? So what I'll be doing then is I will be.
- Them: Hub.
- Me: Applying that. I'll be using that for the. The budget tracking. Or the the budget prediction so that I can start to pull back on budgets based upon that last order date. So Christmas Christmas gift is one of Christmas gift campaign. If it's they're not going to get it in time so I can stop all on that last order date.
- Them: And we have to. No. Yeah, that. That's pretty much what we did last year. It's almost. You almost stop spending entirely. For what would the normal one over there.
- Me: Yeah. No problem.
- Them: In. It's like if normally like a few days they save the last UK that it was the 22nd and then between the. On the 23rd and up until we put so long on the 24th, we don't really.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: It's like the two days of the year where there's nothing really to say.
- Me: No, that's.
- Them: But yeah. So assets.
- Me: Well, I've just started factoring in P9. Because that starts next week. So I'm just looking at budgets and stuff and looking at.
- Them: I would say usual process.
- Me: Like the predictions and stuff for. For sales, when things are going to tail off and all the rest. In that way, the budget is going to fit in with that. Do we have a P10 now? A budget for P10?
- Them: So you P10. Google spend a P10 is 14 1.
- Me: O. Kay. Right.
- Them: And you've got one. 81. 81. For p9.
- Me: P9. Yep, yep, no problem.
- Them: But bearing in mind as well, obviously, we talked about possibly having a lack of, you know, having sort of front loaded to spend this one. Cyber Monday is p1, is p9.
- Me: Yes. Yeah.
- Them: So you. Yeah. So you've got.
- Me: Yeah. I'm going to leave it. I'm not even going to change the budget on Monday. I don't want to. I don't want to piss about with it at all.
- Them: No.
- Me: Monday's budget will be what it is. And then hopefully on Tuesday get around to just reassessing the budgets for. For P9. I've started it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Based upon last year's trajectory, which is difficult because of rest of the world not being around at that time. But the rest of the world cut off is going to be before, well, before everybody else, isn't it? So that will need to be factored in as well. So I'm not going to finish. Doing the strategy on P9 until I know what the last order date says.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because that was. It's going to have an impact. Well, I'll factor in that impact on how much it's going to spend.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, fine. So I'll send you over last dates. I'll get all these stuff for Tuesday boxed up into folders.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And sent across and then. There's no actions on a copy font for me. On your feet at the moment. The next thing I'll do on that will be for the gifts promo on the 8th.
- Me: Okay? Just.
- Them: Which I'll do Thursday next week.
- Me: So just a quick one from a. From a personal perspective. Well, personal business perspective. This is taking a lot of time. I'm not going to hold you to ransom here on this at all. I know that the situation. I'm not about to increase my. My fee or anything like this. This is taking a massive amount of my time at the moment. Just what it noted. And also, what's the plan for the New year? Do you? I know it's only yesterday she went, but you must have it in your head as to what's likely to be happening.
- Them: Well, it'll be a bit. Bit of a coin toss at the moment, to be honest.
- Me: Right whether to take it back in house or to leave it as.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. And it will depend. It'll depend on when we kind of go out there to.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: If there really is nothing. Then I'm not going to do it.
- Me: Okay? All right. Okay?
- Them: But yeah, I think one thing for us to kind of ever think about over the next days, weeks, etc. Is how do we kind of. Get our. Coalition, your time perspective, how do we kind of protect your time in terms of kind of how we were working over the summer? Or is it just a seasonal thing? Is it because of the seasonality? It's a lot warmer. So how do we switch, you and I, get the balance back to what we had over the summer when we looked?
- Me: Yeah. I mean, as. As far as I'm. If I. And this is the. This is the reason for asking the question, because for me, there's loads of projects to do. There's loads of projects to do in that sort of out of season time to get this back into a state of. Even prior to when I first started with you, you know, it all needs sorting out. All the feeds and he's sorting out. There needs to be processes put in place for doing what we're doing now, which is changing text and so on. An organization for the images.
- Them: At that.
- Me: A strategy going forward, being able to produce forecasts and stuff.
- Them: Probably what was happening there because.
- Me: There's a lot of. There's a lot of stuff. Off season to be done.
- Them: More lines and sound. More bindings as well. They were going to start invisible. They are going to be. We just need to have a check rate and make sure that we're discovered. Shit. And all of that started replacing us in there for the whole rookie room. Step out. Inventory assigned.
- Me: Looking at now? I wish that one. But. It is, and there's nothing we can do about it. Right. Now. That's a massive project. So anyway. Okay?
- Them: Yeah, no, I hear that. Cool. Okay, let me come back with those actions, then.
- Me: All right.
- Them: Yeah. Anything else? Ping me. Hopefully it will kind of. It'll be a bit. More streamlined. Let's go with this.
- Me: Hopefully. Happy black Friday, mate.
- Them: Yeah, you too. I'll speech in a bit. Cheers. By. E.

## Strategic Decisions

- Restructure responsibilities with Peter taking full control of technical strategy and optimization
- Implement gentler asset change strategy to minimize conversion rate disruption
- Create separate sale asset groups with minimal headline changes

## Key Learnings

- Wholesale asset changes cause 2-3 day learning phase that impacts performance
- Minimal headline changes are preferable to complete asset overhaul
- Rely on promotion extensions for sale visibility

## Transcript

--- Enhanced Notes ---
### Lauren’s Departure & Decision Rationale

- Made decision to let Lauren go yesterday due to performance issues
- Key problems identified:
- Lacked confidence managing accounts independently
- Required excessive oversight and hand-holding
- Made fundamental errors (wrong Black Friday promo dates, missing Cyber Monday)
- Struggled in team meetings when questioned about paid search performance
- No clear organization for Christmas launch planning
- Would have taken 2+ weeks to get basic deliverables that Peter provides immediately
- Wasn’t the right fit for internal paid search expert role despite clear job requirements

### Current Performance & Metrics

- Strong recent performance metrics:
- Last week: 1,500 online shoppers, 37% were new customers (up 2% vs last year)
- Monday: +9% vs forecast, +10% vs last year, +14% like-for-like
- Tuesday: +19% vs forecast, +21% vs last year, +23% like-for-like
- Customer base recovery: only 4% below last year (previously 10% down)
- Conversion rate analysis shows significant drops when wholesale asset changes made
- Black Friday changeover caused 2-3 day learning phase impact
- Need gentler approach for future promotional switches

### Restructured Responsibilities

- Peter takes full control of:
- Budget pacing and technical strategy
- Account-level optimizations
- Copy and image implementation
- Company handles:
- Monthly budget allocation by region
- Asset briefs and creative direction
- Brand compliance and copy approval
- Front-end customer experience checks

### Countdown Timer for Black Friday

- Need wording for countdown timer
- Suggested: “Black Friday ends in…” (keep short due to variable expansion)
- Political preference to avoid “sale” terminology

### Christmas Asset Transition Strategy

- Switch from Black Friday to Christmas assets Tuesday morning
- Process refinement:
- Remove all Black Friday images first
- Add generic Christmas gifting images across all campaigns
- Manual implementation required for Performance Max asset groups
- Testing automated spreadsheet import system for future efficiency
- Priority: ensure no Black Friday content visible post-Monday

### Gift Promotion (8/12 to 14/12)

- 20% off selected gifts promotion
- Approach: minimal headline changes (3-4 headlines max) vs wholesale takeover
- Rely on merchant promotion extensions for visibility
- Avoid conversion rate drops seen with Black Friday’s extensive changes

### Sale Campaign Strategy (24/12 to 25/1)

- Three-phase approach planned:
- Up to 50% off launch (24th Dec)
- Further reductions (early Jan)
- 50% off + extra 10% with code (final week)
- Implementation strategy:
- Create separate sale asset groups alongside existing campaigns
- Replace only bottom 3-4 headlines in existing groups
- Use automated spreadsheet system if Tuesday test successful
- Timing: activate between 4-6pm Christmas Eve after stores close

### RSAs Post Black Friday

- Need to update Responsive Search Ads separately from Performance Max
- Focus on headline changes only, keep descriptions unchanged
- Promotion extensions will handle sale messaging below ads

### Last Order Dates

- Need country-specific last order dates for budget management
- Will use dates to automatically reduce spend on Christmas gift campaigns
- Expect 2-day spending hiatus (23rd-24th Dec) between last orders and sale launch

### Aspinall Competitor Targeting

- Political pressure to target Aspinall despite questionable ROI
- Previous spend: £313 for £7 return
- Compromise: £50/day budget on exact/phrase match “Aspinall” keywords until Monday
- Overlap rate increased from 15% to 75% year-on-year causing CPC inflation

### Next Steps

- Share Christmas asset folders via Google Drive today
- Provide last order dates before lunch
- Update gift promotion copy in shared spreadsheet Thursday next week
- Test automated asset import system before Tuesday
- Activate Aspinall competitor campaign at £50/day
- Discuss longer-term resource planning and New Year staffing approach

Me: Lost all the dates. All right. Mate.
Them: Mute again.
Me: Hello.
Them: Wish it would just. I wish it would just not have it as mute at the start.
Me: Does it default to mute at the beginning?
Them: By. Yeah, I thought it was. Normally when there was more than one other person in the room, it would default to mute.
Me: Okay?
Them: But nevertheless.
Me: I need it to make me a cup of tea when I start the meeting.
Them: How are you? Yeah. Finished the one that I had on the train this morning, and then I try and leave it until 11 to go get another one. Tell you.
Me: It's been a busy weekend.
Them: Wow. What a week. What a week.
Me: I wasn't expecting that, mate.
Them: What a week. No. Well, I just said no, like I wasn't. Honestly, it's my choice, but. Yeah. So I had to make a decision.
Me: Okay?
Them: Had to make it, take a decision and. I mean, in terms of. The sort of fit for this role that we need. You know, I, I, you know, we do desperately need someone who can kind of stand and learn two feet and confidently manage it. You know, I think you've had to do a lot more of the heavy lifting. Which is long term, not. Not what we want. And you know what? To be honest, I mean, I didn't necessarily share it all in this group that we had because I didn't want it to come across like I was sort of beating the stick in front of someone else.
Me: I would keep your mad down as well. Mate.
Them: Yeah, but the amount of stuff that I just think. That. Honestly, I've got three pages of. Things that just. And this is, like, fundamental hygiene stuff that I think, like, from when she joined. You'd thinking, right? First kind of couple of weeks, I'm going to get under the bonnet of everything and make sure that everything that's possibly going to be shown to a customer is accurate, you know? It's where it ought to be. There didn't seem to be. A kind of much organization from her end on, like things like Christmas launch. Or like it wasn't clear from what she was telling me that there was a plan. You know, this is the work we got to do. This is how we're splitting it. And even Black Friday as well. You know, I think we have the wrong promo dates. In because she assumed that because the financial period ends on Sunday, That the primary must end on Sunday as well.
Me: Okay?
Them: But completely missing Cyber Monday.
Me: Cyber Monday.
Them: But there's never been any communication. So I checked. The Merchant sent the promos that you set up. Because I thought, well, if Lauren didn't know what the dates were, Did you know what the dates were? And they were fine. So I'm like, well, how have we got a site linked promo? Showing to customers at the promo ends on the 30th. And it's unfortunately, it's kind of like series of mistake after mistake, a mistake like that. That we were. We're spending the most important time of the year. Trying to fix those basic things rather than figuring out how do we kind of, you know, over perform.
Me: Squeeze the nuts out of it.
Them: Yeah. And I think you know the kind of. Especially with our team as well. It's like, and I think, to be honest, I mean, some of the feedback I've had from other people since yesterday is that they felt she struggled in the meetings in terms of, like, our team meetings on a Monday to try and explain how Pace Search was performing and, like, kind of almost any question from Seb. Just ended up with kind of like a deer in headlights. Look. So I think she relied a lot on you. But if. The thing was, you know, if it was that. If the goal was to have someone internally, then they can't rely on you like it should be. You're there as an expert, as a bit of guidance, you know, even in a kind of a mentor role. But ultimately, she needs to kind of be confident and know enough that she's. That she's driving it. So.
Me: It's funny from my perspective. It's why I don't work for anyone. I'll be honest with you. It's why I don't work for anyone, because I just get on with it. I don't do committees. I don't do massive meetings. If I'm being trusted to look after an account, then I'm being trusted. I'll just do it. I don't need to have a couple of meetings to say, is that all right? It's like the Black Friday countdown timer asking you whether it's all right. Well, yeah. Okay. There's a process of. This is what I'm doing. You look at it and go, oh, by the way, don't put sale. Put this right. Okay. It's not. Is it okay if I do? This. I've just sent it to this person, this person, this person, this person. And then waiting a week for it to come back, because that will happen.
Them: Yeah.
Me: We're on the leading edge of this right now.
Them: No, to be honest, that's. That's a good point. I mean. Because when I'm being asked, is it okay to do it? Well, I don't know. Is that okay? I mean, if you said to me, this is what we're doing, Can you just make sure you're happy with the words?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay, cool. I wouldn't even think to question whether it's a good or bad idea. I just trust it's a good idea and it's going to make more money. But when it's like, You know, because I don't. Yeah, Like, I struggled a bit with that conversation. It was like. She seemed kind of very unsure. It even went to start it. And it's like. But I need you to kind of have. You need to back your own decisions, you know, just make a decision. Otherwise, I'm kind of sat there thinking, well, I don't even know if we should be doing it because we don't even know when we should be starting it or. Do we even bother? So. Yeah, I mean, that and that kind of indecision. Sort of means, then I spend more time. Just checking. And then the problem is, then you start checking, then you start finding bits and you're thinking, well, you know. And I know it's not. It's not necessarily a fair way of looking at the world, but I think, right, you're here for 40 hours a week. The only thing I need you to do is just. You've got Peter support, but just keep on top of these accounts, make sure that everything's. Optimized. That's it. I don't need to do anything else. I don't want you to try and help on paid social or help anyone else or do anything other than just focus solely. Just do the best you can in that area. But. Yeah, so it's. Yeah, it's a horrible decision to have to make, but. I think it was the right one. I don't think she was likely to kind of come on leaps and bounds. I think she was feeling the pressure. Quite a lot.
Me: The problem is agency side. You're getting fed bits and pieces when.
Them: And then I think, Yeah.
Me: You're actually responsible for everything you need to know everything.
Them: Yeah. And she did mention that, you know, into HR yesterday, that she was used to having someone like an exec to kind of do the doing. But. But then we made that so clear when we put this role out. Yeah. And we kind of, you know, we made it so clear when we put this role out that, like, you have to be the internal page charts expert. Like, you have to be willing to do the doing, but also be involved in the thinking. So, yeah, we really kind of handed that. And. Yeah. Yeah. So difficult choice, but then, you know. The easy thing would be to try and look, overlook everything, and then just spend the rest of my life trying to convince myself and Seb that it's all fine. Or, you know, constantly covering. And I don't think it would have worked out. I wouldn't have had confidence at the end of January, if you were to go and she was to be managing all this all by herself. I wouldn't have the confidence that things would be. Getting handled. Because even though the stuff you sent over yesterday. It would probably take two weeks for me to get that. From Lauren, respectfully. Whereas that. It's like, you know what? It's like when you got kind of like, you know, Paolo's asking seven and then seven then asking me, and it's because he needs it for a bought meeting on Thursday. And it's like, well, I need answers. Like, they don't have to. Be kind of 100% correct, but it's just got to be kind of close enough to.
Me: Apologies to that. That was quite embarrassing, that, and I'm glad you checked it because. And it was obvious at the end, there's either account level starts for certain things and there's campaign level stats because like US UK business with the conversion action, sometimes it has to drop back to campaign.
Them: Y. Es.
Me: And for some reason, it did.
Them: But that second set of numbers that, because I looked at the first set at 185 or 1, 95 for the UK, I thought that looks like almost looks too far away from the double counted number. But the two A8, actually, even though I didn't know of that by that point, I didn't know which one to go for, but the 288 felt like. Just felt a bit closer to where it was. And that's all we need to kind of get to is go right.
Me: Yeah, yeah.
Them: You know, brand revenue in the UK hasn't actually cut in half. That's not true, because when you strip out the double counting, it's actually a lot closer. Or actually it's slightly under. We're slightly up, sorry, this year. And it just tells a completely different story.
Me: There's a different level of positivity in those numbers. The fact the brand non brand has been increased.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, it's. It's. And you are likely to be getting more new customers. Is that. Is that being reflected in the numbers or not?
Them: Yeah, we saw that for last week, so I think I'll just pull it up quick. So we had. Bear with me. Your second weekly reports. So for last week. I will click on the right report. Here we go. So. Yeah, so we had just under 1, 500 people shop online last week and. The. Oh, the first. Hang on. 37% of people last week were new.
Me: Wow. Wow, wow, wow.
Them: So that is that.
Me: It's such a strong brand. That's pretty impressive, isn't it?
Them: Is. Yeah. So I'll show you. Let me just see if you can. I can share this with you. I'm not sure if it's going to.
Me: Who don't want to pay for it.
Them: No, no, that's it. So, yeah, we had just under 2,600 customers shopped last week, so that's up 76% on the previous week. 961 of them, so 37% of them were brand new.
Me: Wow.
Them: Which is up 2%. On last year.
Me: Very good.
Them: So that's. Yeah, so that's pretty good. So the number, and the big one is, you know, the number of people that have shopped in the last 12 months, and that's only 4% below last year now. I got one point that was kind of like 10% below.
Me: Right.
Them: And that's. That's just website numbers. And then what's been more encouraging? Which I'm keen for us to take as much credit as possible is the numbers for the first two days of this week.
Me: Right.
Them: So.
Me: Is that what you sent through this morning?
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So for Monday, we were 9% up on forecast, plus 10 to last year and then plus 14, like for like. And then yesterday, which is the one I sent this morning, we were plus 19 first, our forecast, plus 21 to the year and plus 23 like for like, so.
Me: Great.
Them: That's strong. That's really strong. That's really kind of clawing back. The problem is we don't get consistent performance like that. So I'll be really intrigued to see. How the rest of this week goes.
Me: Well, we're black Friday week, aren't we? So. The bloody dashboard's gone down this morning. I'll get. I'll get the numbers updated. That dashboard, which I've created. In fact, let me. Let me kick it off now. We should have that at the end because it's giving us a kind of prediction. It's all fingering the air job, this.
Them: Yeah.
Me: My concern is we spent too much money too soon. You know that? Should we should have just. Held on until this week before going full on with it. But depending on what time of day I run the prediction, depends on whether we're going to smash the target. Well, just beat the target or be about 200 grand below it. So which will be, you know, it's. When you looked at those figures for the revenue figures against last year, you could see it peaking now.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, it was it last year, it was fairly flat, and then it started to go up. It's going to be fascinating to see what happens. I can't wait until and I'm hoping still around at this time, it's I can't wait till May so that when we're doing year on year comparisons. We can actually do year on year comparisons, Right. Pissing about with the conversion action on it that will make things so much easier. So.
Them: Yes. Yeah. Then it really is, like, for, like. Because it's just a nightmare to try and look at at a minute.
Me: Yes. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
Them: So I had a couple of bits just to cover this morning. Probably mainly just in kind of rebalancing. Kind of between us, who's doing what. I. I expect it'll probably go back to what we did over the summer. As in, you know, I. I can communicate all of the budgets per month.
Me: Great.
Them: And then happy for you to kind of chop those up performance wise how you want to between uk, us, Roan, eu, but I can give you the top line number.
Me: There's going to be more in Europe. I think the latest budget pushed a bit more towards Europe because it's doing well and rest of the world because there was nothing there last year. It's low hanging fruit that, you know, it's a lot of brown in.
Them: Yeah.
Me: One thing.
Them: Yeah. So I'll definitely. I'll keep sending those over to you, and then I won't. Get involved in kind of. Who, What. Where's the account necessarily? Because I think that'll end up being a pain in the ass for you. I'm going in there adjusting stuff, and then you're going in there and going, I didn't bloody do that.
Me: Yep.
Them: So I'll leave that to you. The only things I'll do is.
Me: I'll know. I will.
Them: Just be kind of checking over from a copy and a creative point of view that it's. Yeah.
Me: I'll paint it at another pair of eyes, mate, I. I don't take exception to it at all. People looking at it like that. If you see something it's not right, you tell me and I'll. And I'll get it sorted. But just tell me you don't need to change. It yourself. Just say what about such and such a thing.
Them: Right. Cool.
Me: Because I do. I. I can't look at everything. This is huge. It is absolutely huge.
Them: Oh, yes, I'm happy. I will just do my kind of just sanity checks. These are the campaigns that are on. These are the headlines that are shown to customers. You know, are we from a brand perspective? Are we missing anything? Is there any more new information or new. Bits that we should consider and then I'll ping them over. But, yeah, so in terms of, like, eyes on, if you handle the pacing and the technical and the strategy side, we'll work on that.
Me: And the copy and the images.
Them: Yeah. Then I'm. I'm. I'm happy to keep an eye on. What's coming up in terms of. I'll do all the asset briefs and stuff, so. And get those all delivered over. And then I will just keep an eye on from a. More from like a front end, what the customer might and might not be seeing. And just make sure that if there's any tweaks we need to be doing,
Me: Great.
Them: Then.
Me: Okay?
Them: I can throw in that over, but. Yeah, I guess I just want to be able to let you do your thing that you're good at rather than having to.
Me: Well, I mean, the thing is. I mean, I'm on the. I'm on the back foot. Without a shadow of a doubt, because I have no idea. Well, I have a rough idea what the plan was. I'm kind of ready for the asset changes on Tuesday. The issue I'm going to have is images. Those the images per campaign. I have not got a clue what's going to go where, and that's going to be pain in the ass because I can't necessarily do that. Programmatically, it's going to be a case of going into the individual asset groups and picking what images to use. And it's funny, last year I picked one images to use and nobody complained. I know we need to be put in the right thing out for the business, but, you know, it was a case just get. For me, it's about getting images in there. First and foremost for quality scoring the account because it likes images and secondly, it's making sure that the right images because I, I know they make most of the time and make diddly shit difference to whether it's going to convert or not, especially on the pmax. It does. You know, there's a huge amount of importance attached to the images because of brand, but in terms of actual performance,
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's. It. It's minimal in the mix. It's very minimal. But I will have to work through those manual, I think.
Them: And is there any way, is there anything I can be doing between now and then to just support that? Just thinking out loud, really? Like, is there anything you can give me and say, look. What are we putting these?
Me: Well.
Them: Or would you prefer that I'm just sort of doing checks once you're doing stuff?
Me: I think it's just doing checks. I mean, there's a certain amount of knowledge is required on the Google Ads interface to see what images are going where.
Them: Y.
Me: And it has to be down into the asset because I have to drill down to the asset group, see what's there, get rid of all the Black Friday ones. I can't do that. Carte blanche. What I might do.
Them: Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: What I might do on Tuesday morning. First thing is just get rid of all the Black Friday images. And then start to add the images back in again. In terms of priority.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I think. Image. Image and text. If we just.
Me: That was Lauren's favorite phrase. That makes sense. And you just look at it go. It doesn't, does it?
Them: What? Oh, no.
Me: I shouldn't take the mic.
Them: Don't. No, I think if we just purge. The most important thing is that on Tuesday morning, any. Sniff of Black Friday is perched from these accounts.
Me: Yeah, that's going to be the hard. One.
Them: And then. A case of just adding in the. Christmas gift in. I need to check what you have. I don't know if I can see what.
Me: I mean, the thing is, if this, if they. If there are generic Christmas images.
Them: Was.
Me: Christmas gift images I can drop into everything. That'll be awesome. Because then I can just go through and just blast it. I can just.
Them: Shall I just find the flipping folder that they chuck it all in and just. I'll go and I'll send them over. Just so you've got a visual reference of, like, all of these are absolutely fine to be chucked in.
Me: It took him anywhere.
Them: Yeah, and it's like generic gifting.
Me: Yeah, that would be awesome.
Them: How. How are we going to work it from a. Structure point of view. So for P Max, will it just be. Generic Christmas gifting. Because then that would make sense. We could just chuck all of the generic Christmas gift in, and then we'll go what category level with RSAs.
Me: I'm only saying. Yeah, I mean. Well, the RSA is no images. So are those. So the asset groups say for like the leather bags, both as a Christmas gifting image. That's fine.
Them: Or you just. No, no, no. No, that's fine.
Me: That's not a problem. It doesn't have to be a picture of a bag. You know, so if we can, if they. If there are a number of Christmas gifting images.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That you could show me. Then I can identify where they sit in Google Ads and prepare things. And it's going to be mentally, because I'm going to have to do it. I'm going to have to do it in a, on a, on a manual basis. I will just go in and swap all those out for the, for the. The Black Friday ones and do that first thing on on Tuesday. I'll have an early start or something on Tuesday and try and get them done before 9:00.
Them: Okay? I'll find. I'll get them to resend me the folder with all of the P. Max Christmas stuff that we had pre Black Friday. And then what I'll probably do is. Have you got access to any folders and assets? How did Lauren normally give them to you?
Me: All over the show. I, I, I don't know. I don't know.
Them: Okay? Well, I do have a Google Drive folder, and I can say I can follow them. Christmas. Pmax gifting. Generic gift in. Everything in here is generic gifting. Do what you want with it.
Me: Go. That's all I want.
Them: These images. I only want them on. Bags.
Me: Y.
Them: For example, I'll just folder in Google Drive show you the folder link.
Me: Eah. You make it as simple as you possibly can for me.
Them: And then. Yeah.
Me: That would be great.
Them: Okay?
Me: And then what I'll do then is I'll change. I'll. I'll swap out the Black Friday ones first. For the, for the generic gifting. And then if there's any additional ones you want for specific asset groups, then I can add those in afterwards. But the priorities to get the Christmas gifts.
Them: Yeah. And I will just. I'll say these can be used for this. Whether you actually have an asset group, live for it.
Me: Fantastic.
Them: Fine, doesn't matter. But if you did, it's there. If you wanted to make one, that's there. If you don't need to use it, don't use it. So, okay, so I'll do that. From an asset point, from a creative imagery point of view, that's fine. And I'LL share that with you today.
Me: Yeah. Brilliant. Wonderful. Yeah.
Them: Let's just talk about. Headlines and descriptions for a minute, so. Did we before we change to from Christmas to Black Friday, did we save down.
Me: Yep, got them all.
Them: Cool.
Me: Thankfully.
Them: Is there anything on there? That you think I need to have a look at? Because I know we made lots of, like, can we change this to this? Or this wasn't. The free delivery threshold was wrong. Is there anything. You can share over with me and I'll just go for a review and change just so that we're not putting back anyone. So like anything that we've any business as usual headlines and descriptions that we've corrected over this period.
Me: Yeah.
Them: We're not then going to put. The outdated ones back in.
Me: Y. Ep. Now. That's the folder. That's the g sheet. Just give you. Editor.
Them: There.
Me: So that that workbook has got us ad copy, uk, Europe and rest of world.
Them: Okay, perfect. So I'll just scan it and if there's any. Things that are factually out of date, I will just create it. And I guess then that's your. That's your kind of, like, copy bank, is it? For want of a better word.
Me: That. That. That structure in there is brilliant for me. I've got something that works on that.
Them: Okay?
Me: So any copy going forward. I know you've got your own version of the copy, but that. Is is more workable for me than what we have at the moment. I find the one we've got at the moment is a bit all over the show, and I know that's because it's marketing need to look at it and approve and all the rest of it, but.
Them: Yeah, it just serves a different purpose, that's all.
Me: It does. It does. But for me, that I can take that I've written something. That takes that and puts it in.
Them: Right, okay. Fine. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
Me: So it makes it easy for me to see it that way. But bear that in. Bear in mind, having said that, that is what will go in. Yeah. So if you have a little bit of a Tourette's moment on one of those boxes, then that's what will get loaded up. So there's no. There's no double check on it. That's raw data. That. That's the stuff that I use.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: So just handle with care.
Them: Yeah. That's fine. That's fine. Okay, and then the last. The second question on copy. So the next sort of marketing activation is this 20 off selected GIFs.
Me: Yep.
Them: That's from the 8th of December till the 14th. Now that the theme around that, I mean, that's literally this idea was born at like 4:00 yesterday afternoon. It is sticking with the Christmas gifting theme. But 20 selected amount of our Christmas gifts. We'll have 20 off. So. What I was saying yesterday was, I think. We could probably just drop in headlines and descriptions to. Because they'll complement the Christmas messaging anyway, because it's Christmas gift in promo. I don't want to do a takeover like Black Friday. It's not that kind of thing. It's more. Here's half a dozen headlines. And half a dozen descriptions. Put them, sprinkle them where they need to be sprinkled. So that, you know, customers see them. But we're not kind of wholesale changing anything.
Me: Did you see that? Just. Just on that point, then, did you see that the conversion rate graphs are sent over to Lauren yesterday? And we saw.
Them: For the headlines.
Me: No, it was the conversion rates.
Them: You send out an email on the teams group.
Me: No, I think you sent it on teams. Oh, it was. It was partly to do with the search impression share as well.
Them: Oh, was that around the. I saw something.
Me: Let me just share my screen with you.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Rather than me trying to guess what.
Me: This is. It's. Yeah. Oh, I can visualize it now. So this is conversion rate year on year.
Them: Y.
Me: And it's really quite interesting to see, like, the uk, what happened then. The UK. This just freak you out completely for 2025? We see that big drop here. We see another one for the US there. Not as noticeable for Europe, but those two there. That's when we changed the asset groups. That's when we did that massive change.
Them: Okay. So is that. Yeah.
Me: Yeah. So this is what I was warning about prior to Christmas and about the stats through about what was the impact of going to Black Friday. Wholesale. That's the impact. So we see this and we go, oh, that's amazing, isn't it? Look at it. It's the conversion rate here, but how much did that cost? There for that to drop down and come back up again. It takes two or three days every time for the. So it goes into sort of like a mini learning phase.
Them: Yeah.
Me: When you change that much stuff because it has to reassess what it is. So the idea when we go into sale of let's just take it easy.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And let's just change a headline. And rely on merchant promoter. The merchant extension. Promotion Extensions. Can I get it right? Promotion extensions within the search ads. So that's where you get an extra little bit of text underneath the ad and then within the shopping ads, which is the majority of your. Your generic traffic.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It will have a strike, say it's a sale, so. That's the difference.
Them: So how do we.
Me: Between them.
Them: How do we. I don't know if this is a process thing, but how do we find the balance between. And it only happens. There's only Black Friday in Sale where this happens. And it's like, well. It's a bit like, obviously, when the window changes on Christmas and then all the red banners come down for sale.
Me: Absolutely.
Them: Like we. We need to have. Just kind of figure out the best way to. We need to have maximum visibility for sale from the 24th.
Me: Yeah.
Them: How do we achieve that? Without chopping the head off. Conversion rate. Is it like you say, launching with. You know, obviously, the merchant center promotion and two to three headlines, and then can we drop in? Can we. Can we just increase it every day, the visibility?
Me: I think.
Them: Rather than dropping everything in on launch day. Launch night.
Me: If you think what happens? We get these 15 headlines to get dropped in. So, like, the majority of them, pretty much. Well, pretty much all of them were changed. So it's going to go Shit. I don't know what to do here.
Them: Yeah.
Me: If you actually just went in and did three or four.
Them: Okay, that's that. That'll be happy with.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: Because there's. There's only three or four ways to say up to 50% off.
Me: There's only so many ways to say Black Friday. We still managed 15. Yeah. So we've got to be careful with that, actually. And those stats are sent over about the performance of the headlines over. Over this last seven days, this short period of time. There's a lot of traffic has been that it's the promo ones that work the best. Now. Promo ones work the best. I think click through rate and conversion rates were the best. So what Google's going to do is it's going to go well. I'm going to show them then.
Them: Yeah. Y.
Me: Yeah. So it's going to do it anyway. It's going to. It's going to. It's going to promote those anyway. You can have an asset group, which is sale.
Them: Eah.
Me: So the sale one gets set up alongside what you've already got. Never stop what we've already got. Apart from Christmas. But that's a whole campaign. But you set up the sale asset group. And the audiences that it's promoting are people who are interested in a sale. So the search themes within there will be about a sale. So that's specifically people looking for a sale and you drop that in alongside what we've already got. So there'll be the duplication. It doesn't matter. With asset groups, all the asset group is a different view on a different group of products so you can have the same products in the same thing. So you drop that in there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: On everywhere. You have an account level promotion extension.
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: The sale one will be very in your face. This is a sale. Whereas the ones that, the existing ones will have two or three headlines that you will change and we can just drop them at the bottom of the. Of the headlines. Just replace the bottom three headlines we've already got in the R6 groups with sale. Google go. Oh, what's that? Oh, new shiny thing. Let's go and have a look at that. They'll put it up there. And if it's a sale. You might find them. Immediately, people start increasing, they click through, rate will start to go up and so therefore it will then show more.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: Then at the end of it, we swap those out to what they were previously. And happy days.
Them: Yeah. Okay, well, I'm happy. I'm happy with us. Magic. I think maybe it's. An educational piece for the people here as well, and just in terms of, you know, because.
Me: Very much.
Them: Especially when you kind of see the data. I'd be really interested. I know it's not. Apples and apples, but. We did what we did on Black Friday. Fine. We now managed to sail the way you've just described, so I'm happy with that. Because I haven't got 50. I don't need to put 15 headlines in. We've got. Like you say, for example, being extreme. You've got 10 business as usual, Christmas gifting. Christmas. Well, not Christmas gifted by them, but, you know, autumn, wintery Christmas, lovely business as usual stuff. And then five sale ones.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And then off you go.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I would be interested post sale as much as we can to kind of see. How we've not necessarily damaged conversion rates with the asset changes because we're doing a lot less asset changes, therefore, because that'd be a really good piece to kind of show the business to say, look. We're managing it this way. There's actually, you know. A lot less detrimental effects. Than what we did this time. So, yeah, I mean, that's absolutely fine. And I think.
Me: This is huge analysis piece on that. It'd be. It'd be fascinating to see. And the actual impact of the. Of the gifting one for Christmas. If we get it wrong, it's less impact than the Black Friday one.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But then we. We. I'll take both of those and go. This is what happened at that time. Let's do this big dobber of an analysis and say what was the right approach. And then come up with a. With a. A formula, if you like, for the. For the future. So I'm supposing this is what will happen. You know, that, that, that. And we can see from that conversion rate depth that that's what happened with the Black Friday. But will the same thing happen with the change in the not changing as many headlines in the asset groups? I actually don't know. But based upon best practices. And what Google have been saying, you don't do that, you just do a few of them.
Them: Yeah. And I. I agree. Yeah.
Me: It all makes sense. The logic is there. So it's. Whether it appears in practice or not is a different matter, but.
Them: Well, you've got. You've got the data for Black Friday. I mean, that's.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Quite. You know, it's difficult to argue with that.
Me: Y.
Them: Okay, so.
Me: What date is that? The sale.
Them: 24th is when it starts. So as a christmas eve one. And it not we have to normally wait until. So we'll figure out process wise, kind of, you know, how much you want to throw to me to just kind of click go, but it's normally like, When the last store shuts, we can then press go on the sale.
Me: Okay?
Them: So even if you've got everything set up, I'll be working. Until Sal goes live anyway. So even if you just want to give me.
Me: Is that 5:00?
Them: Go through and. It's between 4 and 6 on Christmas Eve. So we try and finish early on Christmas Eve. Because it's Christmas Eve. But we just literally just sat by. Sat by desks at home, waiting for the store to shut. And then you can go. Yeah, normally. Or at least half waiting to just press go.
Me: Right.
Them: And then we press go and everything between four and six.
Me: Okay?
Them: But. By all means. If you can get it to a place where we're ready. And you just need me to go. In, enable some asset groups or whatever.
Me: I don't know. I don't. I don't. I don't think there's anything I could give you to press a button on.
Them: Is it something that can be scheduled if we closer to the time new right? It's going live.
Me: Well, we're swapping out. You see, that's the problem. We're swapping out. We're swapping out. Asset groups are really weird. You can't. As you keep your asset group as it is, because that's where the history is. I know what you do. We're swapping out text, we're swapping out images.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: It's not as easy to do that as if you had an RSA or something, like a text ad where you could just run it in parallel with it and just flick it over. Or say now on pause. Pause that one. Make that one live. You can't do that with Mass. You got to physically go in and do it.
Them: Yes. I mean, I'm familiar with. Going into asset groups.
Me: Yeah. Be it up to go into every single asset group in all four accounts and shake if it had lines.
Them: If I. If I. If I had to, then that's an option. You know, if you were. If. If you were to. If you could provide me with the ones you want. Updating.
Me: It is a massive job. I could probably if based upon what happens with this the flick over from Black Friday to Christmas. This spreadsheet that I've just shared with you is our master spreadsheet. Okay? Of assets. If this. If this switchover works well. Then I'm going to use this spreadsheet as our spreadsheet for going forward, so we can actually change it on here. And then I can just run something. And it will just import all those and replace what we've already got.
Them: Right.
Me: So I'm going to use the learnings from this. For the 24th.
Them: Okay? Okay?
Me: Because that's a bit more critical. If it. If this goes. If this goes tits up on Tuesday and doesn't run through, there's no reason I've. I've done that many dry runs of it and I've used another client to try it on as well in. In real life, so. If this. If this works, it just means on the 24, I just have to give it a command here, and it will pull in whatever's in that spreadsheet. So we save that.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Then. It should be fine. You know, so we can. I can just go in and go, well, let's change these headlines, you know, 13, 14, 15 will change into this. Or let's change the Christmas ones to the. The. The. The new version for gifting, and then it will just suck it in. And.
Them: Right. So in theory, you could.
Me: Then.
Them: Upload all of these. Just, you know, you're not. Yes, I'm not. On Christmas Eve. If we said right. Half past four. Go, go, go.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Do that. All your changes happen, and then we're good.
Me: Yeah. All the text will go in. I'm going to experiment with images, see whether there's anything we do with that. I don't think we can. I don't think there's anything we can do with images because it. They're held in a very strange way within Google Ads, you know? It's like image id. It's not obvious what it is. And you can't pull the. The URL of the image and show the image in the. In the spread I'm getting very technically. But you can't show it in the G sheet, so you have to know what it is.
Them: Yeah. So you can't put right. Okay, so you can't just have a column for image URL, and then you've got the path. Okay. We're not going to have a huge amount because again, it's going to be a graphic. It's going to be image wise. It'll be similar to Black Friday.
Me: And how gonna last for.
Them: In terms of. That will go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I've got it for five weeks at the minute, so until almost the last week of January.
Me: Okay? See if I put the 28th or something.
Them: Go for. 25th. So the 24th of December to the 25th. Of jan. The added complexity, which isn't a problem today. Is there'll be three phases to this. Sale.
Me: Woohoo.
Them: Which will just record, say, just require just copy and possibly an image. Replacement. And that is so you've got up to 50% off launch on the 24th. Then I suspect in the first week of Jan. Ten days into Jan, it will change to further reductions. Tbc. Whether we update assets for that I'm not sure yet, but then the last week or so. Will be up to 50% off, plus an extra 10% with this code.
Me: Okay?
Them: So there will likely be three phases again. But I'd say we are a little bit off getting. Confirmation. I'm going to prep copy briefs. And asset briefs based on that happening, and then it'll either be there to use or not.
Me: Okay?
Them: One just question on this GIFS thing in terms of process and what's the best way for us to work. The paid media ad copy Google sheet. That I currently.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Use to put in the headlines and descriptions. Now. Does it make sense that I only add the descriptions in here? That should be added rather than trying to have everything in here. You've already got it in your sheet.
Me: No, I'm not with you.
Them: So bear with. So I'm just going to share. Can you see that?
Me: Yep.
Them: Okay, so 20 off gifs, live day, end date. Fine. Normally these headlines are full. With all of the BAU stuff, and then someone would drop in a few 20% off gift headlines.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Would you prefer that I only kept in this headlines the stuff that needs to be that is related to the thing we're talking about? So if I just put in three headlines for 20% off GIFs.
Me: Do you know what I really like?
Them: And then. Gone.
Me: Is for you not to use, not for me not to not look at that spreadsheet at all. For me to just be using for you to be going into, because I trust you now, is for you to be going into that one. That would be the ideal situation for me.
Them: How would be the best way for me to know where you want. Where you might want those. Headlines. Or descriptions to go. Or is that a.
Me: It doesn't matter.
Them: Moot point.
Me: Yeah, it doesn't matter. 1. One thing that you're going to notice when I do this swap over the of the assets is that you might not have in headline one smice in a Bond Street. At the top. It might be shop bags, stationary and more. And that again, going to be an educational piece. Just because it's in position one doesn't mean that's the priority at all. There is no priority in.
Them: Yeah.
Me: There.
Them: And how do we know what's the easiest way for me to kind of know what you've got? What should be updated then. Okay, so if I was to. If I keep my sheet just as a. Because that's what we're using internally.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So I will probably only just put in the headlines and the descriptions that relate to the proceed in this case 29 gives because then I know I've only got to put these into your sheet.
Me: Yeah.
Them: When I'm now looking at so pretend I've got those. I'm now looking at your sheet and I'm going to update the uk. I copy headlines.
Me: It's not easy.
Them: Is there a way for me to know what we've currently got live so that I'm not? Because, for example, there's stuff down towards the bottom that rows 28, 29 to 35 that like references. Spring Summer 24.
Me: Yeah, they could come out. Sorry. I didn't realize.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That.
Them: No, no, that's fine, but it's just so that I don't go through and update everything. Is there a way where you could say, look, just like, update the ones that are in bold?
Me: Just.
Them: Because those are the ones that we're using.
Me: I've just got rid of the I've just got rid of the ones that were not using.
Them: Okay, cool. So if I was once. I've got my copy for the gifts.
Me: I will update that. Mate. I will go in and update that. I didn't realize. Lauren's got this together based upon some stuff I sent over to her.
Them: Right.
Me: So I'm not. Let me do a clean on this. I'll clean the fire. I'll clean it up. And everything that's in there is live.
Them: Okay, that's. That's helpful. And then I will only update. I will have to. I presume I will need to say to you. Right. Peter, I'm ready to put the new headlines in. Just to make sure that that's not going to be sucked up.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So, for example. I obviously wouldn't put anything to do with 20 off gifts in here. Now, until we've we're post Black Friday.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So, for example, the promo starts on the 8th, so I might put these. In. On the fourth or fifth next week. And then I'll send you a message. Say, look, all you have 20% off gifts, headlines and descriptions are now in.
Me: The 8th, I think with 24th. Oh, for the gifting one.
Them: Sorry, we're on the. Yeah.
Me: Yep. Sorry.
Them: Yeah, I'm just thinking process wise. I think we need to. Obviously, I need to be clear with you that when I'm making actions to the sheet,
Me: Yeah.
Them: So that you don't do an update. And accidentally pull in half of the 20% off gift stuff, because I haven't told you that.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I'm putting it in. So.
Me: See, once I've run this. So this. This will get run on Tuesday and all these headlines and descriptions will get sucked in.
Them: Yes. So I obviously won't do anything for the next promo until after we're back to normal.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: At which point. I'll let you know that I'm updating it, and I'll let you know when it's updated.
Me: Yeah. So I know it's not ideal this, but I like this. Will get.
Them: But if the process is clear, it's. It's fine. Yeah, I mean, I don't. I don't mind.
Me: The only concern is that, you know, you. The unbeknownst to you, you're going to be changing stuff that's working really well. I. I don't have time to. To accommodate that at all.
Them: Well, I'm. I'm going to have to do it just based on taking stuff out that's just not appropriate.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So. Yeah. So if we do.
Me: Exploring it. Take it out. Weird. But, yeah, it's. You know, I think. I think you know enough about it to. To be able to say. You know, a modern take on an icon isn't the best, but.
Them: No. So, I mean, that's not going to affect performance. Yeah. So I'll look at it anyway. And based on. Based on the asset group itself. I'll have a good idea. If there's any that look quite similar, that actually, I can replace that. So I won't just replace the first three headlines every time. I'll go through and look at all the headlines of which are the most appropriate ones to change.
Me: Yeah. And it's more likely to be the ones towards the back.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: That. Are, you know, from a. From a legacy viewpoint, because I think people just got tired by the time they got there and just whack any old thing.
Them: No, that's. Yeah, just to try and get the score up.
Me: You know, this is. Yeah. And this is a big piece. To do in years to just. Just to do that optimization, see what works and what doesn't work.
Them: Okay? That's okay. That. No, that's absolutely fine. So I'm happy to do that. So I'll manage the internal sheet. And then I will. Just because I'll use that internally to show separate this. Is how we're going to be.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Talking.
Me: And then we can work on this. You know, we can. We can work on this after. After Christmas. And just get this into. Into a place where, you know, you can change stuff in here.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it's going to get implemented, but I can also add my influence to it.
Them: Y.
Me: You know, and I would suggest. Well, I mean, the sale ones are fine. I mean, it's just, you know, up to half selected items. You just. No need to do it.
Them: Es.
Me: You know, don't go over 30 characters on the headlines. The. The rest of it is, you know, it's. It isn't really rocket science when you're doing a.
Them: No, no, it's fine. And that. I mean, that's what I'm. I like money. All. Pay me a sheet because I've got my. Formula in there to tell me when I've gone over. And to be honest, 30 characters is not bloody long either. Like, the amount of times I'm on 31, I think.
Me: Life.
Them: By sake. Okay, well, I think process wise, we're in a good spot then. So I've got some actions on assets. Quite some actions on copy. That's all fine.
Me: Okay? I've got some further testing to do on this this week, just to make sure it will actually pull it in on Tuesday. Because that'll be a pain in the ass if it doesn't. I've got all sorts of backups to. To. To go.
Them: No, that's right. I think that's the, that's the priority. That would be the next priority, obviously, trading through this week and then the switch over from the second and then just in terms of.
Me: There's also the rsas to do as well.
Them: Oh, yeah, I do like an rsa because I get more control.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I enjoy every control over stuff.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So.
Me: The rs. The RSA isn't in that list. It's just the assets. I'm going to have to. I'm going to have to think about that as well. Is how we're going to change the RSAs. This is where the customizers came in really nicely.
Them: Yeah. Because on my paid media copy thing I have got a section where I will fill in an RSA. Ad for copy for UK and one for US. For example, for this 20 off gifts. So I guess for the promos, you're not going to put low again. We're not going to fill it up with. It's just putting a one description, one headline.
Me: I wouldn't even change the descriptions. It's. It is a headliner sale. It's just bang, you know, people aren't going to pass that point. And if he's got underneath, the description will be the. The promotion extension anyway.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Pushing it.
Them: Cool.
Me: But if you've got some. If you've got some wording on the sale, that'd be great, because then I can. I can schedule in the promotion extension to start next, you say the 8th?
Them: Eighth to the fourteenth. Yeah, and I'll have a code as well, but I just need it confirmed. That should be confirmed this week.
Me: Okay? So the countdown timer for Black Friday. Just a wording on that, then.
Them: Right. Yes, I meant to ask. Because I.
Me: No worries. Or you just ping that over whenever and I'll get that set up.
Them: I'll have to check. Yeah, because that was the one where she suggested the headline. It was like, sale ends six days or something, wasn't it? And I said we need to not call it sale, because we don't.
Me: Yeah. And it's just. I don't know. It's Black Friday promotion. Plug. And you. You. You're quite limited. I can't tell you. I can't actually tell you what sort of length that's going to have to be because. It's a. It's a variable, the countdown bit. So just make it as short as you can. I'll put it in and see what it works. Now if it doesn't fit, then I'll let you know, but after I put it into Google Ads to find out whether it's happy with it or not. Because it has to bear in mind how much it's going to expand out because it might be like, sale ends in 23 minutes. Towards the end.
Them: All right. Okay. Yeah. So at the minute, it's quite short because it's just four days, and then when it gets into.
Me: This is not. It'll be that accurate.
Them: Six hours. Right. It's going to end up being. I'll confirm on teams in a minute, but it'll end up being something like.
Me: Yes.
Them: Black Friday ends.
Me: Great. That's the kind of thing.
Them: Black black Friday ends in.
Me: Y.
Them: I mean, because any more than that, you're in danger of running over on the final day anyway, so.
Me: Eah. Yes, you are. But, I mean, sale is great because there's only four letters, but, you know, if that's. If that can't be, then that can't be.
Them: It's only because. Yeah, it's only good. It's more of a political thing.
Me: Yeah, no problem.
Them: Internally.
Me: Because. United discount site, that's why.
Them: Exactly. Exactly. Despite. Despite the messaging.
Me: All the time.
Them: And then I've got one final, final, final thing which you won't like, but I think Seb has given me a bit of a JFDI on it. He would like. 3aspinall targeting. He wants us to do it. I think if we just spent 50 quid a day until Monday.
Me: Okay?
Them: Just to show that it's. It's just because I keep talking to him about it internally.
Me: It's spaffed a load of money away already and it's, doesn't it?
Them: No, no, I know.
Me: I think the thing I disagree with is where it was said that let's do this because it'll force them to back off a little bit. It won't have any effect whatsoever.
Them: I know. Yeah. And that almost. Almost. That's almost a quote. That I put in there.
Me: Really? Well, the. The. The thing that. The thing that we sent over yesterday about Black, about that. And the fact the reason you had an impression sharedrop on brands. Last week is because Lawrence took the budget down from 800 quid to 200 quid. That's why she did it. But. Excuse my French, but. She. She took it down from 800 quid to 200 quid. So it was. The reason was budget. Nothing else at all. We're back up to 98 impression share now.
Them: Yeah, I think it's the overlap rate is the issue as well. So last year,
Me: Yeah, but they will. They will do it.
Them: Well, last year it was only 15% at this time of the year. Now we're I think last seven days last year was 15. Now it's at 75.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, well, that's.
Them: So they've made a conscious.
Me: That's up to them.
Them: So.
Me: Influence that at all.
Them: Oh, no, no, no, no. I know. Apart from, you know. But again, I think this is more of a political decision from.
Me: Right.
Them: Our, you know, Paolo. So whoever obviously pissed off that it's happening. And want us.
Me: How are they measuring what impact that has, though?
Them: I suppose he's looking at from a what's the impact?
Me: He's going on sorrow.
Them: Well, that, but also what's the impact on CPCs? Because obviously CPCs for brand seem to have jumped up quite a bit.
Me: Nothing. Perhaps nothing to do with Aspinall's. Well, it will be to do with Aspinall's, but that's up to them. You know, they quadrupled the CPC's year on year. That's why the brand is so inefficient.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: In their roas. But we can't. We can't change that CPC by going and bidding on someone else's brown. The two things are disconnected completely.
Them: No, I know, I know, I know.
Me: Sorry. I'm just. I'm just.
Them: No, no, no, no. I know that because I've had to kind of go and look at the data. So what he does know is that obviously the C3Cs are increased by x percent and the overlap rate and the competition for the brand keywords, unlike brand exact, for example. Has increased year on year. The CPCs have therefore increased year on year, which means that we're having to spend more money to kind of maintain an impression, share. Rather than doing anything else and put it into non brand. And you're quite right. There's all you can do to influence that. But the pushback I'm getting is, well, I want you to target them. And it is a bit nonsensical in the sense that we're, we're only going to use. But also we're only going to use, for example, 50 quid. A day which is not even going to tickle their feet. Because they'll be spending 1500 pound a day on their own brand.
Me: No.
Them: But.
Me: They're probably spending 1500 quid a day on. On smarting as well, so they're obviously worried and it will be costing them an absolute fortune.
Them: Yeah, but it's. I don't know whether he knows someone aspan on you. It's a personal thing, but it. It's one of those where.
Me: Before with another client. He just wanted me to go get someone else just because he didn't like them.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, so I've just. I've just stopped. Well, not arguing, but I've stopped, kind of. I've just said to him, look, we'll do the. I think the P. Max one probably needs pausing. Because obviously that's just throwing up. This needs to be like a really specifically targeted thing. So I think if we. The smise and search competitor, there's a UK competitor ad group.
Me: Okay? Yeah.
Them: If we. Reactivate this competitor search campaign and only as we had done, only target Aspinall. We've got Aspanol London diaries in there, which I'm not. Entirely sure if we can pause that.
Me: Okay? I added. I had it down for ten quid, but I'll. I'll put it to 50.
Them: Stick. Stick 50 quid on it, and then on Monday I'll go to the meeting.
Me: Go have a budget, though. Mate.
Them: I'll rob. Blame seb. If this is one of those examples internally where you can't win.
Me: No.
Them: Because. You resist doing the thing because it doesn't make sense, but then because you didn't do it. You can't then argue that it didn't work. So.
Me: You could say we spent 300, 313 quid on that. We got seven quid. But how is that ever a good business decision?
Them: Yeah, well, let's do that. Let's do the. That search one, and then.
Me: Well, I've got three keywords in there. Aspen all of London. Aspen of London diaries. Asked me all 2026 diary.
Them: I mean, I don't need the diaries. No. Get rid of Aspinall 20.
Me: Do you want me to do? Just Aspinall.
Them: Yeah, yeah. And it's exact match, isn't it? So I don't know.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Whether I don't know whether people search.
Me: I could have asked in all trade.
Them: Yeah, so that would just be Aspinal, plus anything else.
Me: Yeah. Do that as a phrase match.
Them: Yeah, because there'll be Aspinall. People search for Aspinalls.
Me: Yep.
Them: But. Yeah, yeah, pause the diaries. Related ones. Phrase match on Aspinall. 50 quid a day and then. I'll look at this account on Monday and then we'll say all of the good use of 300 quid, whatever else.
Me: Stop buying mummy.
Them: It's politics. I'll tell you.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And another reason for me not working for somebody rather than me. Yeah. Being me freelance. It just drive me absolutely nuts. I'm glad you're dealing with that end of it.
Them: Yeah, that's the stuff I. I will do. That's the. That's what I bring to the table.
Me: Cool. You're welcome.
Them: Cool. That's all the bits, then. So I'm clear on pbc assets.
Me: Cool.
Them: And what we're doing. So I'll folder them all up, send the links across Google Drive links. All be there for.
Me: For God's sakes. Talk about being connected. Now the phone rings on my. On my computer as well, which is great for talking, but when I'm on a call like this with phone rings and it's my daughter and it's just like, Last order dates.
Them: Yes, I have got them. So they'll come over before lunch as well.
Me: Great stuff.
Them: And I think last year we just put a site link in. To say, you know, I've got. I've got them here, actually. I've got a tab for it in my document delivery cut off site link. Order by 22nd December. Description. I want for delivery by Christmas to trip from line two shop now.
Me: Great.
Them: So I've got all of those. I'll update all the dates.
Me: I presume they're being from last year. Were they?
Them: Yeah, I'll just double check because I have been sent them now.
Me: Okay? Because what I'll also do is put those if you've got. If you got them in text when they're last order date is by country. That'll be fantastic.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely uk, US And Europe, because that all comes out of the Europe one all comes out of European.
Me: Okay? So what I'll be doing then is I will be.
Them: Hub.
Me: Applying that. I'll be using that for the. The budget tracking. Or the the budget prediction so that I can start to pull back on budgets based upon that last order date. So Christmas Christmas gift is one of Christmas gift campaign. If it's they're not going to get it in time so I can stop all on that last order date.
Them: And we have to. No. Yeah, that. That's pretty much what we did last year. It's almost. You almost stop spending entirely. For what would the normal one over there.
Me: Yeah. No problem.
Them: In. It's like if normally like a few days they save the last UK that it was the 22nd and then between the. On the 23rd and up until we put so long on the 24th, we don't really.
Me: Okay?
Them: It's like the two days of the year where there's nothing really to say.
Me: No, that's.
Them: But yeah. So assets.
Me: Well, I've just started factoring in P9. Because that starts next week. So I'm just looking at budgets and stuff and looking at.
Them: I would say usual process.
Me: Like the predictions and stuff for. For sales, when things are going to tail off and all the rest. In that way, the budget is going to fit in with that. Do we have a P10 now? A budget for P10?
Them: So you P10. Google spend a P10 is 14 1.
Me: O. Kay. Right.
Them: And you've got one. 81. 81. For p9.
Me: P9. Yep, yep, no problem.
Them: But bearing in mind as well, obviously, we talked about possibly having a lack of, you know, having sort of front loaded to spend this one. Cyber Monday is p1, is p9.
Me: Yes. Yeah.
Them: So you. Yeah. So you've got.
Me: Yeah. I'm going to leave it. I'm not even going to change the budget on Monday. I don't want to. I don't want to piss about with it at all.
Them: No.
Me: Monday's budget will be what it is. And then hopefully on Tuesday get around to just reassessing the budgets for. For P9. I've started it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Based upon last year's trajectory, which is difficult because of rest of the world not being around at that time. But the rest of the world cut off is going to be before, well, before everybody else, isn't it? So that will need to be factored in as well. So I'm not going to finish. Doing the strategy on P9 until I know what the last order date says.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because that was. It's going to have an impact. Well, I'll factor in that impact on how much it's going to spend.
Them: Yeah. Okay, fine. So I'll send you over last dates. I'll get all these stuff for Tuesday boxed up into folders.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And sent across and then. There's no actions on a copy font for me. On your feet at the moment. The next thing I'll do on that will be for the gifts promo on the 8th.
Me: Okay? Just.
Them: Which I'll do Thursday next week.
Me: So just a quick one from a. From a personal perspective. Well, personal business perspective. This is taking a lot of time. I'm not going to hold you to ransom here on this at all. I know that the situation. I'm not about to increase my. My fee or anything like this. This is taking a massive amount of my time at the moment. Just what it noted. And also, what's the plan for the New year? Do you? I know it's only yesterday she went, but you must have it in your head as to what's likely to be happening.
Them: Well, it'll be a bit. Bit of a coin toss at the moment, to be honest.
Me: Right whether to take it back in house or to leave it as.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And it will depend. It'll depend on when we kind of go out there to.
Me: Yeah.
Them: If there really is nothing. Then I'm not going to do it.
Me: Okay? All right. Okay?
Them: But yeah, I think one thing for us to kind of ever think about over the next days, weeks, etc. Is how do we kind of. Get our. Coalition, your time perspective, how do we kind of protect your time in terms of kind of how we were working over the summer? Or is it just a seasonal thing? Is it because of the seasonality? It's a lot warmer. So how do we switch, you and I, get the balance back to what we had over the summer when we looked?
Me: Yeah. I mean, as. As far as I'm. If I. And this is the. This is the reason for asking the question, because for me, there's loads of projects to do. There's loads of projects to do in that sort of out of season time to get this back into a state of. Even prior to when I first started with you, you know, it all needs sorting out. All the feeds and he's sorting out. There needs to be processes put in place for doing what we're doing now, which is changing text and so on. An organization for the images.
Them: At that.
Me: A strategy going forward, being able to produce forecasts and stuff.
Them: Probably what was happening there because.
Me: There's a lot of. There's a lot of stuff. Off season to be done.
Them: More lines and sound. More bindings as well. They were going to start invisible. They are going to be. We just need to have a check rate and make sure that we're discovered. Shit. And all of that started replacing us in there for the whole rookie room. Step out. Inventory assigned.
Me: Looking at now? I wish that one. But. It is, and there's nothing we can do about it. Right. Now. That's a massive project. So anyway. Okay?
Them: Yeah, no, I hear that. Cool. Okay, let me come back with those actions, then.
Me: All right.
Them: Yeah. Anything else? Ping me. Hopefully it will kind of. It'll be a bit. More streamlined. Let's go with this.
Me: Hopefully. Happy black Friday, mate.
Them: Yeah, you too. I'll speech in a bit. Cheers. By. E.
