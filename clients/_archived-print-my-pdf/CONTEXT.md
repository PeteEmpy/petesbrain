## Key Learnings & Insights

[To be documented from campaign testing]

**Potential Weak Areas** (to avoid or test carefully):
- Generic "printing" terms (too broad, high competition)

- Business card/marketing material terms (different service)

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| 21/10/2025 | Price reduction across services | [Pending] | Monitor conversion rates, AOV, revenue, ROAS post-change |

**Monitoring Required**:

## Notes & Observations

### Data Gaps to Address

**High Priority**:
1. ❌ **Google Ads Account Access**: Account not found in accessible accounts list
   - Action: Verify account exists, check access permissions
   - May need to request access from client or previous agency
2. ❌ **Historical Performance Data**: No performance history available
   - Need at least 6-12 months of data for seasonality analysis
3. ❌ **Budget Information**: No current budget information available
   - Need to establish monthly/daily budget expectations

**Medium Priority**:
1. ⚠️ **Conversion Tracking Audit**: Setup unknown
2. ⚠️ **Target ROAS/CPA**: No current targets documented
3. ⚠️ **Campaign Structure**: Unknown until account accessed

### Next Steps for Account Manager

1. **Immediate**:
   - Locate/request Google Ads account access
   - Review campaign structure and current performance
   - Audit conversion tracking setup
   - Document current budget and targets
   - Establish baseline metrics pre/post price reduction

2. **Within 30 Days**:
   - Analyze 6-12 months of historical performance
   - Identify seasonal patterns
   - Document what's working/not working
   - Create optimization roadmap
   - Schedule regular client check-in

3. **Within 90 Days**:
   - Complete competitive analysis
   - Test new campaign structures if needed
   - Implement recommended optimizations
   - Establish quarterly reporting cadence

### Key Insights from Limited Data

1. **Price Reduction Experiment** (Oct 21, 2025):
   - This is a major business change that will impact Google Ads performance
   - Lower prices may:
     - ✅ Increase conversion rates (more affordable)
     - ✅ Improve ad relevance/quality scores
     - ⚠️ Reduce Average Order Value
     - ⚠️ Require ROAS target adjustments
     - ⚠️ May pressure margins
   - Critical to monitor this closely in coming weeks/months

2. **Niche Market Positioning**:
   - "Ideal if you only want 1 copy" is a strong differentiator
   - This solves a real problem (most printers have minimums)
   - Target audience likely has urgent, one-time needs
   - Consider ad copy emphasizing: one-copy minimum, fast turnaround, quality

3. **Trust Signals**:
   - "100% money back guarantee" is prominently mentioned
   - Should be featured in ad copy and landing pages
   - Reduces purchase anxiety for first-time customers

4. **Limited Communication History**:
   - Only one email on file (from 2022)
   - Suggests either:
     - Low-touch client relationship, or
     - Communications happening elsewhere (phone, other email)
   - May need to establish regular reporting cadence

### Business Model Observations

**Print-on-Demand Characteristics**:
- Low/no inventory risk
- Variable costs per order
- Likely fast fulfillment needed
- Quality consistency critical
- Customer reviews important

**Marketing Implications**:
- Search intent is high (problem-solving searches)
- Likely high CPC competition in printing space
- May benefit from shopping campaigns if product catalog exists
- Remarketing may have limited value (one-time purchases)
- Reviews/testimonials crucial for new customer acquisition

**Seasonal Considerations**:
- Academic calendar likely drives significant volume (thesis/dissertation printing)
- May see spikes: May-June (summer graduations), September-October (fall submissions), November-December (winter graduations)
- Business printing may be steadier year-round
- Personal projects (photo books, etc.) may spike around holidays
