      "notes": "**Priority**: MEDIUM\n**Products Affected**: 6 products with price mismatches\n\n**Issue**: Feed price doesn't match landing page price\n\n**Action Items**:\n1. Access Crowd Control Merchant Center (ID: 563545573)\n2. Identify 6 products with price mismatches\n3. Compare feed price to landing page price\n4. Update feed to match current website price\n   - OR update website if feed price is correct\n\n**Expected Impact**: Restore 6 products\n\n**Reference**: See /tools/product-impact-analyzer/DISAPPROVAL-ACTION-PLAN.md\n\n---\n**MANUAL NOTE (2025-11-20 16:40):**\nThe problem here is that Google is seeing the exclusive VAT price and we're passing through the inclusive VAT price. This is something to do with snippets I think. Further investigation needs doing here. We need to drill down onto the page and look at what the metadata is.\n\n---\n**MANUAL NOTE (2025-11-20 17:15):**\n\n**Page Analysis Completed:**\n\nCompared two products:\n- **A4 Sign Stand** (has issues): https://crowdcontrolcompany.co.uk/shop/210mm-x-297mm-black-a4-sign-stand/\n- **Weathermaster Twin** (working correctly): https://crowdcontrolcompany.co.uk/shop/weathermaster-twin/\n\n**KEY FINDING: Product Type Difference**\n\nBoth pages are missing proper Product schema markup (only have OnlineStore + Organization schemas), BUT:\n\n**A4 Sign Stand (problematic):**\n- Price: £82.80 inc. VAT (feed has correct price)\n- Appears to be a **WooCommerce Variable Product**\n- Variations: Black base, Polished Stainless (+£8), Polished Brass (+£34)\n- Issue: Variable products may show base price (£69 excl. VAT?) + variation prices simultaneously\n\n**Weathermaster Twin (working):**\n- Price: £70.00 (sale) / £84.00 (regular) inc. VAT\n- Product type: **Simple Product** with PPOM add-ons\n- Add-ons: Belt length, custom colors (separate from base price)\n- No price conflict visible to Google\n\n**Next Steps for Tomorrow:**\n1. Check in WooCommerce if A4 Sign Stand is set up as Variable Product\n2. If yes, consider converting to Simple Product with add-ons (like Weathermaster)\n3. Alternative: Ensure only ONE variation price displays at a time\n4. Add proper Product schema markup to all product pages (separate issue but worth fixing)",
