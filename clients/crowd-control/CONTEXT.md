## Strategic Context

### **⭐ CORE STRATEGY: Product Hero Segmentation Framework**

**CRITICAL FOR AUDIT ANALYSIS**: Crowd Control uses the **Product Hero label system** as its primary campaign segmentation strategy. This is NOT traditional product category segmentation.

**What This Means:**
- Campaigns are structured by **performance labels** (Heroes & Sidekicks, Villains, Zombies), not product types
- Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs labels to Google Merchant Center
- Campaign names "Heroes & Sidekicks", "Villains", and "Zombies" refer to Product Hero performance tiers, not product categories
- This strategy is consistent across Connor Heaps businesses (Grain Guard, Go Glean) and other ROK clients

**Analysis Implications:**
- Budget allocation should consider label-based performance patterns (Heroes typically outperform Villains and Zombies)
- Campaign ROAS targets may differ by label tier (Heroes can sustain higher targets than Villains or Zombies)
- Product movement between labels (Hero → Villain → Zombie or reverse) will shift campaign performance
- Traditional product category analysis may miss the performance-based segmentation logic
- Frequent ROAS adjustments (especially on Zombies campaign) reflect label performance dynamics, not seasonal changes

**Product Hero Label System Details:**
- **Heroes & Sidekicks**: Top-performing safety/security products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains**: Underperforming products that drain budget but have optimization potential
- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance (highest risk, lowest ROAS)
- **Plan Level**: Active Product Hero subscription

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Structure**: Performance Max and Shopping campaigns with **Product Hero label segmentation** (all three tiers active)
- **Bidding Strategy**: Target ROAS (170-190% range, with label-specific targets)
- **Key Focus Areas**: Product Hero label optimization (Heroes & Sidekicks, Villains, Zombies), crowd control barrier performance

**Active Campaigns**:
1. "CCC | P Max Heroes & Sidekicks 180 190 26/8 170 14/10" - PMax with target ROAS adjustments
2. "CCC | P Max Shopping | Villains 190 170 14/10" - PMax for Villains product category
3. "CCC | Shopping | Zombies 210 180 24/2 190 17/4 180 5/6 190 26/8 170 14/10" - Shopping campaign with frequent ROAS target adjustments

**Campaign Naming Pattern Analysis**:
- "Heroes & Sidekicks", "Villains", "Zombies" = Product Hero performance labels (not product categories)
- Numbers (170, 180, 190, 210) = Target ROAS percentages
- Dates = When ROAS targets were changed
- Pattern shows frequent optimization and testing

**Product Hero Label System**:
- **Heroes & Sidekicks**: Top-performing products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains**: Underperforming products that drain budget but have potential for improvement
- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance
- Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs labels to Google Merchant Center
- Campaigns are structured around these labels to optimize budget allocation and bidding strategy

### Why This Approach?
**Product Hero Segmentation Strategy**: Using Product Hero label system (same methodology as other ROK clients):
- Automatically classifies products based on performance (Heroes, Sidekicks, Villains, Zombies)
- Allows separate ROAS targets per performance segment
- Optimizes budget allocation toward top performers while managing underperformers
- Enables strategic campaign structure aligned with product performance

**Frequent ROAS Adjustments**: "Zombies" campaign shows 6+ ROAS changes in ~8 months:
- Indicates active optimization and testing
- Possibly seasonal performance variations
- May reflect margin or competition changes

### Goals & KPIs
**Primary Goal**: [TBD - likely ROAS-focused given campaign structure]
**Target ROAS**: 170-210% (varies by campaign, currently trending to 170%)
**Target CPA**: [TBD]
**Other KPIs**: [TBD]

**ROAS Trend Observation**:
- Zombies campaign started at 210% (Feb), reduced to 170% (Oct)
- P Max campaigns also at 170% (Oct)
- Suggests possible market pressure or margin compression requiring lower targets

### Year-Over-Year Trends
[TBD]

### Known Anomalies
**Frequent ROAS Target Changes**: Zombies campaign had 6+ adjustments Feb-Oct 2025
- May indicate testing or response to external factors

### Website & Technical

**Website Platform**: WooCommerce
**Website URL**: https://crowdcontrolcompany.co.uk
**Known Technical Issues**: [TBD]

**Conversion Tracking**:
- **Setup**: **Pixel Manager for WooCommerce Premium** (plugin-based tracking)
- **Plugin**: Pixel Manager for WooCommerce (Premium version)
- **Purpose**: Manages Google Ads conversion tracking, GA4, Facebook Pixel, etc.
- **Critical Note**: This plugin is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for conversion tracking setup. DO NOT manually add gtag.js or other tracking codes - they are managed by this plugin.
- **Known Issues**:
  - October 2025: Only 54% of conversions being reported to Google Ads (£36,910 actual vs £19,745 reported)
  - Attribution gap of £17,164 suggests conversion import failures or tag firing issues
- **Recent Changes** (Nov 4, 2025):
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Previous tracking subscription expired ~2 years ago without notification
  - Old tracking system stopped reporting conversions (explains 54% capture rate)
  - **NEW PLUGIN INSTALLED**: Pixel Manager for WooCommerce Premium (Nov 4, late evening)
  - Purchase Conversion Action configuration updated in new plugin
  - Enhanced Conversions enabled within the plugin
  - **Note**: Will take time for conversions to flow through to Google Ads after new plugin installation
- **Configuration Update** (Nov 10, 2025):
  - ✅ **WooCommerce plugin conversion action set as PRIMARY conversion action**
  - ✅ **GA4 event tracking set as SECONDARY action** (GA4 wasn't working properly)
  - ✅ **Pixel Manager plugin updated** (Nov 10, 2025) - may resolve recent "gla_" product ID prefix issue
  - **Status**: Tracking now properly configured, priority reduced from HIGH to MEDIUM
  - **Next Steps**: Monitor performance to ensure conversions reporting correctly (target: 90%+)
- **Known Product Attribution Issue** (Nov 10, 2025):
  - **Issue**: Product-level conversion attribution mismatch suspected (similar to Godshot's 80% mismatch)
  - **Root Cause**: Recent WooCommerce bug - "gla_" prefix added to Google Shopping feed product IDs doesn't match conversion tracking product IDs
  - **Impact**: Conversions may be attributed to wrong products despite tracking volume correctly
  - **Plugin Update**: Pixel Manager updated Nov 10, 2025 to potentially fix this issue
  - **Review Date**: End of week (Nov 15, 2025) - re-test product attribution accuracy
- **Ongoing Monitoring**:
  - Monitor conversion reporting rate (target: 90%+ vs Oct's 54%)
  - Validate WooCommerce plugin conversions match order data
  - **NEW**: Test product-level attribution accuracy (Google Ads vs WooCommerce product sales)
  - Keep eye on GA4 secondary tracking in case it improves
  - **Check status of refund for incorrectly ordered plugin**
- **Last Audit**: November 4, 2025 - Identified significant underreporting of conversions

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Issues (Nov 2025)

**CRITICAL - Conversion Tracking Failure** (Identified Nov 4, 2025):
- **Root Cause**: Pixel Manager for WooCommerce Premium is only reporting 54% of conversions to Google Ads
- **Impact**: Google Ads shows 162% ROAS, but true ROAS is 303%
- **Evidence**:
  - WooCommerce attributed 140 orders (£36,910) to Google Ads in October 2025
  - Google Ads only reported £19,745 in conversions
  - **£17,164 in conversions missing** from Google Ads (46.5% loss)
- **Smart Bidding Impact**: Algorithm sees poor performance and reduces bids, creating death spiral
- **Status**: URGENT FIX REQUIRED
- **Action Required**:
  1. Audit Pixel Manager for WooCommerce Premium configuration
  2. Check Google Ads conversion action settings
  3. Import missing conversions retroactively (Oct 2025: £17,164)
  4. Monitor conversion reporting daily until stable

**Product Performance Issues** (CTR Collapse):
- Hero products from Oct 2024 ARE selling on website but getting minimal Google Ads traffic
- Product 8025: 19,834 impressions → 24 clicks = 0.12% CTR (catastrophic!)
- Product 6733: 10,526 impressions → 37 clicks = 0.35% CTR
- Product 6735: 17,517 impressions → 132 clicks = 0.75% CTR
- **Note**: Products NOT disapproved, NOT out of stock - issue is ad creative/positioning
- **Action Required**: Review product titles, images, pricing display in Shopping feed

**Offline Conversion Tracking Missing**:
- B2B trade orders (phone, email, repeat buyers) not tracked
- With tracking fixed, reported ROAS should be ~303% (vs current 162%)
- With offline orders added, true ROAS likely 400-500%+
- Status: WooCommerce API credentials obtained (Nov 4, 2025)
- Next Step: Implement offline conversion import for phone/email orders

### Recurring Challenges
**Margin Pressure / Competitive Environment**:
- Frequent ROAS target adjustments (6+ changes in 8 months for Zombies campaign)
- Targets reduced from 180-210% to standardized 170% (Oct 14, 2025)
- Even 170% target not being met (actual: 162%)
- Pattern: Suggests external pressure (competition, costs, or market conditions)

**Campaign Structure Volatility**:
- Multiple campaign structures (PMax + Shopping) for same products
- Recent consolidation (5-7 campaigns → 3) correlated with performance drop
- "Zombies" campaign particularly volatile (6+ ROAS changes Feb-Oct 2025)
- Question: Is volatility strategic testing or reactive firefighting?

**Product Mix Instability**:
- Bestselling products from 2024 disappeared in 2025
- New product categories (hose reels, sign stands) added but can't fill gap
- Category shifts: Core barriers -92%, Signage +208%, Hose Reels +NEW
- Unclear if shifts are strategic or driven by stock/availability issues

### External Factors to Monitor
- Event industry seasonality (festivals, concerts - Spring/Summer heavy)
- Construction season in UK (April-October)
- B2B budget cycles (fiscal year-end exhaustion in Oct?)
- Safety regulations and compliance requirements
- Competitive landscape in crowd control equipment sector

- Category-wide collapse: Barricades -92%, Wall Mounts -86%, Bundles -77%

❌ **Campaign Consolidation Strategy** (Aug-Oct 2025):
- Reduced from 5-7 active campaigns to 3 active
- Paused campaigns: 19706759481, 20090724151
- Result: -37% impressions, -48% clicks, -68% revenue
- Verdict: Over-consolidation hurt performance

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Oct 14, 2025 | All campaigns standardized to 170% ROAS target | **Failed** - Achieved only 162% ROAS, conv rate dropped 48% | Need to reassess target strategy |
| Aug-Oct 2025 | Campaign consolidation (5-7 → 3 campaigns) | **Failed** - Revenue dropped 68% YoY | Consider re-enabling paused campaigns |

**Observed Tests** (from campaign names):
- Zombies ROAS targets: 210% → 180% → 190% → 180% → 190% → 170%
- Heroes & Sidekicks ROAS: 180% → 190% → 170%
- Pattern: Continuous reduction suggests margin pressure or competitive changes
- Oct 14, 2025: All campaigns converged to 170% (strategic shift)

## Product Hero Settings

### Current Configuration (Last Updated: 2025-10-14)

**Product Hero Plan**: Pro Plan (€30/month)

**Campaign ROAS Targets** (All converged to 170% on Oct 14, 2025):
- **Heroes & Sidekicks**: 170%
- **Villains**: 170%
- **Zombies**: 170%

**Convergence Event**: Oct 14, 2025 - All three campaigns adjusted to unified 170% ROAS target

**Rationale**: Strategic decision to standardize ROAS targets across all Product Hero label segments. All campaigns reduced from varying levels (180-210%) to unified 170% target, suggesting volume-driven strategy or market adjustment.

**Related Methodology**: [Product Hero Labelizer System](/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain.nosync/roksys/knowledge-base/rok-methodologies/product-hero-labelizer-system.md)

### Settings Change History

| Date | Campaign | Setting | Previous | New | Rationale | Result |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-14 | Heroes & Sidekicks | ROAS | 190% | 170% | Unified target across campaigns | Current target |
| 2025-10-14 | Villains | ROAS | 190% | 170% | Unified target across campaigns | Current target |
| 2025-10-14 | Zombies | ROAS | 190% | 170% | Unified target across campaigns | Current target |
| 2025-08-26 | Heroes & Sidekicks | ROAS | 180% | 190% | Performance improvement | Reduced to 170% Oct 14 |
| 2025-08-26 | Zombies | ROAS | 180% | 190% | Performance improvement | Reduced to 170% Oct 14 |
| 2025-06-05 | Zombies | ROAS | 190% | 180% | Mid-year adjustment | Increased back to 190% Aug 26 |
| 2025-04-17 | Zombies | ROAS | 180% | 190% | Spring adjustment | Reduced to 180% Jun 5 |
| 2025-02-24 | Zombies | ROAS | [TBD] | 210% | Initial high target | Progressive reduction began |

**Note**: Product Hero automatically classifies products daily as Heroes/Sidekicks/Villains/Zombies based on performance. These labels sync to Google Merchant Center and guide campaign structure. Target ROAS settings control the algorithm's bidding aggressiveness. Part of Connor Heaps portfolio (consistent with Go Glean, Grain Guard).
