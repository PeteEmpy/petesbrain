## [2025-12-11] Shopping Campaign Test: Belt Barrier & Floor Stand Focus

**Hypothesis**: A dedicated Shopping campaign focused specifically on posts and panels (10-pack belt barriers, floor sign stands) will convert better than generic product feed listings in PMax.

**Background**: Investigation revealed posts/panels are getting 72k impressions and 533 clicks (0.60% CTR) but 0% ROAS - conversions not being tracked due to outdated WooCommerce/GA4 integration.

**Test Design**:
- **Experiment Type**: Shopping campaign (new)
- **Products**: 
  - Belt Barrier 10 Pack
  - Floor Sign Stand (A3/A4)
- **Duration**: 7 days (2025-12-11 to 2025-12-18)
- **Goal**: Establish baseline conversion tracking before broader scaling
- **Success Metric**: Any conversions recorded = tracking working; ROAS >100%

**Status**: ACTIVE - Created 2025-12-11

**Next Review**: 2025-12-18 (7 days)
