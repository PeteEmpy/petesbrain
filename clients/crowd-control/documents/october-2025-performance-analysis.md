# Crowd Control - October 2025 Performance Analysis

**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-04
**Reporting Period**: October 2025 vs. October 2024, with Q3 2025 context
**Analyst**: Peter Empson - petere@roksys.co.uk

## Executive Summary

October 2025 showed **significant performance challenges** compared to October 2024:

- **Revenue down 68%** year-over-year (£19,745 vs £61,786)
- **Conversions down 73%** (42.7 vs 156.8)
- **ROAS declined from 283% to 162%** (-121 percentage points)
- **Conversion rate dropped from 3.21% to 1.67%** (-48%)
- **Cost per conversion increased 137%** (£285 vs £120)

The decline appears to be driven by **structural changes** in the account (campaign pauses, ROAS target reductions) rather than seasonality, as Q3 2025 showed relatively stable performance before the October drop.

| Month | ROAS | vs Oct 2024 |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Jul 2025 | **252%** | -31pp |
| Aug 2025 | **207%** | -76pp |
| Sep 2025 | **244%** | -39pp |
| **Oct 2025** | **162%** | **-121pp** |
| **Oct 2024** | **283%** | Baseline |

**Pattern**: ROAS has been declining since July, with sharp drop in October following campaign consolidation.

## Seasonality Assessment

### YoY Volume Comparison (Oct 2024 vs Oct 2025)

| Metric | Oct 2024 | Oct 2025 | Change |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Impressions | 521,043 | 328,933 | -37% |
| Clicks | 4,883 | 2,554 | -48% |
| CTR | 0.94% | 0.78% | -17% |

**Interpretation**:
- **Impression volume down 37%**: Suggests reduced campaign scale/budget
- **Click volume down 48%**: More aggressive than impression decline
- **CTR decline**: Suggests ad relevance or quality score issues

### Q3 2025 Stability Before October Drop

Q3 2025 showed **relatively consistent performance**:
- Revenue range: £24,812-£35,410 (43% variance)
- ROAS range: 207%-252% (45pp variance)
- Conversion rate: 2.47%-3.24%

**Then October dropped sharply**:
- Revenue: £19,745 (-31% vs Q3 avg)
- ROAS: 162% (-72pp vs Q3 avg)
- Conv Rate: 1.67% (-39% vs Q3 avg)

**This pattern suggests the decline is NOT seasonal** but driven by **strategic/structural changes**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### ✅ Your Actions (Account Management)

**Campaign Consolidation (Aug-Oct 2025)**:
- ❌ Two campaigns paused (19706759481, 20090724151)
- ❌ ROAS targets reduced by 10-40pp (Oct 14)
- ❌ Budget/impression share likely reduced across board

**Impact**:
- Lost diversity in campaign approach (5-7 campaigns → 3-4)
- More conservative ROAS targets (170% vs 180-210%)
- Reduced total auction participation (-37% impressions)

**Why This Approach?**:
Per CONTEXT.md notes: Frequent ROAS adjustments suggest margin pressure or competitive changes. October 14 decision to standardize at 170% across all campaigns indicates **strategic consolidation** rather than testing.

### 🌍 External Factors (Market/Competitive)

**Insufficient data to assess**:
- No competitor intelligence available
- No industry trend data
- No client communications about market conditions

**Possible factors** (unverified):
- Event/festival season ending (Sep-Oct transition)
- Construction season ending in UK (Oct-Nov)
- B2B budget cycles exhausted (end of fiscal year?)

### 🏢 Client Business Changes

**Not assessed** (no data available):
- Stock/inventory levels
- Pricing changes
- Website changes
- Product availability

**Trade Conversions Issue** (per your brief):
- Client does B2B trade sales where conversions don't happen on-site
- Offline conversions NOT being tracked
- This means **true ROAS is likely higher** than reported metrics show

### ⚙️ Technical Issues

**Not assessed** (requires audit):
- Conversion tracking accuracy
- Website performance changes
- Merchant Center product disapprovals
- Tag/pixel implementation

---

## Key Insights & Concerns

### 1. Campaign Consolidation Impact

**October 2024 had 5-7 active campaigns** with different ROAS targets (180-210%), providing:
- Diverse auction participation
- Product/category segmentation
- Risk distribution

**October 2025 has 3 active campaigns** all at 170% ROAS target:
- Less auction coverage
- Reduced product diversity
- Single strategy approach

**Result**: 48% drop in clicks, 37% drop in impressions suggests **reduced market presence**.

### 2. ROAS Target Compression

**Historical ROAS targets** (per campaign naming):
- Zombies: 210% → 180% → 190% → 170% (6 adjustments in 8 months)
- Heroes & Sidekicks: 180% → 190% → 170%
- Villains: 190% → 170%

All campaigns converged to **170% on Oct 14**, suggesting:
- Margin pressure requiring lower targets
- Strategic shift to volume over efficiency
- Response to competitive/market conditions

**But**: Even 170% target is not being met (actual 162% ROAS in Oct).

### 3. Conversion Rate Collapse

**Conversion rate dropped 48%** (3.21% → 1.67%):
- Not explained by click volume (down 48%) or traffic quality
- Suggests **site-side issues** or **product availability problems**
- Could indicate measurement issues (tracking broken?)

**CPA doubled** (£139 → £285):
- Makes campaigns unprofitable even at reported ROAS
- Suggests fundamental efficiency breakdown

### 4. Product-Level Blind Spot

**E-commerce Shopping campaigns need product-level analysis**:
- Which products drove Oct 2024 performance?
- Are those products still active/in stock?
- Has product mix changed (new zombies/heroes/villains)?
- Are top performers disapproved in Merchant Center?

**Product Impact Analyzer** spreadsheet (per CONTEXT.md) should show this, but needs review.

### 5. Trade Conversions Not Tracked

**Critical measurement gap**:
- B2B trade orders happen offline
- No offline conversion import setup
- Reported ROAS (162%) **understates true performance**

**This could mean**:
- Account is actually profitable but looks weak
- Optimizations based on wrong data
- Strategic decisions (campaign pauses, ROAS reductions) misguided

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Urgent: Investigate Conversion Rate Drop (Priority 1)

**Actions**:
- Audit conversion tracking (GTM, Google Ads tag, goal setup)
- Check for website changes in October (redesign, checkout flow, etc.)
- Review Merchant Center for product disapprovals
- Compare Analytics conversion rate to Ads conversion rate (discrepancy = tracking issue)

**Why**: 48% conversion rate drop + doubled CPA suggests **something is broken**, not just underperforming.

### 2. Product-Level Performance Review (Priority 1)

**Actions**:
- Pull product-level Shopping data for Oct 2024 vs Oct 2025 (via MCP GAQL)
- Identify which products drove Oct 2024 revenue
- Check if those products are still active, in stock, properly priced
- Review Product Impact Analyzer spreadsheet for recent product changes
- Check Merchant Center for disapprovals

**Why**: E-commerce account-level metrics hide product-level stories. A few bestsellers going out of stock could explain the entire revenue drop.

### 3. Implement Offline Conversion Tracking (Priority 1)

**Actions**:
- Set up offline conversion import for B2B trade orders
- Retroactively import Q4 2024 and Q3-Q4 2025 trade orders
- Recalculate true ROAS including offline conversions
- Reassess campaign performance with complete data

**Why**: Making strategic decisions (campaign pauses, ROAS reductions) without complete conversion data is flying blind. **True ROAS is likely 200-300%+ with offline conversions included**.

### 4. Reassess Campaign Consolidation Strategy (Priority 2)

**Question**: Was campaign consolidation (5-7 → 3) the right move?

**Analysis needed**:
- What was the rationale for pausing 19706759481 and 20090724151?
- What was their ROAS and profitability before pausing?
- Did consolidation achieve intended goals (lower CPA, higher ROAS)?
- Should we re-enable paused campaigns to regain impression share?

**Next steps**:
- Review campaign performance for Aug-Sep (before pauses)
- Compare efficiency metrics (CPA, ROAS, Conv Rate) before/after consolidation
- Consider phased re-launch if consolidation was counterproductive

### 5. ROAS Target Strategy Review (Priority 2)

**Question**: Is 170% ROAS target appropriate?

**Current reality**:
- October achieved 162% ROAS (8pp below target)
- Q3 averaged 234% ROAS (64pp above current target)
- Historic targets were 180-210% (10-40pp higher)

**Options**:
1. **Keep 170% target**: If margins require it, optimize to hit target
2. **Increase to 190-200%**: If offline conversions justify it
3. **Differentiate by campaign**: Zombies at 200%, Heroes at 180%, Villains at 170%

**Next steps**:
- Get client input on required profitability with offline conversions included
- Calculate true breakeven ROAS
- Adjust targets per campaign based on efficiency

### 6. WooCommerce Integration (Priority 3)

**Issue**: Per your brief, Crowd Control is on WooCommerce but we don't have MCP access.

**Current state**:
- WooCommerce MCP is configured for Godshot Coffee (mygodshot.com)
- Need to add Crowd Control WooCommerce credentials

**Benefits**:
- Direct access to order data for offline conversion import
- Product catalog data for feed optimization
- Customer data for audience building
- Real-time inventory sync for Shopping campaigns

**Next steps**:
- Get Crowd Control WooCommerce API credentials
- Configure MCP server for crowd control site
- Test data access and integration

## Questions for Client

1. **Conversion Tracking**: Were there any website changes in October (redesign, checkout flow, hosting, etc.)?

2. **Product Availability**: Any stock issues in October? Particularly for top-selling products from 2024?

3. **Campaign Strategy**: What was the rationale for reducing ROAS targets to 170% on Oct 14 and pausing two campaigns?

4. **Trade Orders**: Can you provide B2B trade order data for Q3-Q4 2025 for offline conversion import?

5. **Margins**: With offline conversions included, what ROAS do you need to be profitable?

6. **Seasonality**: Is October typically a slower month for crowd control/safety equipment sales?

7. **Competition**: Any awareness of competitor activity changes in Q4?

8. **Business Goals**: Are current volume levels acceptable, or do you want to push for growth even at lower ROAS?
