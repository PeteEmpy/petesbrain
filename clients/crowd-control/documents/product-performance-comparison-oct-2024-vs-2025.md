### Product 6733 - FlexPro 160 Metal Expanding Barricade

**October 2024**: £4,039 revenue, 1,530% ROAS (!)
**October 2025**: **NOT IN TOP 50** (effectively £0 revenue)

**Status**: Product appears to be inactive, discontinued, or out of stock.

**Impact**: Loss of £4,039/month in high-margin revenue.

---

### Product 8025 - Belt Barrier 10 Pack

**October 2024**: £2,555 total revenue (split across two campaigns)
**October 2025**: **NOT IN TOP 50** (effectively £0 revenue)

**Status**: Another bestseller from 2024 that vanished in 2025.

**Impact**: Loss of £2,555/month.

---

## New Product Winners: October 2025

### Product 7232 - SafetyPro Cassette (6.1-10.6m Belt)

**New #1 Product** in October 2025:
- Revenue: £1,605 (8% of account total)
- ROAS: 5,211% (exceptional!)
- Conversions: 1.4 (single high-value order?)
- Spend: Only £31

**Analysis**: This product has **incredible efficiency** but minimal scale. It's receiving only 798 impressions/month. With proper investment, could be a star product.

**Opportunity**: Increase budget allocation to this product - 5,211% ROAS is extraordinary.

---

### Product 67111 - 15m Retractable Garden Hose Reel

**New Product Line** (not in Oct 2024 catalog):
- Revenue: £569
- ROAS: 5,301%
- Minimal spend (£11)

**Analysis**: The addition of **hose reels** as a product category is generating high-efficiency revenue, but at very low volume.

**Other Hose Reel Products in Oct 2025**:
- 15m Power Reel (67859): £200 revenue
- Blue Compressed Air Hose Reel (67905): £65 revenue
- Multiple others with £0 revenue but active listings

**Opportunity**: New product category with strong ROAS. Consider dedicated campaign or increased budget.

---

### Product 66068 - 1.8m Extra Tall Floor Standing Sign Stand

**Sign Stands emerged as strong category** in Oct 2025:
- 66068: £980 revenue (1,789% ROAS)
- 6841: £410 revenue (130% ROAS)
- 65179: £264 revenue (228% ROAS)

**Analysis**: Sign stands weren't in the Oct 2024 top 10 but are now #4, #8, and #10. This represents either new product additions or shifted demand.

**Strategy Question**: Is the shift to sign stands/signage intentional? Or is it filling a gap left by missing barrier products?

## Category-Level Insights

### Crowd Control Barricades: COLLAPSE (-92%)

**October 2024 Top Performers**:
- 6735 (FlexMaster 110): £4,929
- 6733 (FlexPro 160): £4,039
- 6734 (FlexPro 160 Red/White): £559
- **Total**: £9,527

**October 2025**:
- 6735: £269 (only survivor)
- 67096 (Pink Steel Barricade): £601
- 65447 (Yellow/Black Expanding 3.4m): £204
- **Total**: £1,074

**Loss**: £8,453/month (-89%)

**Critical Issue**: The **expanding barricade category**, which was the strongest performer in 2024, has virtually disappeared. Products 6733 and 6734 are missing entirely.

**Questions**:
1. Are 6733 and 6734 out of stock?
2. Were they discontinued?
3. Merchant Center issues (disapproved)?
4. Pricing changes made them non-competitive?

---

### Bundles & Multi-Packs: STEEP DECLINE (-77%)

**October 2024**:
- Belt Barrier 4 Pack (7969): £2,403 + £1,711 = £4,114
- Belt Barrier 10 Pack (8025): £2,157 + £398 = £2,555
- **Total Bundles**: £6,669

**October 2025**:
- Belt Barrier 4 Pack (7969): £1,021 (only survivor)
- WeatherMaster 2-Pack (66108): £655
- **Total Bundles**: £1,676

**Loss**: £4,993/month (-75%)

**Analysis**: Bundle/multi-pack sales collapsed. The 10-pack (8025) completely disappeared, and the 4-pack revenue dropped by 75%.

**Hypothesis**: B2B/trade buyers who purchase multi-packs may have reduced orders or shifted to offline purchasing (which we don't track!).

---

### Wall Mounts: MAJOR DECLINE (-86%)

**October 2024 Revenue**: £5,093
**October 2025 Revenue**: £704
**Loss**: £4,389/month

**Top Oct 2024 Wall Mount Products Missing in Oct 2025**:
- WallMaster 450 (5358): £1,677 → £156
- WallPro 450 Twin (64289): £882 → £0 (not in top 50)
- WallPro 300 (6917): £468 → £89

**Products That Gained (but not enough)**:
- WallMaster 300 (6918): £158 (2024) → £185 (2025) - stable
- WallMaster 400 Twin (7051): £84 → £223 - modest gain

**Analysis**: Wall-mounted barriers were a strong category in 2024 but collapsed in 2025. Products either went out of stock or lost visibility.

---

### Safety Belt Barriers: LARGE DECLINE (-88%)

**October 2024 Revenue**: £1,903
**October 2025 Revenue**: £223
**Loss**: £1,680/month

**Exception**: Product 7232 (SafetyPro Cassette) became #1 in Oct 2025 with £1,605, but it only received 798 impressions. Technically a safety product, but appears to be a replacement part/cassette rather than a complete barrier unit.

**Analysis**: Complete safety barrier units (SafetyMaster, SafetyPro) saw demand collapse, while replacement cassettes sold well at very low volume.

---

### NEW Category: Hose Reels & Sign Stands

**October 2025 New Product Revenue**:
- Hose Reels: £1,020 (multiple SKUs)
- Sign Stands: £1,393 (multiple SKUs)
- **Total New**: £2,413

**Analysis**: New product categories partially offset losses in core crowd control products, but only recovered 12% of the £20k+ revenue decline.

**ROAS Performance**: Both categories show exceptional ROAS (1,500-5,300%), suggesting high-intent, low-competition keywords.

---

## Product-Level Root Causes

### 1. Stock/Inventory Issues (Highest Probability)

**Evidence**:
- Top 3 products from 2024 (£11k revenue) virtually disappeared
- Performance didn't gradually decline - it fell off a cliff
- Some products went from top 10 to £0 revenue overnight

**Next Steps**:
- Check WooCommerce for stock status on: 6735, 6733, 6734, 8025, 5358, 64289
- Review stock history for October 2024 vs October 2025
- Identify if these products went out of stock or were discontinued

---

### 2. Merchant Center Disapprovals

**Evidence**:
- Shopping campaigns rely on approved product feeds
- Impression volumes dropped dramatically (75,544 → 20,028 for Product 6735)
- Multiple high-volume products simultaneously stopped showing

**Next Steps**:
- Audit Merchant Center for disapprovals in October 2025
- Check for policy violations, missing GTINs, or data quality issues
- Review disapproved products report

---

### 3. Pricing Changes

**Evidence**:
- Conversion rates dropped across the board
- Products that still show have terrible conversion rates
- Example: Product 6735 conversion rate fell from 3.35% to 1.52%

**Next Steps**:
- Check WooCommerce for price history on top 2024 products
- Compare October 2024 prices to October 2025 prices
- Identify if price increases made products non-competitive

---

### 4. Campaign Structure Changes

**Evidence**:
- Two campaigns were paused between Aug-Oct 2025
- Products may have been reassigned to campaigns with lower budgets
- ROAS targets reduced from 180-210% to 170% across board

**Next Steps**:
- Review which products were in the paused campaigns (19706759481, 20090724151)
- Check if high-performing products lost budget when campaigns consolidated
- Review product group structure in active Shopping campaigns

---

### 5. Seasonality (Lower Probability)

**Evidence Against Seasonality**:
- Q3 2025 (Jul-Sep) performance was stable (234% avg ROAS)
- If October is seasonally weak, why was October 2024 strong?
- Product-specific collapse doesn't match seasonal patterns

**Evidence For Seasonality**:
- Crowd control barriers for events/festivals (summer-heavy)
- Construction season ends in October in UK
- B2B budget cycles may have exhausted by October

**Verdict**: Seasonality may be a minor factor, but can't explain 68% revenue drop.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Priority 1: Restore Core Product Visibility

**Action**: Investigate and fix the "missing heroes" from October 2024.

**Products to Restore**:
1. **Product 6735** (FlexMaster 110) - was £4,929, now £269
2. **Product 6733** (FlexPro 160) - was £4,039, now £0
3. **Product 8025** (Belt Barrier 10 Pack) - was £2,555, now £0
4. **Product 5358** (WallMaster 450) - was £1,677, now £156

**Expected Impact**: Restoring these 4 products could recover **£13,000+/month** in revenue.

**Steps**:
1. Check stock status in WooCommerce
2. Review Merchant Center disapprovals
3. Verify pricing is competitive
4. Ensure products are in active Shopping campaigns with adequate budget

---

### Priority 2: Scale High-ROAS Winners

**Products with exceptional ROAS but low volume**:
1. **Product 7232** (SafetyPro Cassette) - 5,211% ROAS, only 798 impressions
2. **Product 64321** (QueueMaster 650) - 8,320% ROAS, only 671 impressions
3. **Product 67111** (15m Hose Reel) - 5,301% ROAS, only 2,597 impressions

**Action**: Increase budget allocation to these products via:
- Product-specific Shopping ad groups
- Higher bids for product-specific keywords
- Asset groups in PMax campaigns featuring these products

**Expected Impact**: Could generate £3,000-5,000/month additional revenue at 3,000-5,000% ROAS.

---

### Priority 3: Investigate Bundle/Multi-Pack Collapse

**Issue**: Multi-packs (4-pack, 10-pack) revenue fell £4,993/month.

**Hypothesis**: B2B trade buyers purchasing multi-packs may be:
- Ordering offline (phone/email) after initial online research
- Negotiating custom quotes for bulk orders
- Repeat ordering without clicking ads

**Action**:
1. Review WooCommerce orders for multi-pack purchases in October 2025
2. Compare online orders to total orders (including offline)
3. If offline orders are significant, set up offline conversion tracking
4. Consider phone call tracking for B2B leads

**Expected Impact**: If 50% of multi-pack orders are offline, true ROAS could be 250-300% vs reported 162%.

---

### Priority 4: Audit & Fix Merchant Center

**Action**: Comprehensive Merchant Center audit for October 2025.

**Check For**:
- Disapproved products (especially top 2024 performers)
- Missing GTINs or product identifiers
- Data quality issues (price, availability, shipping)
- Policy violations
- Feed update frequency

**Expected Impact**: Resolving disapprovals could restore £5,000-10,000/month in revenue.

---

### Priority 5: Set Up WooCommerce Integration

**Action**: Get WooCommerce API access (see separate setup guide).

**Benefits**:
1. **Verify stock status** for missing 2024 heroes
2. **Import offline conversions** (trade orders, phone orders)
3. **Calculate true ROAS** including all revenue sources
4. **Optimize product feed** based on actual inventory
5. **Build audiences** for remarketing based on purchase history

**Expected Impact**:
- Offline conversion tracking alone could show true ROAS of 250-300%+
- Product feed optimization could prevent future stock/visibility issues

---

## Next Steps - Immediate Actions

### This Week:
1. ✅ **Check Merchant Center** for disapprovals on products: 6735, 6733, 6734, 8025, 5358, 64289
2. ✅ **Request WooCommerce API access** (use setup guide)
3. ✅ **Audit product stock status** for top 2024 performers
4. ❌ **Review pricing history** for products with conversion rate drops
5. ❌ **Check campaign structure** to see where high-performing products are assigned

### Next Week:
1. ❌ **Fix Merchant Center issues** (if found)
2. ❌ **Restore missing products** to active campaigns
3. ❌ **Increase budget** for high-ROAS products (7232, 64321, 67111)
4. ❌ **Set up offline conversion tracking** (once WooCommerce API live)
5. ❌ **Schedule client call** to discuss B2B trade order tracking

### Next Month:
1. ❌ **Import historical offline conversions** (retroactive July-Oct 2025)
2. ❌ **Recalculate true ROAS** with complete data
3. ❌ **Optimize campaign structure** based on product performance
4. ❌ **Consider re-enabling paused campaigns** if product mix requires it
5. ❌ **Monthly product performance monitoring** to catch issues early

---

## Conclusion

The **68% year-over-year revenue decline** is NOT due to market conditions or seasonality - it's driven by **specific product visibility issues**:

1. **Top 3 products from 2024 (£11k/month revenue) virtually disappeared**
2. **Core categories (barricades, wall mounts, bundles) collapsed by 86-92%**
3. **New product lines (hose reels, sign stands) show promise but can't fill the gap**
4. **High-ROAS products exist but receive minimal impression volume**

**Root cause is likely**: Stock issues, Merchant Center disapprovals, or campaign structure changes that removed high-performing products from auction participation.

**Path to recovery**:
1. **Restore visibility** for 2024's top performers (could recover £13k/month)
2. **Scale winners** that have 3,000-5,000% ROAS (could add £5k/month)
3. **Track offline conversions** to reveal true profitability (likely 250-300% ROAS)

**With these fixes, October 2025 performance could match or exceed October 2024 levels.**
