Meeting Title: Meeting with Rob Bulcock - GetBoardwise
Date: Oct 29
Transcript:
Me: Yes. Be more granular. I started it through. Granola, but I don't think I hit the record on the bottom left hand corner. There is already an apps script which we wrote. A while ago. To do this. Can this be adapted? Hey.  
Them: Yeah. Good afternoon. Peter.  
Me: It helps you put my audio video on, doesn't it?  
Them: How are you? Doing?  
Me: Yeah, some good. Thank you.  
Them: Yeah. Really? Well, thank you. Really well. How's your recording? In progress.  
Me: Yeah, it's pretty good. It's been a learning week.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: As soon as you get into AI, your brain gets blown. And this week it's blown it.  
Them: I won't even know where to start with it. So much going on. Constantly changing and evolving.  
Me: Yeah, there is, and it's interesting. That I have 10, 12 clients who I do paid search management for. And I don't actually have a business I could sell because it's just me. So basically, I'm putting it all into AI and all the information I know and all the information I know about my clients into AI so that you can use that to make decisions. It's fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. I'm still a geek at heart.  
Them: I imagine how Doing it all via that now. It's impressive. Impressive for sure.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: For me. I'll give you a loose agenda of, you know, sort of the column, what we're going to discuss. So I'll go through us, as a business, who it is we work with. We'll touch a bit on your capacity, a bit about what you're currently doing and a little bit. More detail, and then I'll talk you through our process in terms of how that works. Some more proactive approach in terms of what we do, purely because we see the biggest challenge as being visibility in this space.  
Me: Cool. Process. What we. Do. Because we. Think.  
Them: In terms of board and non exec positions. So what we through, how we do that, maybe it's quite similar to what you're currently doing as well. But I'll go for it all with yourself, you see if it's a good fit for you. So in terms of business, what we do, we help experience non executives and board advisors. Carefully expand their portfolios. And on the flip side, we also support senior execs and consultants taking their first steps into this non exec space.  
Me: That.  
Them: So our job as a business is to connect you with the right decision makers, helping you secure some high value opportunities. At the moment, we work alongside some of the leading names, so we work with Board Agenda, which is the UK's top governance publication. We work with the James Annes Group, we work with Techlin for boards and recently we've been recognized by the ALECA Bank Awards and a British Business Awards as well. To be fully transparent, obviously found your information just via LinkedIn. In terms of positions you've held, what you've currently done in the past.  
Me: 's. Obvious.  
Them: And was the reason for reaching out. So, firstly, I just wanted to understand a bit more about your capacity, whether you'd have a couple days per month to be able to commit to a new role. Just briefly on a bit of your experience, if you don't mind telling me a bit more about that as well.  
Me: Okay? I mean, capacity wise, yes, you probably do have a couple of days per month. Depending what that commitment would be, whether it's remote or on site. Do people still go into offices?  
Them: Typically, it is a remote hybrid to be fully transparent.  
Me: Right. Okay. Yeah. I have about 10 clients at the moment for whom I do pay to search management, typically Google Ads. But because of my experience, I also bring a lot more to the client in terms of my experience with ecommerce.  
Them: Ok?  
Me: So my background is, you're too young for this. But I started off with programming. So like linear third generation programming, which led to the Y2K issue in the year 2000, where the planes were to fall out the sky because of the date changes. I broke that in the first place, and then I went freelance. From a software house programming role to become a consultant to do programming, to fix that kind of thing, that sort of language. Died of death really early 2000s, but prior to that I recognized that the fact of there was an opportunity on the Internet for ecommerce. So I set up a business with a partner who had a hi fi business. Hi Fi and Home Cinema and for five years ran an ecom business selling that kind of stuff. We took the business to 5 million a year. So that's where I learned my trade as far as digital marketing is concerned, because I was actually running it for my own business when I left there. I was then head on to buy a gift company, an ecommerce gift company called Getting Personal and I worked with them for five years. Started off doing paid search, but then kind of around the marketing department and eventually left. It was quite interesting why I left it, and it's quite contrary to what we're talking about, is they wanted me to go into the boardroom. I was still happy getting my hands dirty. That's what I like doing. I like getting into the weeds of things and learning all the time. I didn't want to be a yes man. In the boardroom, so left there and started my own business, which is what I do now, which is an agency. I say an agency, it is just me. And as I say, I have 10 clients, typically Seme sorry, but have some big clients like Smithson's. I've had Joe Brown's in the past. I really don't know whether you'd know the names or not, but you've seen them on my LinkedIn profile.  
Them: 10. Yeah, exactly.  
Me: So I enjoy taking businesses on this ecommerce journey because I do appreciate there are a lot of. Shysters out there. The difference that I bring to the party is that I've been there and done it and helping people not reinvent the wheel, really. We can shortcut a lot of things and create a nice tech stack for them as well. Of products which will help them achieve their goals and achieve the profits that they want.  
Them: That's nice. Like a line's nicely as well. Do you mind me asking alongside that, are you working on any new opportunities currently within this space, outside of the space, which may change the capacity that you've got?  
Me: Always.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I'm freelance. At the end of the day, if someone came along. Someone spoke to me today about another opportunity. Just another client. Just onboarding another client. I flex my time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Well, I say flex my time. I expand my time and contract my time depending on the clients that I've got. I have no desire yet to retire. That may happen in next four or five years.  
Them: Y.  
Me: But as far as my clients are concerned, I've never found it difficult.  
Them: Eah.  
Me: To accommodate people. It's always difficult to know how much time you're working on one client and another client, because at the end of the day, what people are buying into is the tech that you know, the techniques that you know when you're learning it for all of them.  
Them: Perfect. You're only asking in terms of your freelance. You do at the moment. How would you generate clients with that? Is that through word of mouth and referrals? Do they like.  
Me: Yeah, those. Two. You know what, Robert? I've never actually gone out. Really. In search for clients, they've always come to me. I obviously have some sort of reputation out there and people are happy with it. So I've been on bark a couple of times. I've got a couple of clients with bark.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: They're usually. Difficult. I have found a couple that have been ok, but that's the only outreach, really, I've done.  
Them: That's fine. I appreciate that. Okay, let me. Let me go ahead and explain how we worked. As I say, we are different from job boards and recruitment, so the biggest challenge we identify in the market is just visibility. So 90% of these non exec or board roles, they just rarely advertise anywhere. The ones that we see advertised. Usually very niche. Some sort of compliance role or public sector role? Both. With 100, if not thousands of applicants on them, more often than not, it aligns with where you're at, the clients that you've worked with before. Referrals, social circles, personal networks, is more often than not where these opportunities are going to come from. So we look at what we can control. And if you don't have a powerful personal network or at least a proactive approach, potentially your options, they're going to be limited within the space. So in order to obviously build a portfolio GRA this commercially sustainable. And tailored what you're actually interested in. You need a bit of consistent outreach. That's what we do as a business. So we proactively contact business leaders, CEOs, chairs and founders on your behalf when their business is going to a formal transition. Whether that's positive or negative transition, nine times out of 10, if they are going through that, they're going to be looking for someone like yourself with that experience to help them go through that. In which we do it is we take your criteria. In terms of industries, geographical locations, revenue size. Funded, stage scaling listed businesses. You decide what is you want to explore. We'll build a campaign to find it and we'll put you in front of the right opportunities as they're going through some form of transitional phase. So what I'll do is I'll share my screen. I'll show you how it works for our clients. I'll show you some client examples and some recent wins.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: And we'll take it and we'll take it from there. Start by sharing this. Should obviously recognize this. This first screen.  
Me: Handsome guy.  
Them: Obviously, you're in Prof. Good profile. And it's obviously I will find you in the first place. So it's good enough.  
Me: Oh, is it really? I didn't realize that.  
Them: Yes. Yeah. So obviously we use sales now. We look for people who've got X amount of experience in specific fields, they've run their own businesses, C suite, non exec roles. Prior as well. Obviously found yourself just from your own consultancy you've done here, so on and so forth. But sort you through the process. So when you come on board with ourselves, we get you to fill out what we call our preference form. It's how we take your criteria and build the campaign for yourself. So you select the businesses in terms of size, headcount, which you want us to target. We can obviously choose multiple or singular. We then get you to choose your industries. So there's over 300 different ones to choose from. You simply just go through, select what it is that you are interested in working in. Within this, there's over 300 different drop downs to choose from. So you can be flexible, you can be focused. It's completely up to yourself in terms of what it is you want to target. At the very bottom of the form there's a comment section. So if you want to be more specific. For example, Rob, I only want to work with construction businesses in Germany with 50 million turnover who have taken funding in the last two years. Put that in there. And obviously we can be more specific with who we target for yourself. Once you've made your selections. We'll build an audience for yourself. What this will be is it'll be a list of a thousand businesses that match up with your criteria, who are all going through a form of transition, along with, obviously, CEOs, founders, MDs that we're going to reach out to on your behalf. What we're going to do is we'll send it across to you until you're happy with what we're building for yourself. But we're not going to start anything. So you've got to sign this off, that you're happy with every business. If you're not happy for example, Acuity Solutions Mat and Red will just remove it and we'll replace it with a different business that does match multi criteria. So let me show you an example on a back client. So Courtney Home, she joined us in April. She wrote me saying it, but she was one of our more junior clients. She's not done any non exec work. Before, she'd run her own consultancy business. So what we did is we did a bit of a revamp on the LinkedIn. So we updated a banner tagline about sections, keywords and services to make a more visible on the platform. Help us communicate who she was. Helped fit LinkedIn's algorithm, made a profile more visible, if anything. How does this communicate who she was? Once we'd refreshed her LinkedIn and once she was happy with the audience that we built for herself. She started with some messaging. So these messages are going to go directly out from your LinkedIn profile to the individuals of the audience that we built for yourself. This message in itself is focused on herself, but it's flexible across different industries, gives an insight into her background. You know, what she's good at, where her experience lies and where she could add value to these businesses. In Courtney's case, campaign culture, action in the first two, three weeks. And Brian and Barry both responded to her interviews with herself. As soon as she got these responses back, what we did is we just paused all the outreach. We started focusing on preparation. So we brought in the founder for the business. So my boss to coach her through the process over the last 18 months is help to 600 people get their first non exec paid role. So we sort of know the process, what questions, what's gonna be relevant to them. So we coached through the process. We looked at market insights, we ran due diligence on the business check for CCJs, PEP sanctions, all of that stuff. In the end, she ended up going through this opportunity, Brian. She had a couple interviews with himself. So what we did then is we helped with the proposal. So we help write and we help present the proposal. Couple days later, the contract was signed. Obviously, she took the opportunity with Brian. So Courtney, as I say, she joined us in April, just as it is April. She's been placed twice into two other roles. She's currently working on a third opportunity with ourselves. She's a more senior example. So this is megan. Again if you haven't done any non exec work before. But however, she's obviously, she's been managing director, one of the managing directors, sorry, HSBC, for the last 12 years. So in terms of Megan's messaging, slightly different, focused on our experience. More focused on the industries as well. So again, we refreshed a LinkedIn. Started sending out the messaging. Then the first month she had 10 confirmed interviews across tech consulting data. We then provided, obviously, all the preparation documents prior to this, spotted it with understanding the interviews process and obviously what the opportunities actually were. So she joined us in August. Since August, she had 25 interviews with herself. Last Thursday, she took her first opportunity with a company called 2Tech. So the goal for us is not to just get you in front of a business and you take the first one that comes about. When you have a selection, five, 10 different businesses that you're talking with, then you can obviously cherry pick through and make sure you're picking the right company for yourself. Again. I'll just show you another most senior example. So this gent is called Andy Callum. He used to be head of finance over at McLaren. Literally last month, just placed it onto the board of advisors over at Win Races. He had obviously done some non exec work prior as well, so it was an easier place. One for us. But in terms of the process, as you say, Similar to what you're doing. Clearly, we're not reinventing the wheel. Process is not rocket science. The reason it works, it's organic, it's authentic. The CEOs that we reach out to technically don't know. We, as a business exist similar to yourself, because every message is coming from your own profile. What's like you're reaching out to them, understanding about how their business is, you know, currently looking what obviously your experience can do in order to take them through that transitional phase. Again, we're not applying to any job adverts, therefore, obviously there's no competition opportunities themselves. The creator on your skills, your LinkedIn, your experience and what it is you actually want to do. As opposed to you being approached for opportunities. It really came down to it. Same line of work as yourself. If I reach out to 1000 carefully selected CEOs, if nothing else. But the law of averages, obviously, doors are going to open up. Main thing for us is take away the time, take away the grunt work, frustration. You stay focused on your current clients. That was build your portfolio of opportunities up for yourself. And getting the opportunities that way. Final point, if you need it can support you throughout the whole process. Interview coaching, commercial preparation and full preparation briefs before every single interview as well. Does that make sense? Similar to what? Obviously you do in a sense already.  
Me: It is. I'm not a professor on Emerging director of hsbc, though, so I think that's why I've dipped into this in the past and looked at it. And it's not necessarily imposter syndrome, but you just think, well, where do I fit into that at the end of the day? I'm a consultant on paid search and ecommerce. I'm not aware of these non executive roles. As to what people actually want, do they? Need. Are they looking for someone that has more of a corporate background, or are they looking for someone who's like myself, is more hands on?  
Them: The latter, to be completely honest. Obviously, they're just some more senior examples. I've shown you. I'll show you, Lady Pod. Melanie. So, Melanie, she joined us in November last year. It took us seven weeks. One of our quickest placements. Melanie, she'd just been a consultant before she'd been a CEO. This was her own business. She helped with independent living schemes and so on and so forth. She hadn't really had much known exercise revamped her LinkedIn. Obviously pushed out the narrative, generated opportunities for herself. She got placed January this year since her first placement. She just paused the campaign. She didn't have capacity take on in the role. But, you know, we've got so many different sort of sorts of backgrounds that we work with. What I'll do after this call is I'll send you a list of case studies and testimonials for you to have a look through. For you to obviously make your own decision up. I would encourage you go to my boss's LinkedIn profile, obviously some recommendations there and how our process actually works and what we've done for people, obviously written by themselves as well. Let's have a look through that. But in terms of us, obviously, if you've got that experience across, Sector or an industry. For a long period of time. You've got more experience than a business starting up and a business scaling up. You know that you're experiencing in terms of what you can bring to them and with their challenges, because obviously invaluable to them. You know, full transparency. I place people into six month tenders, but the smallest remuneration I've seen was 16 and a half thousand pounds for a six month.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: To be fair, it was more a consultancy role. They'd gone as a non exec, but it was more of a consultancy. So obviously we can, we can work it either way. Just be fully transparent. We've got around 1500 clients, let's say 300 of our clients within that are actually consultants, us. In their own consultancy brands. So we could even take a motor consultancy approach for yourself if you wanted to just solely dip your toe in and then obviously we could push out non exec and board. It's completely up to yourself, you know, giving your experience. You wouldn't have reached out to you if we didn't. Think you'd be a good fit within it. But, I mean, it's down to yourself and obviously where you're wanting to. Where you're wanting to go. But in terms of the process, I'm guessing that all made sense in terms of what we do, how it works.  
Me: Yes, you did.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Again, obviously aligns pretty much with what you're doing. Do you take the. Do you do the email version of this technically, or how does your process work?  
Me: In what respect? Sorry, I didn't get.  
Them: So obviously with your paid searches that all. Is it SEO or what is it?  
Me: No space search. It's Google Ads.  
Them: With. Okay, okay. No, that's fine. But obviously, this is, you know, technically a marketing campaign, a personalized marketing campaign. But we're gonna act as a silent partner, obviously between yourself and the business that we're putting you in front of, so they technically don't know we exist.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: From a commercial point of view, our packages, we charge up front, but it's tailored around what you actually need from us to have an effective campaign. So our top package is 2750 pounds. To be fully transparent, not all of our clients pay that because they don't need all of our services. With ourselves, I will share the pricing with yourself so you can understand how that works. It's pretty much like a shopping list. You can pick and choose what elements you want, so everything is individually priced. There we go. Everything is individually priced for £4,000. But if you were to take it all together, 2750. However, obviously, if you wanted to take certain elements out and it's gonna be, you know, more than 2,750 pound, would put a package together for yourself, which obviously would be beneficial to. Yourself in terms of commercially. Point of view. But in terms of the pricing, obviously, I can go through that all in more detail if it's something that you wish to look at more in more detail yourself. In terms of next steps, typically I get my analysts who prepare value add report for yourself. This could possibly be really good for yourself. What we need is a CV from yourself. If you don't have an up to date CV you can send us over a PDF of your LinkedIn profile just with your experience on so we can see that. What we'll do is I will get our analysts to review it. They'll highlight where we think your biggest opportunities would be in terms of industries, in terms of key skills. And if you were to come on board, how would actually position yourself within our strategy itself? So what I'll do is I'll drop you an email after this call, if it's okay with yourself. Learn Information Path on it. So everything I've gone through is in black and white. There'll be some case studies on there, some testimonials on there for you to have a look through. Go away, drone. Due diligence and as Google reviews LinkedIn to do the report. As I say, just need a CV off yourself or a PDF of your LinkedIn profile. If you don't have that, upload that our analyst will get it back to you within 1224 hours. Suggestions from there I'll also put a diary link on the email. So obviously once you reviewed it all, it is something you wish to discuss further. We can go through the pricing in a lot more detail with you as well. Just feel free to put back in and we can take it from there. Sounds fair enough.  
Me: Cool. Yeah, it does. I think that's what's required, is the personal side of it. It's all well and good, looking at my LinkedIn profile, but actually applying that to the real world, that's what I would like to see. I don't want to be jumping into this. There's not going to be any kind of results from it.  
Them: Yeah, absolutely.  
Me: So. Yeah, that sounds perfect. Ok.  
Them: Yeah, absolutely. So what I will do. I will get this follow up information sent over to you. I'll put my diary link on there as well. So once you've had a review of it, obviously feel free to put back in if it is something you want to look at further. If not, worst case, you know where we are. You know, should you ever need us in the future, I want to look at it in more detail again. But as I say, I get it across here, have a good read through it. If anything, do the value add reports. So just either send me your CV or upload it to the link and we'll take it. From there, if that's okay.  
Me: Fantastic. Yeah, lovely. Thank you.  
Them: No, you're more than welcome. Great to meet you as well. Have a good read through it and hopefully we'll pick things back up once you've. Once you've reviewed it.  
Me: Thanks a lot, Rob. Cheers, mate.  
Them: But I'll take it easy. Peter speaks to him. Bye. Bye.
