## Transcript

Me: Yes, definitely. Apologies to you as well, Luiza.
Them: No worries. How are you? Doing?
Me: Say I've just implemented some AI stuff. I've been doing it the last two weeks and trying to juggle the customers and disasters. So I'm here.
Them: I can't imagine it's been quite busy on our side as well, because we work mostly with retail customers. So a lot of things going on.
Me: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely. Less so through no lights than for accessories to home accessories. The home has gone through the roof. But as to it's going to plan, which is nice. Uno likes is not going to be as busy this time of year anyway. But again, that's a growing account.
Them: I guess from this side, on the accessories, from the home side of things, one thing or two things I wanted to touch base with you on. Great to hear in general that things are picking up and that we're in a good position. I know we've spoken about this, kind of times, of the challenges, I guess. Within this account. So good to hear that we're starting to. We're in a good position at the time of year that we're in. One thing I wanted to ask and get a bit of an understanding on. I see we did increase the investment and kind of scale those budgets a little while back, but. One thing I wanted to show you is just really quickly here.
Me: Yep. Yep.
Them: In terms of overall account budget utilization. This just over the last seven days, we can see that Royston's kind of 5 November onwards, their campaigns have started to be in a position where they are overutilizing their budget. I was having a look at this breakdown here and this is just, I think this shows. Yeah, just yesterday. And we can see a couple of the campaigns, like one in particular, up 200% of its utilization. So want to get a bit of a feel and bit of a sense for what the next few weeks plan to look like in terms of that investment and in terms of that budget piece.
Me: The strategy for them for Christmas is round. I think it's around about the 15th. The expectation is that conversion rates are going to increase.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And at that time, then the budgets. I mean, it's the. The. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. That's. That's budget utilization. I. I'm seeing limited by budget on here. The accessories. The pmax accessories. Pretty much shopping accessories.
Them: So just look at this. And sidekicks and zombies. That's at that 200% as of yesterday. I don't know if this is just a snapshot in time and there's so many other variables.
Me: There's a. There's another. There's another £100 to go on the HS Zombies furniture. That top one that will be happening over the next few days. Don't want to do it yet. So it's like it's 10% under where it should be, really. So it's. Not. It's not a huge amount. The shopping accessories is small budget. It's 35 quid. That was another. Another Google rat ringing me.
Them: It's all go.
Me: So again, that's not too much of an issue. The villains, because of the segmentation. It's neither here nor there that it's. It's one I want to keep in check anyway, so. No, I get it. It's. It's doing what I expect it to do. And the client has been prepared, especially given the current performance, because I think overall, looking at company wide roas, it's about four. So that's that's where she wanted to be. So we're chucking. Right. I'm just being cautious at the moment that we're not necessarily seeing an increase in conversion rate commensurate with really go mad with the budgets yet. But we will be doing I decrease the target row asked by down from 200 to 190 the other day just to capture things. I think when we get into peak, that's going to go down to 150 and that really will up the budget. So, yeah.
Them: Nna. Make sense, I guess, by the signs of what you're saying, it's on the roadmap, on the horizons for the next couple days, obviously waiting on that significant kind of uplift in terms of that conversion rate, in terms of what we have been seeing and what we're forecasted to see. So. Tomorrow is Singles Day, which is more and more. Which is so funny that I read somewhere that it started off as like a complete, not a joke, but it started off as not this big thing at all. And now we're seeing interest grow significantly and definitely from a US book, particularly now from a UK point of view. It's now starting to mark the real kickoff of this kind of holiday piece.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's also more from a UK perspective, that interest in this time and on that day and sales in and around that time is increasing 33% year on year. So we are starting to see that growth of the importance of this day, which aligns with what you're saying in terms of over the next few days and week, we will hopefully start to see that increase in conversion rate with the budgets and the investment kind of trickling behind that, which makes sense and it's aligned.
Me: On that day. We. Also see that. Growth of. The reports of this. Day. And we. Know what you're saying. So people are going to buy themselves a snuggle chair for singles day.
Them: With us, isn't it? It's like people. I feel like the single stays low. Things are self gifting for themselves.
Me: Yeah.
Them: What do I want? But it's so funny. My mom does this every single year without fail. She buys herself a present, she wraps it for herself and puts it on straight. And she says to Lynn, from Lynn, you've been amazing this year. Happy Christmas. So it's the same narrative, I guess.
Me: Really? That's brilliant.
Them: Every year she does it. I wonder what she's gonna get this year.
Me: I think she probably knows that you don't see? Yes.
Them: But. We're just so funny. But, no, that all makes sense. And by the science of it, everything's kind of going in the right direction and where we want it to be, and I guess, more importantly, where we expect it to be.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, year on year, it's gone through the roof. Amazingly, I don't have the figures to hand at the moment, but it's. It's like about 200. It was about 150% up year on year. The other day, so. And we're tracking at the same ROAS as last year. So it's scale, it's properly scaled once. She's not very forthcoming with. Is telling me whether they are actually making a profit or not. You know, I'd hate to get to January and they go, well, yeah. We didn't make any money, though. Why did you sell me?
Them: And all is what you have and what you can get from her. I think that 150% growth, given the climate that we're in right now, is an amazing place to be in.
Me: On the aov. It's not cheap stuff that they're doing, so I think we're smashing it, really. But she's always doom and gloom. At least at the moment. She's not coming back to me. Oh, we didn't do very well yesterday.
Them: You can't look on a daily basis. I'm sure you're sick of having that conversation.
Me: It was funny because it was the end of October. You would expect like payday to be a good time, but for that particular one, seven days, nothing. Unfortunately, I don't really have year on year figures that are statistically significant. The spend was quite low, so last year, so you can't really compare it, so. You know, next year we'll be in a better position.
Them: Amazing, but by the science of it, from our conversations, like amazing work has been done and to be in that position, I think, as we said, given the climate, I think she should be very happy. But hopefully somewhere all of this revenue is profitable. But we shall see.
Me: Well, she's, she's given me confirmation that in January they're going to go into sale the same as they've done last year as well. And according to the analysis, they're going to be better in January than they did doing they're going to do in December. It's just it's controlling the midpoint between. Well, they might not be a midpoint. You know, we might go straight into it Boxing Day, if she's quick. But, you know, she gets the sale prices done quickly and gets the messaging out there. So fingers crossed you'll do that. But yeah, it should be better in January.
Them: Amazing. Remind me, when is there financial year again? I think I have tomorrow.
Me: I don't know what the financial year is.
Them: Morning.
Me: Don't know.
Them: Ok. No worries. I guess it could be nice if there are forecasts to do better in January, if that is the beginning of the new financial year, to have a really strong start. But yeah, don't worry about that one. The other thing that I want to do touch base with you on again update. I know we spoke. We're in the imac side of things and I know we kind of chatted through some potential different ways that we could maybe test.
Me: Yeah, sorry, yeah, I've just not had time to do this. Yes, you're quite correct. I need to do something with it. It is actually on my to do list.
Them: Perfect.
Me: It's on Claude's to do list clause written me one. So he will be done. It's just when I can fit it in or not. It would be a great time. You know, volumes are up potentials there, but whatever. I'll do what I can.
Them: Now I got it. Everyone is time poor at the moment. Completely. There isn't enough hours in the day to get what we need to do, Don. And the days are going by like that, which is.
Me: They certainly are. Yeah, yeah.
Them: Just to kind of go over that one brief time and just to show you this piece, which was kind of the key driver as to why now is such a good time. It was around these longer to help questions really starting to ramp up as we do go into November and December. The questions, comparisons, inspiration, type queries that we need to be leveraging max in order to get in front of. So, yeah, I guess I completely appreciate the time that we're in and that you are stressed for time, but we just want to be able to capitalize on it in November and into December when we do see these longer tail queries and search terms being on the higher side.
Me: What an interesting graph. That is.
Them: It's so hard to read. I feel like this one. But, yeah, essentially the cover is a number of different types of queries that we see. And we looking at the kind of the darker tiles here, when we go into November and December, those questions comparison, we've got obviously some price ones and then obviously in December, that's when the delivery, the pickle like those kind of ones start to increase.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But November is a key comparison question, inspiration type queries that we're just never going to be able to get in front of with traditional search terms and keywords. I know we chatted through this, but just to kind of go over it again, the different options that we could look into from a testing point of view, I think we came to the conclusion for Accessories for the Home. Given the campaign types that were leveraging at the moment, the best option would be because we don't really leverage generic search that much to launch a new one and exclude our top performing keywords across our other campaigns and really let it focus on incrementality and let it kind of serve its purpose aside from our existing campaigns and let it do its own thing separately and not impact and interfere with existing campaign performance. Because I think based on the campaigns that we have, it makes the most sense to do that.
Me: That's interesting. So the action really is to create that campaign with luxury furniture, artisan furniture, and then, as you say, exclude the top performing keywords. The keywords that have the conversions recently. Okay, so it's not going to impact the PMAX campaign.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Exactly. That's what I would say would be the best. I guess there's different ways and I would maybe offer different strategy for accounts that have a lot of generic search going on already. With the fact we're very invested in tmax and shopping, it makes the most sense to just launch something new and give it those guardrails from an exclusion and a negative point of view and just let it do its own thing and see what else are we leaving on the table from a keyword and search term point of view when considering those longer tail side of things. Yeah, I don't know even if there is an existing or an old generic search that you could just get live again and do some tweaking too, which I know it still takes time, but it's.
Me: No, I just don't trust the ad tech, to be honest.
Them: Ok?
Me: So I could try and construct something from the existing asset group and pull it over. I'll ask Claude, see what he can do.
Them: Yeah. See if you can get him to help out in any way. They were the main things from the accessories, from the home side of things. Was there any sort for that account in particular?
Me: Okay? Yep. No, that's fine. That's fine. It's going well. I'm really pleased with it. I'm still waiting for Ms. Stools from her, though. That's the bit that's not working.
Them: Amaz. Ing.
Me: I am. And I've emailed her a few times. I know you're busy. Finally. I just did a brand new email. Is there any chance of having these bar stools? And that's all I put.
Them: Paus. E. Nothing around the bush here. I need the.
Me: I'm sitting on the floor.
Them: Best coming over for Christmas. But no, we will keep in touch on that one. Let's keep an eye on the conversion rate and the budgets over the next few weeks as we go into November and December. Position to be in.
Me: Okay? Definitely. Yeah, definitely.
Them: Amazing.
Me: Thank you. Next. I should do this. I should set aside an hour and get all of you lined up, and I can go through them one by one. That'll be fantastic. It really would.
Them: My turn. Now. Yes. Me and Lizzie close by. And then I saw that she was talking to you in another video, like Peter exhausted.
Me: Great idea. Great idea. Thank you. No, I appreciate that. I'm not avoiding people. It's just, you know, when it's like this time of year, I need something really laser guiding. I can just chuck on with things. So I appreciate it. Thank you.
Them: Noise. It works for us as well, so everyone is happy.
Me: Good.
Them: But on my side for Luna Lights.
Me: Yep.
Them: And I can see that the performance over the last few weeks has been quite good. And did you lunch on your vlans campaign?
Me: Not a new one, though.
Them: It's been there. Ok. Because one thing I notice is. So first of all, the brand campaign is the one that we enable the Amex for search.
Me: Yep.
Them: Almost three times the rows performance that we have as a target. So I say pretty well. What we did is also, it's.
Me: Wow.
Them: Like something that you can try maybe for the other account is. I think we added the exclusions. So something similar to what you suggested, Luksy. So it's like to back up here. That it's been working well for. Actually, let me share here. For Luna Lights. And then we added the brand list.
Me: It's funny that it's. It's funny how it's actually worked. Because when I look at the match types, I'm not seeing any AI max match types in the, in the, the search query report. Because it is. Has got Brown exclusion on it. And it's. I have no idea why that is. Why would that make such a difference?
Them: I believe it's because whenever there is exact match the system is gonna prioritize it that but the IMX would give you more visibility.
Me: Okay?
Them: Search queries.
Me: That is amazing. I've. I've not looked at this, Luiza. Oh, go on. I'll be honest. I really didn't think you make any difference. I really did not think it'd make any difference. That is quite extraordinary. So it's more likely to be shown in the AIO stuff now than if it's. If it's on AI Max. Is that. Is that what it is?
Them: Yeah. What it does is depending on what people are searching. We're gonna bring them all relevant. Added.
Me: Ron.
Them: So it's not gonna be as generic as it was before, especially if the search type, search query are very specific.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Example. I'm looking for the best lights to put in my kitchen. Scene.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's very hard to predict the keyword and make a list for those long queries that people are searching nowadays. So the IMAX takes that into consideration. And it's more visibility over those different search queries. And bring the more relevant ATT to the user. So in terms of user experience as well. It is much better for the client on the client side.
Me: Sorry. Now I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm just wondering whether to use AI Max on accessories to the home, then. On the brand campaign.
Them: I think with the brand for accessories for the home. The fact it's quite generic as well. It's obviously a generic brand name which also gives its channels. Luisa, did you put brand inclusions on when you did it for Uno Lights?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, we did. Yeah. So I recommend doing the same. So we wanna just give it some kind of guardrails.
Me: Okay? Yeah. It's not work before brand exclusion on accessories, though. And because it is so generic, I know lighting is but accessories down. Was proper generic, and it just didn't like it at all. It throttled it, so. Okay, well, a case for AI Max on the. On the generic. I think I do like AI Max. I switch it on pretty much everywhere now.
Them: Anyway. Just one of the accessories. If we are turning it on on the Bronco and we don't have brand inclusions, I would recommend a more regular review of the search toolboarded and just keeping on top of those negatives just because we're continuing to steer it in the right direction.
Me: Yeah. Cool. Okay. Back to inner light. Ing.
Them: In terms of the budget, Peter, we've been limited by, which is quite a lot recently. I know that seasonality, it doesn't play a big part for them. But demand is there. Are they happy to keep investing on the ads?
Me: Yeah, it's just a. It's just an uncomfortable conversation that I have with them, you know, when the numbers that we're talking about are quite enormous. You know, it's this. This probably is that. This right now is probably their busiest time of year. People getting stuff done before Christmas. But it's making that recommendation. I don't know how much this would scale, because if you look at. I've just increased them slightly, then. Well, slightly by about 300 quid. But if you think like the main campaign, 730 against 1, 200. The shopping one was 250 and it's. 670. It's. It's enormous, the differences. So I'm. I'm more inclined just to gradually creep them along rather than just go absolutely nuts with it, which is what I could do. I think it's. It might be a good idea for me just to draw a line in the sun here. I've increased them. Let's look at them again in three or four days time and see whether it's utilizing all that budget, is actually bringing in the roas that we want. Then that might. Might be the good case for them. If I speak to them and say I need to increase it, and this is what happened last time, then that would be the argument for continuing with it.
Them: I think that sounds like a plan, starting with the ones that we know that results are better.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Especially this one here. Another thing I wanted to touch on this campaign. I noticed we're not optimizing towards new clients. Where the other ones are.
Me: It's a villains campaign. It's, it's products that don't actually work. So it's, it doesn't, it doesn't do a huge amount. It's never going to bring in a huge amount of revenue. But, yes, I understand what you. I've now just twigged. What you mean. Yes, I will put that penny on there, yes.
Them: I think. It helps in the case because.
Me: It's more analysis, isn't it? You know?
Them: We can and push the products for people that haven't bought before.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Could help in the villains case.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I wanted to show you the latest snapshot in terms of missed opportunity for the account. And it's mostly.
Me: Budget.
Them: With and budgets. So this is for the last month. And from what I can see, it started November. The demand really increased for them. So we can see things are big enough. And they're missing out on conversions, mostly because of BITS constraints. So this goes into target robots.
Me: Yeah.
Them: If there's a flexibility on the target rows, it might be the case that they could be selling a bit more and scaling. And this combined with the constraint by budget also helps. So it's a combination of both, and it's what most advertisers are doing in the month of November is being a little bit more aggressive with those targets.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And the budget because the ad space, it's been quite competitive. But demand is also growing as like singles day, Black Friday, Christmas. So the demand is there. It's very compact overall in the market.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, agreed. Yeah, it's lovely that there's potential there. It's lovely. It's not the other way around, you know, that. I think the last two years with. With a lot of clients, it's been just trying to get something going this year. This year has been a crappy old year. For recon for my clients. Anyway, I don't know. You've seen it elsewhere. It's been really poor, and it's just funny how. I don't know. It's just because I'm doing something right now, or whether it's the general landscape that despite all that, people are starting to spend money again. I was expecting a really poor Christmas and it doesn't appear general feel. I can't put numbers on this, but the general feel is I don't think it is going to be. I do see that there is been a nice early start to all this. Rather than in years gone by we all wait till Black Friday and then just go nuts. The last three or four weeks. This year it does seem to be a bit more spread out.
Them: Yeah, no, definitely. And it's starting earlier. I don't know if we. Maybe I showed you last time.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's in regards to the demand that we expect during peak season. Give me just one second here. So every year we start to see it starts earlier. So this is the month of November. And this is the demand that we expect. Overall. We are here. Single thing.
Me: Sorry. Where are you? Luiz.
Them: Sorry. Can you see this after Black Friday tree? Maybe it's not because it's not showing here. We are here. On the single day.
Me: Okay?
Them: And day onwards, it's only creating.
Me: That spike on BF minus 2. That's a week between. That's next week, basically. Is it?
Them: Yes.
Me: Right.
Them: This is next week.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And the week after. So the week before Black Friday. The Friday is called Fake Friday. And then many people get confused. Which day is it? And the promotions are already out. So it's the second highest peak. And then black Friday.
Me: We need another one now. Fake. Fake Friday. Don't we just keep moving it back?
Them: As usual.
Me: To beginning of November.
Them: It should be spend your money November.
Me: Yes, that's right. Yeah. Well, I was tried. Wasn't it where it was Black November that people went for just to try and do it and it's too obvious. That needs to be a bit more subtle, pushing people back to beginning of the month. That's good. That's good news. Well, that ties up, really, with everything that I've seen on the strategy building for Q4. For pretty much all the clients is that it's round about the 15th last year when everything picks up, I might even move things back a few days. And start to look at this Friday to start to ramp things up rather than waiting. I suppose that is pretty much the 15th anyway, isn't it?
Them: It makes sense to start today, even, because how things go up.
Me: Yeah.
Them: From onwards.
Me: I just don't know about Uno because it's pretty much a B to B and there will be consumers in there, but it is B to B and whether it's going to describe the same thing for them as it would do for B2C clients.
Them: I would take, the demand for DTC would be a little bit higher. But because of the marketness of the market, they also need to stand out in a way. So if we continue with the same level of spend we have at the minute, We might see performance not being as good as we want because of the market increases. And the competition.
Me: Yeah, okay. Cool. That's good news as well, then. Right. I'll have a discussion for the client today and just put it to them. I'll just get a story together for them about it and see whether they want to just go for the jugular, really. Because that's what it is, isn't it? If we're constrained by budget on here. We're hitting the targets. I mean it's 205 and if I look at last 30 days rose by conversion, Simon's 205. That's bobble. So no reason why we can't just. Usually it's dropping the ROAS targets. In this case, it might just be a. Case of Leave the rose targets as they are, just increase the budget. Okay?
Them: We can do a bit of both as well. If there is the flexibility.
Me: Yeah, but one step at a time. Let's see how we get on. Because if the Rails target isn't right, it's not going to be able to spend that budget, is it?
Them: Yeah.
Me: So we probably got another 500 pound a day to spend. There. I'll need to sit them down with that one. Glass of whiskey or something. I need another three and a half grand a week. Is that all right? We've even shown them revenue, then they're going to go for it. They're very forward thinking people.
Them: That sounds like a plan.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So just to recap. On my side. Speaking. Budget talks with the client. The new customer acquisition on the Villains campaign. To push a little bit further and get more information. Am I forgetting anything? I think that's all. And on this side is AMX testing.
Me: Yeah. The what? Testing. Sorry.
Them: The AI max.
Me: Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Be nice to do it on both of them, wouldn't it? Both generic campaigns on both the accounts. But let's see what. See what time we've got.
Them: Peter, one last thing to show you, and just because it sparked my mind when you mentioned about if we can do something maybe starting earlier and ahead of the weekend. Just one last thing. And this is from an EMEA point of view, but we can see the UK is the biggest driver here, but what we see in November is clear patterns and spikes in demand on weekends. So if we were looking to, say, maybe go live or push things slightly more aggressively on Monday, we could potentially be missing on a lot more opportunity on the weekend. And I would just kind of weave this into planning and timelines that we do tend to see this the other point was just on the Fake Friday piece at Luiza mentioned, obviously, the demand, I think, was 80% of what we saw on Black Friday last year. But the key part of it is obviously competition being a lot lower. And CPC has actually been 27% cheaper across categories and across EMEA. So in general, auctions are less competitive than CPCs are cheaper. Well, that demand was still there, so, yeah, I guess just good pieces to kind of bear in mind, especially that where we do see these spikes in demand,
Me: Cool. Okay? Lovely.
Them: Look, thank you so much for your time. It was great to touch base.
Me: I'd lost.
Them: We popped some time in for a couple weeks and even just a brief check and with myself and Luiza, so we can just make sure all is good and that we have everything we need.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm quite happy doing this as a joint meeting. If we just keep it to 15 minutes, that'd be fantastic. Really?
Them: Snappy. Thank you so much. Luiza and I will touch base and we'll get something locked in then from there.
Me: Brilliant. Thank you very much indeed.
Them: Bye. Bye. You're doing bye.
Me: Bye. Bye, ladies.
