## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Potential Data Reporting Delay

**Observation**: Impression share shows Friday dips across multiple client accounts, suggesting a data reporting delay rather than actual performance issues.

**Cross-Account Analysis Results** (Nov 9, 2025):
- **Accessories for the Home**: Friday avg IS 45.5% vs other days avg 57.3% (**-11.8pp Friday dip**)
- **Tree2Mydoor**: Friday avg IS 30.6% vs other days avg 37.1% (-6.5pp)
- **Uno Lighting**: Friday avg IS 58.6% vs other days avg 65.9% (-7.3pp)
- **Just Bin Bags**: Friday avg IS 50.3% vs other days avg 58.0% (-7.7pp)

**Google Ads Impression Share Reporting**:
- Impression share updates less frequently than other metrics (clicks, impressions)
- Can take up to 48 hours to fully populate
- Some reports calculate once daily
- Known delays have occurred historically (e.g., August 2022)

**Impact on This Analysis**:
- **Nov 7 (Friday) drop may be due to incomplete data**, not actual performance
- Nov 8-9 data may also be incomplete
- Need to wait 48-72 hours for full data population

**Action**: Re-check impression share data on Nov 12 (1 week post-change) when data should be fully populated.

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING: Drop Occurred on November 7

The Search impression share drop happened **2 days after** the ROAS target change, not immediately. This suggests the algorithm had time to adjust, but then hit a quality/competitive wall.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Deficiency: **Rank-Lost Impression Share Explosion**

**The Problem**: Rank-lost IS increased from 45.4% (Nov 5) to **90.0%** (Nov 8), meaning:
- **Before**: Losing 45% of auctions to competitors
- **After**: Losing **90%** of auctions to competitors
- **Impact**: Campaign can't compete effectively in Search auctions

### Why This Happened:

#### 1. **Data Reporting Delay** (Most Likely - Primary Factor)
- **Nov 7 (Friday) drop likely due to incomplete impression share data**
- Cross-account analysis shows consistent Friday dips (11.8pp lower for AFH)
- Impression share can take 48-72 hours to fully populate
- **This is likely a data delay issue, not actual performance problem**

#### 2. **ROAS Target Change Impact** (Secondary Factor - If Data Confirms)
- **190% ROAS target** is MORE aggressive than 200% (allows lower ROAS)
- Google IS bidding more aggressively, but still losing auctions
- This suggests the problem is NOT bid strategy, but quality score/competitive pressure
- Even with more aggressive bidding (190%), campaign can't compete effectively

#### 3. **Competitive Pressure Intensified** (If Data Confirms)
- **Nov 7** coincides with increased competitive activity
- Holiday shopping season = more competitors bidding higher
- Auction Insights shows 22+ active competitors
- Competitors (Dunelm 59%, daals 40%, etc.) likely increased bids

#### 4. **Quality Score Issues** (If Data Confirms)
- Rank-lost IS at 90% suggests quality score problems
- Lower CVR (0.40% → 0.31%) despite higher CTR indicates:
  - Ad relevance issues
  - Landing page experience problems
  - Product feed quality issues

#### 5. **Budget Constraints** (Secondary - If Data Confirms)
- Budget-lost IS increased from 0.6% to 20.3% (Nov 9)
- Campaign spending budget too quickly
- Can't participate in full day's auctions

## 🎯 Specific Deficiencies Identified

### 1. **Data Reporting Delay** 🔴 CRITICAL (Most Likely - Primary Issue)
- **Issue**: Impression share data not fully populated on Friday (Nov 7)
- **Evidence**: 
  - Cross-account analysis shows consistent Friday dips (11.8pp lower for AFH)
  - Nov 7 drop coincides with Friday (known reporting delay day)
  - Multiple clients show Friday impression share dips
  - Google Ads impression share can take 48-72 hours to fully populate
- **Impact**: Analysis based on incomplete data - conclusions may be premature
- **Fix**: Wait 48-72 hours and re-check impression share data on Nov 12

### 2. **Quality Score Deficiency** 🟡 SECONDARY (If Data Confirms Drop)
- **Issue**: Rank-lost IS at 90% indicates quality score problems preventing auction wins
- **Evidence**: 
  - Rank-lost IS jumped from 45% to 90% despite MORE aggressive bidding (190% vs 200%)
  - CVR declined (0.40% → 0.31%) despite higher CTR
  - Even with aggressive bidding, campaign losing 90% of auctions to rank
- **Impact**: Quality score issues preventing campaign from competing, regardless of bid strategy
- **Fix**: Review ad relevance, landing page experience, product feed quality

### 3. **Bid Strategy Consideration** 🟡 TERTIARY (If Data Confirms Drop)
- **Issue**: 190% ROAS target is MORE aggressive than 200%, but may need to be even more aggressive
- **Evidence**: Rank-lost IS still at 90% even with more aggressive bidding
- **Impact**: May need to test 185% ROAS target to compete with aggressive competitors
- **Fix**: Consider testing 185% ROAS target AFTER confirming data is complete and fixing quality score issues

### 4. **Competitive Response Deficiency** 🟡 TERTIARY (If Data Confirms)
- **Issue**: Campaign not responding to increased competitor activity
- **Evidence**: Drop coincided with holiday shopping season
- **Impact**: Competitors outbidding in 90% of auctions
- **Fix**: Monitor Auction Insights, consider more aggressive bidding

### 5. **Budget Pacing Deficiency** 🟡 TERTIARY (If Data Confirms)
- **Issue**: Budget-lost IS increased to 20.3% (Nov 9)
- **Evidence**: Campaign spending budget too quickly
- **Impact**: Can't participate in full day's auctions
- **Fix**: Review daily budget allocation, consider budget increase

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours):

1. **WAIT FOR DATA TO FULLY POPULATE** (Priority - Do This First):
   - [ ] Wait 48-72 hours for impression share data to fully populate
   - [ ] Re-check impression share data on Nov 12 (1 week post-change)
   - [ ] Compare Nov 12 data with Nov 7-9 data to confirm if drop was real or reporting delay
   - [ ] Do NOT make decisions based on incomplete Friday data

2. **If Data Confirms Drop - Fix Quality Score Issues** (Secondary):
   - [ ] Review ad relevance scores in Google Ads UI
   - [ ] Check landing page experience scores
   - [ ] Review product feed quality in Merchant Center
   - [ ] Check for feed errors or data quality issues
   - [ ] Review asset performance in Performance Max

3. **If Data Confirms Drop - Then Consider Bid Strategy** (Tertiary):
   - [ ] If quality score improves, 190% target may work
   - [ ] If still struggling, test 185% ROAS target (even more aggressive)
   - [ ] Monitor impression share recovery (target: >30%)

### Decision Point (November 12):

**After data fully populates, re-analyze**:
- If IS recovers above 30%: Likely was data delay, continue monitoring
- If IS still below 30%: Then investigate quality score and bid strategy issues
- Compare Nov 12 data with Nov 7-9 to confirm if drop was real

## 📊 Key Insights

### What the Data Tells Us:

1. **Friday impression share dips are systematic**:
   - Cross-account analysis shows consistent Friday dips (11.8pp for AFH)
   - This suggests data reporting delay, not actual performance issues
   - Wait 48-72 hours before analyzing Friday impression share data
   - Nov 7 drop may be incomplete data, not real performance problem

2. **The drop was delayed**: IS maintained at 54% on Nov 5, dropped on Nov 7 (Friday)
   - Coincides with known impression share reporting delay day
   - May be data delay rather than algorithm/performance issue

3. **ROAS target change was MORE aggressive, not less**:
   - 200% → 190% = MORE aggressive bidding (allows lower ROAS)
   - Google IS bidding more aggressively, but still losing auctions
   - This confirms the problem is quality score, not bid strategy
   - Even aggressive bidding can't overcome quality score deficiencies

4. **If data confirms drop - rank-lost IS is the primary issue**: 90% rank loss means quality/bid problems
   - Not just budget constraints
   - Quality score or bid strategy preventing competition

### Why This Matters:

- **90% rank-lost IS** means losing 9 out of 10 auctions to competitors
- This is not sustainable - campaign can't generate volume
- Quality score improvements needed regardless of bid strategy
- May need to accept lower ROAS to compete effectively
