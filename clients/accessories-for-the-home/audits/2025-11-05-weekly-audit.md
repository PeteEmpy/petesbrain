## 🧪 Experiment Implemented: ROAS Target Reduction to 190%

**Date**: November 5, 2025  
**Hypothesis**: Reducing ROAS target from 200% to 190% will increase impression share and overall revenue by bidding more aggressively in competitive auctions.

### Campaigns Modified:

1. **Main P Max (Furniture H&S/Zombies)**
   - Previous: 200% (set Oct 20)
   - New: **190%** (Nov 5)
   - Campaign ID: 20276730131
   - Name now shows: "...200 20/10 **190 5/11**"

2. **Shopping Furniture (Villains)**
   - Previous: 200% (set Oct 20)
   - New: **190%** (Nov 5)  
   - Campaign ID: 21527979308
   - Name now shows: "...200 20/10 **190 5/11**"

### Rationale:

**Problem**: 51.3% rank-lost impression share on main campaign (losing half of potential impressions to competitors)

**Context**:
- Cox & Cox competitor surge mid-October
- Oct 20 ROAS reduction (210% → 200%) didn't fully resolve impression share loss
- Seasonal browsing pattern (CVR at 0.42%)
- Need more aggressive bidding to compete

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Impression share increase from 45% to 55-60%
- ROAS may drop to 1.85-1.90 temporarily
- Overall revenue increase of 15-20%

**Success Criteria**:
- ROAS stays above 1.80
- Impression share increases by 10+ percentage points
- Revenue increase justifies ROAS drop

**Monitoring**:
- Daily checks for first 7 days
- Revert if ROAS drops below 1.80
- Full assessment after 1 week (Nov 12)

## 📊 First Day Results (Nov 5 only)

**Note**: Early data from Nov 5 (single day):

### Main P Max (H&S/Zombies)
- ROAS: **1.01** (very low, but day 1 of test)
- Impression Share: 10.0% (concerning drop)
- Rank Lost IS: **90.0%** (CRITICAL - worse than before!)
- Spend: £1,271

**⚠️ Early Warning**: First day shows dramatic impression share drop. This is unusual - ROAS reduction should improve auction participation, not worsen it. Likely factors:
- Day 1 algorithm adjustment period
- Need 3-5 days for Google to optimize
- Possible feed/quality score issue concurrent with change

**Monitor Closely**: If impression share doesn't recover by Nov 7-8, may indicate deeper quality score problem.

### Shopping Furniture (Villains)
- ROAS: **4.82** (excellent!)
- Spend: £73
- Revenue: £353

**✅ Strong first day**: ROAS much improved, suggesting 190% target is working well here.

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Rank-Lost Impression Share (Primary Issue)

**Why This Matters**: Losing 51-90% of impressions means competitors are outbidding us in auctions.

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Competitive Pressure** (confirmed from CONTEXT):
   - Cox & Cox advertising surge mid-October
   - Other competitors may have increased budgets for Christmas season
   
2. **Quality Score Issues**:
   - CTR at 0.91% relatively low for P Max
   - May indicate ad relevance or creative fatigue
   - Feed quality could be factor

3. **ROAS Target Too Restrictive** (testing now):
   - 200% may be too high given competition
   - 190% test should show if this is the cause

4. **Seasonal Auction Competition**:
   - Pre-Christmas period = higher CPCs
   - More advertisers competing for same searches

### Seasonal Browsing Pattern (Secondary Factor)

**Evidence**:
- CVR at 0.42% (low)
- High click volume (11,592 in 7 days)
- Lower conversion rate

**Interpretation**: Users browsing/researching before Christmas purchases, not ready to buy yet.

**Expected Resolution**: Mid-November upturn as buying intent increases (per your historical pattern analysis).

## 📝 Recommendations Going Forward

### Immediate (This Week):

1. **Monitor 190% Test Closely**
   - Give it 5-7 days before making judgments
   - If impression share doesn't recover by Nov 8, may indicate quality score issue not bid issue

2. **If Impression Share Doesn't Improve by Nov 8**:
   - Review asset performance in P Max
   - Check product feed quality
   - Consider if creative refresh needed

3. **Shopping Accessories Budget**:
   - Performing at 3.12 ROAS with good control
   - Could increase budget if 190% test successful elsewhere

### Week 2 (Nov 12+):

1. **Assess Experiment Results**:
   - If successful (ROAS >1.85, IS up 10%+): Consider 185% for further test
   - If marginal (ROAS 1.80-1.85, IS up 5%): Keep at 190%
   - If unsuccessful (ROAS <1.80): Revert to 200%, investigate quality scores

2. **Asset Refresh**:
   - Review top-performing products
   - Add new images/videos if CTR remains low
   - Focus on hero products from Product Performance Spreadsheet

3. **Feed Quality Audit**:
   - Check competitive pricing
   - Review image quality
   - Ensure all attributes populated
