## Strategic Context

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Focus**: Google Ads with Performance Max
- **Bidding Strategy**: 
  - ROAS target reduced from 210% to 200% (Oct 20, 2025) to counteract seasonal impression drop
  - ROAS target further reduced from 200% to 190% (Nov 5, 2025) on Main P Max and Shopping Furniture campaigns
  - **Status**: Testing - Full week analysis scheduled Nov 12, 2025
- **Recent Adjustment**: Base ROAS reduction made proactively before peak season to maintain visibility
- **Seasonality Awareness**: Monitoring early indicators of seasonal decline and adjusting targets ahead of trend

## Historical Performance Patterns

### Seasonality
[TBD - analyze historical data]

### Year-Over-Year Trends
[TBD]

### Known Anomalies
- **October 17, 2025 Revenue Drop**: Significant single-day revenue decline raised client concern
  - **Site traffic**: Down 30% vs previous week
  - **Orders**: 6 orders total (lower than normal)
  - **Problem**: All 6 orders were small-ticket items; no large purchases that typically boost daily revenue
  - **Technical assessment**: Nothing wrong with website (Andrew confirmed)
  - **Google Ads**: No visibility loss, spend and impressions normal
  - **External factor identified**: Cox and Cox (major competitor) increased advertising spend
  - **Resolution**: Monitoring over weekend; normalized after anomaly day

### What Doesn't Work
[TBD]

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| [TBD] | [From experiment log] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

### Recent Experiments (from log):
- **20/10/2025 15:31**: Base ROAS dropped from 210% to 200% to try and counteract a drop in impressions. This drop in impressions may well be seasonal but as there is a strong ROAS being achieved at the moment, it's worth doing prior to the season starting proper.

- **05/11/2025**: ROAS target reduced from 200% to 190% on Main P Max (Furniture H&S/Zombies) and Shopping Furniture (Villains) campaigns
  - **Note**: "H&S/Zombies" and "Villains" refer to Product Hero performance labels, not product categories
  - **Hypothesis**: Reducing ROAS target will increase impression share and overall revenue by bidding more aggressively
  - **Status**: Testing - Preliminary analysis (4 days) completed Nov 9, 2025
  - **Full Analysis Scheduled**: November 12, 2025 (1 week post-change)

## Product Hero Settings

### Current Configuration (Last Updated: 2025-11-16)

**Campaign**: AFH | P Max | H&S Zombies Furniture
**Target ROAS**: 170%
**Previous**: 190% (changed 2025-11-16, originally 200% from 2025-11-05)
**Actual ROAS Achieved**: 4.0 (company-wide)
**Performance Impact**: Monitoring through Nov 18-21 for CR, spend, revenue stability

**Rationale**: Q4 Peak Season Phase 1 - Conversion rate trending up (0.43% → 0.52%, +21% WoW), budget utilization at 200%, reduced ROAS to capture peak season volume while maintaining profitability.

|------|---------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 2025-11-16 | Campaign ROAS | 190% | 170% | Q4 Phase 1: CR up +21%, budget at 200%, peak season scaling | [Monitoring Nov 18-21] Phase 2 to 150% planned |
| 2025-11-05 | Campaign ROAS | 200% | 190% | Counteract impression drop, test before peak season | Testing - full week analysis Nov 12 |
| 2025-10-20 | Campaign ROAS | 210% | 200% | Proactive seasonal adjustment to maintain visibility | [TBD] |

**Note**: Product Hero automatically classifies products daily as Heroes/Sidekicks/Villains/Zombies based on performance. These labels sync to Google Merchant Center and guide campaign structure. Target ROAS settings control the algorithm's bidding aggressiveness.

## Quick Reference

## Performance Tracking Spreadsheets

### Product Performance Spreadsheet
[View Daily Product Performance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V23MwIeSDTj5ECBJAOIukENzy3YMxUoOEMiSP2IZAWM/edit)

Tracks daily product-level performance metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, ROAS) with historical data dating back to October 2025.

### Revenue Tracking Spreadsheet
[View Daily Revenue Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ug4zELJMNB0fQegg1fK0N2Kbaj1A3TkLwYz6WzsJBiQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Tracks total daily site revenue (all sources).

**Important: Two Different ROAS Metrics**

1. **Google Ads ROAS (Target: 190%)**
   - Formula: Google Ads Conversion Value ÷ Google Ads Cost
   - This is the bidding target set in campaigns
   - Example (Nov 4-10, 2025): £17,394.57 ÷ £8,021.06 = 217%

2. **Overall Site ROAS**
   - Formula: Total Site Revenue ÷ Google Ads Cost
   - Shows total business impact of Google Ads spend
   - Includes non-attributed conversions and indirect traffic
   - Example (Nov 4-10, 2025): £29,989.08 ÷ £8,021.05 = 374%
   - Not compared to the 190% target - this is a separate metric

**Note:** Always clarify which ROAS metric is being discussed. The 190% target applies only to Google Ads attributed conversions, not total site revenue.
