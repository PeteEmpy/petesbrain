## Positive Bakes: Change PMAX Campaign to Target ROAS 120%
**Completed:** 2025-11-20
**Source:** Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**Campaign:** Positive Bakes Performance Max
**Change:** Bid strategy changed from Max Conversions to Target ROAS 120%

**Why:** Account is converting but very poorly. Trying to get more value/action by optimizing for higher-value orders rather than just conversions.

**Context:**
- Current performance: Converting but with poor order values
- Timing: Just before Black Friday (Nov 29) - uncertain impact from holiday shopping behavior
- Goal: Increase average order value while maintaining or improving conversion volume

**Expected Impact:**
- Hoping to see increase in order value
- May see Google Ads optimize towards higher-value customers
- Bid strategy learning period: ~2 weeks typical, but Black Friday will affect data

**Review Date:** Wednesday, Nov 27, 2025 (1 week check-in before full Black Friday impact)

**Success Criteria:**
- Average order value increases
- ROAS stabilizes at or above 120%
- Revenue maintains or improves despite potential conversion volume changes

**Note:** Black Friday timing means results may be mixed with holiday shopping patterns. Will need to separate baseline performance from seasonal effects.
