Hi Aatin,

Quick weekend update for Positive Bakes:

Overall the campaigns ran well - spent £150.75 over Fri-Sun with some solid activity:
• Friday was strongest - £323 in total conversions on £24 spend
• Saturday saw good engagement - £196 conversions on £88 spend
• Sunday a bit quieter - £18 conversions on £39 spend

The Shopping campaign targeting Free From products continues to perform well, and your Brand Search campaign picked up some nice conversions on Saturday.

Everything's running smoothly on the Google Ads side. I'm still working on investigating those Merchant Centre product availability issues we discussed - should have findings for you early this week.

How are things going on your end? Hope you had a good weekend!

Best,
Pete
