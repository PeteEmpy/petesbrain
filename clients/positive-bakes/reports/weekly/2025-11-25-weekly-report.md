## Week-over-Week Trends

### Daily Performance Pattern

**This Week Highlights:**
- **Nov 20 (Wednesday)**: P Max bid strategy changed from Max Conversions to Target ROAS 120%
- **Nov 21-24**: Learning period begins - performance fluctuations expected
- **Weekend vs Weekday**: [Data not available at daily level]

- Early signs positive: ROAS improvement despite learning period

---

## Black Friday Preparation

**Timeline Context:**
- Black Friday: 29 November (4 days away)
- Cyber Monday: 2 December (7 days away)
- Current week: Pre-holiday baseline establishment

**Key Considerations:**
1. **P Max Learning Period Timing**
   - Bid strategy change on Nov 20 means learning period ends Dec 4
   - Black Friday (Nov 29) falls during learning period
   - Results will be mixed: holiday shopping patterns + algorithm learning
   - Difficult to separate bid strategy performance from seasonal effects

2. **Shopping Campaign Readiness**
   - Shopping campaign performing well (137% ROAS)
   - Feed issues resolved (Shopify migration complete per CONTEXT.md)
   - Stock levels stable with Supabase
   - Campaign ready for holiday traffic

3. **Client Preparation in Progress**
   - Klaviyo cart flows being implemented
   - Christmas collections merchandising underway
   - Conversion optimisation work ongoing
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure all site changes are complete by Nov 27 to allow Google Analytics to stabilise before peak weekend

---

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. Allow P Max Learning Period to Complete (P2 - Monitor)
**Issue:** P Max campaign at 77% ROAS vs 120% target, in 14-day learning period following Nov 20 bid strategy change.

**Expected Impact:** Algorithm will optimise towards higher-value orders over next 9 days. Early signs positive (account-level conv value +51.5%).

**Action:**
- ✅ No changes required yet
- 📅 First review: Nov 27 (week 1 checkpoint)
- 📅 Full evaluation: Dec 4 (learning period ends)
- ⚠️ Note: Black Friday (Nov 29) will occur during learning period - results will be mixed with seasonal effects

**Timeline:** Review Nov 27

---

### 2. Consider Brand Campaign Budget Increase (P3 - Opportunity)
**Issue:** Brand campaign has 714% ROAS and 80.8% search impression share - missing 19.2% of potential brand searches.

**Expected Impact:** Capture additional £50-75/week in high-ROAS brand revenue with ~£10-15 additional spend.

**Action:**
- Increase daily budget from current level to capture remaining impression share
- Brand terms are highly profitable (£8.88 CPA vs £34.27 account average)
- Low risk given exceptional performance

**Timeline:** Can implement this week

---

### 3. Monitor Average Order Value Trend (P3 - Watch)
**Issue:** AOV increased from £29.65 to £53.10 (+79%) as P Max optimises for higher-value orders.

**Expected Impact:** If trend continues, could improve ROAS significantly but may reduce total conversion volume.

**Action:**
- Track AOV weekly to ensure it stabilises at sustainable level
- Compare to historical AOV data
- Ensure product mix remains balanced (not over-optimising for only highest-priced items)

**Timeline:** Weekly monitoring

---

## Strategic Notes

### Bid Strategy Change Impact Assessment

**Change Made:** Nov 20 - P Max switched from Max Conversions to Target ROAS 120%

**Reason for Change:** Campaign was converting but with poor order values (per CONTEXT.md)

**Week 1 Results (Nov 20-24):**
- ✅ Account ROAS nearly doubled (78% → 155%)
- ✅ Average order value up 79% (£29.65 → £53.10)
- ✅ Conversion value up 51.5% despite 23.5% lower spend
- ⚠️ Conversion volume down 15.4% (26 → 22)
- ⚠️ P Max campaign at 77% ROAS vs 120% target (in learning mode)

**Assessment:** Early signs very positive. The bid strategy is successfully optimising for higher-value orders. Full evaluation needed after Dec 4 learning period completion.

**Important Context:** Black Friday falls during learning period, which will make performance analysis more complex. Need to separate:
1. Bid strategy learning effects
2. Seasonal shopping behaviour
3. Site conversion optimisation (Klaviyo flows, Christmas merchandising)
