## Executive Summary

### Account-Level Performance

| Metric | This Week (Nov 11-17) | Last Period (Nov 8-10) | Change |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Spend** | £1,473 | £213 | **+590%** ⚠️ |
| **Conversions** | 42 | 8 | **+425%** ✓ |
| **Conv Value** | £1,583 | £216 | **+632%** ✓ |
| **ROAS** | **107%** | 101% | **+6pp** ~ |
| **CPA** | £35.07 | £26.63 | **+32%** ⚠️ |
| **Clicks** | 2,294 | 157 | **+1,361%** |
| **Impressions** | 210,131 | 23,640 | **+789%** |
| **CTR** | 1.09% | 0.66% | **+0.43pp** ✓ |
| **Avg CPC** | £0.64 | £1.36 | **-53%** ✓ |

**Key Takeaway:** **Massive scale-up week** - Spend increased 590% as campaigns ramped from learning phase. Volume metrics exploded but **ROAS remains critically low at 107%** (losing £0.93 per £1 spent on average). CPA increased 32% despite 425% more conversions.

**Critical Issue:** Account is **spending at a loss** - for every £100 spent, only generating £107 in revenue. This is unsustainable at current budget levels.

## Campaign Breakdown (Nov 11-17)

### 1. POS | Search | Brand 400 (Brand Search)
**Budget:** £63/day | **Channel:** Search
**Performance:**

| Metric | Value | % of Account |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Spend | £94 | 6% |
| Conversions | 9 | 21% |
| Conv Value | £190 | 12% |
| **ROAS** | **202%** ✓ | - |
| Clicks | 121 | 5% |
| Impressions | 353 | 0.2% |
| Avg CPC | £0.78 | - |

**Status:** ✅ **PROFITABLE** - Only campaign hitting positive ROAS
**Key Insight:** Brand search is the **foundation** of performance. Despite only 6% of spend, delivers 21% of conversions at 202% ROAS.

**Keyword Performance:**
- "positive bakes" (BROAD): 120 clicks, 9 conv, £190 value, £94 spend
- Driving 99% of brand campaign volume
- Highly efficient at £0.78 CPC vs account average £0.64

**Recommendation:** **Protect this campaign** - It's the only profitable channel. Consider modest budget increase to £80-100/day if budget limited elsewhere.

### 2. POS | P Max 300 (Performance Max)
**Budget:** £35/day | **Channel:** Performance Max
**Performance:**

| Metric | Value | % of Account |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Spend | £452 | 31% |
| Conversions | 10 | 24% |
| Conv Value | £298 | 19% |
| **ROAS** | **66%** ⚠️ | - |
| Clicks | 885 | 39% |
| Impressions | 73,853 | 35% |
| Avg CPC | £0.51 | - |

**Status:** 🔴 **LOSING MONEY** - Spending £100 to make £66
**Daily Avg:** £64.57 spend (84% over £35 budget)

**Asset Group Analysis:**
| Asset Group | Spend | Conv | Conv Value | ROAS |
|-------------|-------|------|------------|------|
| All Products | £452 | 10 | £298 | **66%** |
| Generic - Bestsellers | £0 | 0 | £0 | - |
| Remarketing - Not Bestsellers | £0 | 0 | £0 | - |
| Competitors - Bestsellers | £0 | 0 | £0 | - |

**Critical Finding:** Only 1 of 4 asset groups is active. "All Products" asset group is:
- Running at massive loss (66% ROAS = -£154 lost on £452 spend)
- Over budget by 84% daily
- Dragging down overall account performance

**Daily Trend (PMax):**
| Date | Spend | Conv | ROAS | Issue |
|------|-------|------|------|-------|
| Nov 11 | £63 | 1 | 47% | Learning |
| Nov 12 | £67 | 1 | 49% | Learning |
| Nov 13 | £65 | 0 | 0% | ⚠️ Zero conv |
| Nov 14 | £63 | 2 | 85% | Improving |
| Nov 15 | £71 | 2 | 137% | ✓ Profit |
| Nov 16 | £53 | 3 | 103% | Break-even |
| Nov 17 | £70 | 1 | 43% | ⚠️ Collapse |

**Pattern:** Highly volatile. Only 1 of 7 days profitable. No consistency.

**Recommendation:** **URGENT - Reduce PMax budget to £20/day** or pause entirely. Current £35/day budget is burning money with no path to profitability. Need to stop the bleeding.

### 3. POS | Shopping | Free From Not Bestsellers (Standard Shopping)
**Budget:** £60/day | **Channel:** Shopping
**Performance:**

| Metric | Value | % of Account |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Spend | £689 | 47% |
| Conversions | 13 | 31% |
| Conv Value | £683 | 43% |
| **ROAS** | **99%** ⚠️ | - |
| Clicks | 455 | 20% |
| Impressions | 70,708 | 34% |
| Avg CPC | £1.51 | - |

**Status:** 🟡 **BREAK-EVEN** - Spending £100 to make £99 (essentially flat)
**Daily Avg:** £98.43 spend (64% over £60 budget)

**Daily Trend (Shopping Not Bestsellers):**
| Date | Spend | Conv | Conv Value | ROAS |
|------|-------|------|------------|------|
| Nov 11 | £68 | 0.5 | £28 | 41% |
| Nov 12 | £68 | 4.5 | £175 | **257%** ✓ |
| Nov 13 | £68 | 0 | £0 | 0% |
| Nov 14 | £68 | 0 | £0 | 0% |
| Nov 15 | £67 | 0 | £0 | 0% |
| Nov 16 | £33 | 0 | £0 | 0% |
| Nov 17 | £66 | 1 | £30 | 45% |

**Critical Finding:** **5 out of 7 days produced ZERO conversions** despite spending £68/day. Only Nov 12 was profitable (257% ROAS with 4.5 conv).

**Why the inconsistency?**
- Nov 12: 4.5 conversions, £175 value (likely one large order)
- Rest of week: Near-zero performance
- Suggests campaign is relying on occasional high-value orders rather than consistent performance

**Recommendation:** **PAUSE or reduce to £30/day test budget**. Cannot justify £60/day when 5 of 7 days produce zero return.

---

### 4. POS | Shopping | Free From Bestsellers (Standard Shopping)
**Budget:** £44/day | **Channel:** Shopping
**Performance:**

| Metric | Value | % of Account |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Spend | £0.58 | <1% |
| Conversions | 0 | 0% |
| Conv Value | £0 | 0% |
| **ROAS** | **0%** | - |
| Clicks | 3 | <1% |
| Impressions | 301 | <1% |

**Status:** ⚫ **INACTIVE** - Essentially not running (only £0.58 spend in 7 days)
**Finding:** Budget set to £44/day but campaign getting no traffic.

**Why?**
- Likely outbid by other campaigns
- Product group settings may be too restrictive
- Could be paused most of the week

**Recommendation:** **Review and activate OR remove budget** - £44/day allocated budget doing nothing. Reallocate to Brand Search if can't fix.

## Product-Level Deep Dive (Shopping Performance)

### Top 10 Products by Spend (Nov 11-17)

| Rank | Product | Spend | Conv | Conv Value | ROAS | Clicks | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|------|------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Signature Brownie & Blondie Selection (25pc) | £134 | 3.5 | £118 | **88%** | 89 | ⚠️ Loss |
| 2 | Luxury Tart Selection Box (6pc) | £89 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 139 | 🔴 Zero conv |
| 3 | Artisan Cookie Collection (6pc) | £61 | 1 | £27 | **43%** | 89 | 🔴 Major loss |
| 4 | Artisan Brownie & Blondie (12pc) | £55 | 2 | £80 | **145%** ✓ | 40 | Profitable |
| 5 | Signature Bundt Cake Selection | £37 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 39 | 🔴 Zero conv |
| 6 | Ultimate Christmas Feast Hamper | £32 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 41 | 🔴 Zero conv |
| 7 | Luxury Cheesecake Selection (5pc) | £30 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 61 | 🔴 Zero conv |
| 8 | Thinking of You Cookie Collection | £24 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 14 | 🔴 Zero conv |
| 9 | Luxury Cream Tea for 2 | £22 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 25 | 🔴 Zero conv |
| 10 | Corporate Sharing Brownie & Blondie (25pc) | £20 | 0 | £0 | **0%** | 13 | 🔴 Zero conv |

**Analysis:**

**✅ Winners** (Scale these):
- **Artisan Brownie & Blondie Collection (12pc):** Only product with strong ROAS (145%). Spent £55, generated £80. Scale this.
- **Signature Brownie & Blondie (25pc):** High volume (89 clicks, 3.5 conv) but at 88% ROAS. Close to break-even, monitor.

**🔴 Major Losers** (Pause/exclude these):
- **Luxury Tart Selection Box:** Highest click volume (139) but ZERO conversions. Burning £89.
- **Luxury Cheesecake Selection:** 61 clicks, ZERO conversions. Wasted £30.
- **Bundt Cake Selection:** 39 clicks, ZERO conversions. Wasted £37.
- **Christmas Feast Hamper:** 41 clicks, ZERO conversions. Wasted £32.

**Pattern:** Products with "Luxury" in the title are getting clicks but not converting. Possible issues:
- Price point too high for cold traffic
- Landing page not matching ad expectations
- Product images/descriptions not compelling enough
- Wrong audience targeting

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. **Pause or exclude** the 6 products with 0% ROAS (Tart, Cheesecake, Bundt, Hamper, Cream Tea, Corporate)
2. **Create separate high-performing product group** for Artisan Brownie & Blondie 12pc
3. **Reduce bids by 30-40%** on all "Luxury" products until they prove conversion ability

## Week-over-Week Comparison

### This Week (Nov 11-17) vs Last Partial Week (Nov 8-10)

**Note:** Last period only has 3 days of meaningful data (Nov 8-10), so percentages inflated.

| Metric | Nov 11-17 | Nov 8-10 | Change | Normalized Daily Avg |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Spend | £1,473 | £213 | +590% | £210/day vs £71/day |
| Conversions | 42 | 8 | +425% | 6.0/day vs 2.7/day |
| Conv Value | £1,583 | £216 | +632% | £226/day vs £72/day |
| ROAS | 107% | 101% | +6pp | Similar efficiency |
| Clicks | 2,294 | 157 | +1,361% | 328/day vs 52/day |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Volume scaled dramatically** - Daily spend tripled (£71 → £210/day)
2. **Efficiency barely improved** - ROAS went from 101% to 107% (both unprofitable)
3. **Scale revealed issues** - At low spend, break-even looked acceptable. At scale, losing £137/week.

**Implication:** Current account structure **cannot profitably scale**. More spend = more losses at current efficiency.

## Daily Performance Breakdown (Nov 11-17)

### Account-Wide Daily Trends

| Date | Spend | Conv | Conv Value | ROAS | Day Type | Notes |
|------|-------|------|------------|------|----------|-------|
| **Nov 11** | £147 | 3 | £94 | 64% | Monday | Weak start |
| **Nov 12** | £148 | 7 | £210 | **142%** ✓ | Tuesday | **Best day** |
| **Nov 13** | £148 | 1 | £0 | 0% | Wednesday | Disaster |
| **Nov 14** | £152 | 4 | £119 | 78% | Thursday | Below target |
| **Nov 15** | £153 | 4 | £127 | 83% | Friday | Below target |
| **Nov 16** | £95 | 4 | £85 | 89% | Saturday | Budget cut |
| **Nov 17** | £147 | 2 | £87 | 59% | Sunday | Weak close |

**Patterns Identified:**
1. **Tuesday (Nov 12) was an anomaly** - 142% ROAS driven primarily by Shopping campaign's 4.5 conversions (£175 value)
2. **Wednesday (Nov 13) was a disaster** - Spent £148, generated £0. All campaigns failed simultaneously.
3. **Weekend performance weak** - Saturday/Sunday below weekday average
4. **No clear day-of-week pattern** - Performance highly erratic

**Average Weekday vs Weekend:**
- **Weekdays (Mon-Fri):** £150/day spend, 3.8 conv/day, 85% ROAS
- **Weekend (Sat-Sun):** £121/day spend, 3.0 conv/day, 74% ROAS
- **Winner:** Weekdays marginally better, but both unprofitable

---

## Root Cause Analysis: Why is ROAS So Low?

### Problem Statement
Account spending £1,473/week generating only £1,583/week revenue = **107% ROAS** (losing money).

### Investigated Causes

#### 1. ✅ **Campaign Mix Problem**
**Finding:** 78% of spend (£1,141) going to campaigns running at massive loss:
- PMax: £452 spend, 66% ROAS (-£154 lost)
- Shopping Not Bestsellers: £689 spend, 99% ROAS (-£6 lost)
- Only £94 (6%) going to profitable Brand Search (202% ROAS)

**Impact:** **HIGH** - Majority of budget burning on unprofitable channels
**Fix:** Reallocate budget from losers to Brand Search

---

#### 2. ✅ **Product Selection Problem**
**Finding:** Top spending products have 0% conversion rate:
- 6 of top 10 products by spend: Zero conversions
- £232 wasted on products that don't convert (Luxury Tart £89, Bundt £37, Hamper £32, Cheesecake £30, etc.)
- Only 1 product (Artisan Brownie 12pc) running profitably

**Impact:** **CRITICAL** - Nearly 16% of total spend on zero-converting products
**Fix:** Exclude non-performing products immediately

---

#### 3. ✅ **Learning Phase / Algorithm Issue**
**Finding:** PMax campaign showing high volatility:
- Nov 13: 0% ROAS (zero conversions)
- Nov 15: 137% ROAS (profitable)
- Nov 17: 43% ROAS (major loss)
- Pattern suggests algorithm hasn't stabilized

**Impact:** **MODERATE** - Contributes to unpredictability but not root cause
**Fix:** May need campaign restart with better product exclusions

---

#### 4. ✅ **Budget Overspend Problem**
**Finding:** Campaigns spending well above set budgets:
- PMax: £35/day budget → £64/day actual (84% over)
- Shopping Not Bestsellers: £60/day budget → £98/day actual (64% over)
- Account spending £210/day vs £202/day total budgets

**Impact:** **MODERATE** - Overspend happening on losing campaigns
**Fix:** Enable "Campaign total" budget type or adjust shared budgets

---

#### 5. ⚠️ **Conversion Tracking Issue?**
**Finding:** Need to verify:
- Recent Shopify migration (BigCommerce → Shopify) may have affected tracking
- CONTEXT.md notes "Product ID Discontinuity" issue resolved Nov 11
- Could be lingering attribution issues

**Impact:** **UNKNOWN** - Cannot confirm without audit
**Next Step:** Verify Google Analytics & Google Ads conversion tags post-migration

---

#### 6. ⚠️ **Price Point / AOV Problem**
**Finding:**
- CPA = £35.07 per conversion
- Conv Value = £37.69 average (£1,583 / 42 conv)
- **Gross Margin:** Only £2.62 per conversion before ad spend!

**Calculation:**
- Average order generates £37.69 revenue
- Costs £35.07 to acquire
- Net: £2.62 profit per order
- **This assumes 100% margin** - if margin is <90%, account is losing money even with conversions

**Impact:** **CRITICAL** - If product margins <90%, account cannot be profitable at any scale
**Fix:** Either:
  1. Increase AOV (upsells, bundles, minimum order value)
  2. Reduce CPA below £25 (30% improvement needed)
  3. Focus only on higher-AOV products (hampers, corporate orders)

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### 🔴 URGENT (This Week)

#### 1. **Stop the Bleeding - Immediate Budget Cuts**
**Current:** £202/day budgets → £210/day actual spend
**Recommended:** £80-100/day total

**New Budget Allocation:**
| Campaign | Current Budget | New Budget | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Brand Search | £63/day | **£50-60/day** | Only profitable campaign, maintain/protect |
| PMax | £35/day | **£15/day or PAUSE** | 66% ROAS unsustainable |
| Shopping Not Bestsellers | £60/day | **£15-25/day** | 99% ROAS, too many zero-conv days |
| Shopping Bestsellers | £44/day | **PAUSE** | Not running anyway, reclaim budget |

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce daily spend from £210 → £80-100
- Reduce weekly losses from £137 → £50-80
- Give profitable Brand Search more room to scale

**Implementation:** Today (Nov 20)

---

#### 2. **Exclude Zero-Converting Products**
**Action:** Add negative product groups or product exclusions for:
- Luxury Tart Selection Box (ID: 52068410654987) - Wasted £89
- Luxury Cheesecake Selection (ID: 52068411998475) - Wasted £30
- Signature Bundt Cake Selection (ID: 52070909214987) - Wasted £37
- Ultimate Christmas Feast Hamper (ID: 52382253744395) - Wasted £32
- Luxury Cream Tea for 2 (ID: 52068289282315) - Wasted £22
- Thinking of You Cookie Collection (ID: 52068407017739) - Wasted £24

**Total waste prevented:** £234/week (16% of current spend)

**Implementation:** Today (Nov 20) - Add to Shopping campaigns

---

#### 3. **Conversion Tracking Audit**
**Concern:** Post-Shopify migration, need to verify:
1. Google Ads conversion tag firing correctly
2. Google Analytics 4 ecommerce events tracking
3. Enhanced conversions enabled
4. Transaction IDs being passed (avoid duplicates)

**Action:**
- Place test order on site
- Verify it appears in Google Ads within 24 hours
- Check GA4 Purchase event fires
- Confirm product IDs matching Merchant Center feed

**Implementation:** Tomorrow (Nov 21)

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Next 7 Days)

#### 4. **Create High-Performing Product Campaign**
**Finding:** Only 1 product profitable (Artisan Brownie & Blondie 12pc - 145% ROAS)

**Action:** Create dedicated Shopping campaign:
- **Name:** "POS | Shopping | Proven Winners"
- **Products:** Only Artisan Brownie & Blondie Collection 12pc initially
- **Budget:** £30/day
- **Target ROAS:** 200% (conservative given 145% current)
- **Add products only after they prove 150%+ ROAS** in other campaigns

**Expected Outcome:** £30/day spend at 150% ROAS = £45/day revenue = £15/day profit

**Implementation:** Nov 21-22

---

#### 5. **Fix PMax Asset Groups**
**Finding:** Only 1 of 4 asset groups active ("All Products")

**Inactive Groups:**
- Generic - Bestsellers
- Remarketing - Not Bestsellers
- Competitors - Bestsellers

**Action:**
- Review asset group setup (likely missing audience signals or creative assets)
- Either activate remaining 3 groups OR remove them to simplify
- Ensure "All Products" excludes the zero-converting products (see #2 above)

**Implementation:** Nov 22-23

---

#### 6. **AOV Optimization Test**
**Problem:** £37.69 average order value vs £35.07 CPA = only £2.62 margin before product costs

**Actions to test:**
1. **Add free shipping threshold:** "Free delivery on orders £50+" (force larger baskets)
2. **Create product bundles:** "Buy 2 boxes, save 15%"
3. **Cross-sell at cart:** "Customers who bought X also bought Y"
4. **Minimum order value:** Consider £25-30 minimum for plant-based specialty products

**Target:** Increase AOV from £37.69 → £50+ (33% increase)
**Impact:** Would improve ROAS from 107% → 143% at current CPA

**Implementation:** Work with Aatin to implement on site (Nov 22-25)

---

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next 2 Weeks)

#### 7. **Search Terms Analysis & Negative Keywords**
**Need:** Unable to pull search terms in this analysis (API limitation)

**Action:**
- Export search terms report from Google Ads UI
- Identify irrelevant queries burning budget
- Add as negative keywords (campaign or account level)
- Focus on PMax and Shopping campaigns

**Implementation:** Week of Nov 25

---

#### 8. **Landing Page Optimization**
**Hypothesis:** High click volume on "Luxury" products suggests ads compelling but landing pages failing

**Test:**
- A/B test landing pages for Luxury Tart Selection (139 clicks, 0 conv)
- Add customer reviews/testimonials
- Clearer value proposition
- Stronger call-to-action
- Trust signals (plant-based certification, awards, etc.)

**Implementation:** Week of Nov 25 (requires dev/design work)

---

#### 9. **Competitor Analysis**
**Finding:** No data on competitive landscape

**Action:**
- Use Auction Insights report to see who's competing for same traffic
- Analyze competitor ad copy and landing pages
- Identify gaps in product offering or positioning
- Check if competitors offering better prices/shipping

**Implementation:** Week of Nov 25

---
