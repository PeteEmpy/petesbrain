## Comparison to Strategy Assumptions

### 1. **UK Market Analysis**

**Strategy Assumption:**
- Baseline ROAS target: 430% (4.3)
- Daily budget: £2,716
- Expected early performance: Establish strong baseline, maintain or exceed 430% ROAS

**Actual Results (Oct 29 - Nov 10):**
- Actual ROAS: **332%** (3.32)
- Average daily spend: £2,853/day (+5% vs budget)
- Average daily revenue: £9,466/day

**Assessment:** 🟡 **MONITORING - ROAS Below Target But Volume Strong**

**What's Happening:**
- ROAS is **-23% below baseline target** (332% vs 430%)
- However, **spend is pacing well** and **revenue is strong**
- This suggests the market is absorbing budget well, but at a slightly lower efficiency
- Nov 15 ROAS reduction (430% → 380%) may need reconsideration - we're already at 332%

**Critical Question:** Should we proceed with Nov 15 ROAS reduction to 380%?
- Current ROAS (332%) is already **below the Nov 15 target** (380%)
- **Recommendation:** HOLD at 430% target, monitor for 3 more days before Dec 1 decision
- Reducing targets further risks unprofitable volume

---

### 2. **USA Market Analysis**

**Strategy Assumption:**
- Baseline ROAS target: 250% (2.5)
- Daily budget: $2,264 (£1,789)
- Expected early performance: Establish baseline, 250%+ ROAS

**Actual Results (Nov 1 - Nov 10, 10 days):**
- Actual ROAS: **423%** (4.23)
- Average daily spend: £389/day (only 22% of budget - underspending)
- Average daily revenue: £1,300/day

**Assessment:** 🟢 **EXCELLENT - Far Exceeding Target**

**What's Happening:**
- ROAS is **+173 percentage points above target** (423% vs 250%)
- Massively underspending (~£1,400/day below budget)
- Efficiency is exceptional, but **we're leaving money on the table**

**Critical Recommendation: INCREASE USA BUDGET IMMEDIATELY**
- Current performance suggests we could spend £3,000-4,000/day profitably
- At 423% ROAS, every £1 spent returns £4.23
- **This is the biggest opportunity in Q4**
- Nov 25 Thanksgiving boost will help, but we should accelerate sooner

**Action Required:** Push daily spend from £389 → £1,500+ before Thanksgiving (Nov 25)

---

### 3. **EUR Market Analysis**

**Strategy Assumption:**
- Baseline ROAS target: 150% (1.5)
- Daily budget: €868 (£747)
- Expected early performance: Establish baseline, 150%+ ROAS
- Known issue: GA4 conversion tracking (being fixed)

**Actual Results (Oct 29 - Nov 10, 13 days):**
- Actual ROAS: **388%** (3.88)
- Average daily spend: £71/day (only 10% of budget - severe underspending)
- Average daily revenue: £276/day

**Assessment:** 🟢 **EXCEPTIONAL - But Underspending Severely**

**What's Happening:**
- ROAS is **+238 percentage points above target** (388% vs 150%)
- Spending only £71/day vs £747/day budget (90% underspend!)
- Conversion tracking issues may be affecting Smart Bidding's ability to spend

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Conversion tracking fix is URGENT** - GA4 issue limiting spend
2. EUR could be generating £6,000+/day revenue at this ROAS if properly scaled
3. This is the **second-biggest missed opportunity** after USA

**Action Required:**
1. Escalate GA4 conversion tracking fix with Beth/Google (priority #1)
2. Once fixed, aggressively scale budget
3. At 388% ROAS, EUR could be a £50K+/month market

---

### 4. **ROW Market Analysis**

**Strategy Assumption:**
- Launch date: Nov 15, 2025
- Baseline ROAS target: 100% (1.0)
- Daily budget: £354
- Conservative expectations: Break-even, exploratory

**Actual Results (Nov 5 - Nov 10, 6 days - LAUNCHED EARLY!):**
- Actual ROAS: **595%** (5.95) 🚀
- Average daily spend: £93/day (26% of budget - underspending)
- Average daily revenue: £551/day

**Assessment:** 🟢 **OUTSTANDING - Far Exceeds All Expectations**

**What's Happening:**
- **ROW launched 10 days early** (Nov 5 vs Nov 15 planned)
- ROAS is **+495 percentage points above target** (595% vs 100%)
- Massively profitable but heavily constrained by budget/bidding

**Critical Discovery:**
- ROW (Singapore, Australia, Canada) is THE MOST EFFICIENT MARKET
- At 595% ROAS, every £1 returns £5.95
- Current revenue: £551/day, but could scale to £2,000+/day at this efficiency

**Action Required:**
1. **INCREASE ROW BUDGET IMMEDIATELY** - double from £93/day → £200/day
2. Reconsider Dec 1 budget cut (£354 → £333/day) - this is wrong direction
3. ROW is outperforming UK - it deserves more investment, not less

## Conversion Rate Assumptions vs Reality

### Strategy Conversion Rate Assumptions (Q4 2024 Baseline):
- UK: 10.15% peak (November)
- USA: 4.35% (December)
- EUR: Data not specified
- ROW: Data not specified

### Current Conversion Tracking Issues:
- **UK**: ✅ Google Ads conversion tracking (accurate)
- **USA**: ✅ Google Ads conversion tracking (accurate)
- **EUR**: ⚠️ GA4 conversion tracking (being fixed)
- **ROW**: ⚠️ GA4 conversion tracking (being fixed)

**Impact:** EUR and ROW conversion data may be understated due to GA4 tracking issues, which could explain the underspending despite exceptional ROAS.

---

## Budget Pacing Analysis

### Q4 Budget: £367,014 over 91 days = £4,033/day average

**Actual Spend (13 days, Oct 29 - Nov 10):**
- Total Spend: £41,640
- Average Daily Spend: £3,203/day
- **Budget Pacing: 79.4%** (£830/day below target)

**Assessment:** 🟡 **UNDERSPENDING - Need to Scale**

**Where We're Underspending:**
1. **USA**: £1,400/day below budget (biggest gap)
2. **EUR**: £676/day below budget (second biggest gap)
3. **ROW**: £261/day below budget
4. **UK**: Actually overspending by £137/day (good!)

**Total Daily Underspend: £2,200/day**

If this continues, we'll leave **£200,000+ revenue on the table** by Dec 31.

## Strategic Recommendations: What Actions to Take Now

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 1: Accelerate USA Spending (Immediate)**

**Current:** £389/day spend, 423% ROAS
**Target:** £1,500/day by Nov 15
**Why:** At 423% ROAS, we're leaving £30K+/month revenue on table
**Action:** Increase daily budgets, reduce ROAS targets to allow more spend

---

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 2: Fix EUR Conversion Tracking (Urgent)**

**Current:** £71/day spend, 388% ROAS (GA4 tracking issue)
**Target:** £400+/day by Nov 20
**Why:** EUR has 388% ROAS but can't spend due to tracking
**Action:** Escalate with Beth/Google, get Google Ads conversion tracking live

---

### 🔥 **PRIORITY 3: Scale ROW Immediately**

**Current:** £93/day spend, 595% ROAS
**Target:** £200+/day by Nov 15
**Why:** ROW is THE most efficient market (595% ROAS!)
**Action:** Increase budgets, cancel Dec 1 budget cut plan

---

### ⚠️ **PRIORITY 4: Reconsider Nov 15 UK ROAS Reduction**

**Current:** UK at 332% ROAS (below 430% baseline)
**Planned:** Nov 15: Reduce ROAS target 430% → 380%
**Issue:** We're already at 332%, below the "reduced" target!
**Action:** **HOLD at 430%** - don't reduce further, monitor through Nov 25

---

### ⚠️ **PRIORITY 5: Rethink ALL Dec 1 Budget Cuts**

**Planned Dec 1 Changes:**
- EUR: €868 → €817/day (-6%)
- ROW: £354 → £333/day (-6%)

**Issue:** Both EUR (388% ROAS) and ROW (595% ROAS) are massively profitable
**Recommendation:** **CANCEL BOTH CUTS** - instead, increase budgets for both

---

## Assumptions That Were WRONG

### ❌ **Assumption 1: UK Would Maintain 430% ROAS Baseline**
- **Reality:** UK at 332% ROAS (-23% vs target)
- **Why Wrong:** Seasonal demand hasn't peaked yet, or competition increased
- **Impact:** Moderate - volume is still strong

### ❌ **Assumption 2: USA Needs Conservative 250% ROAS Target**
- **Reality:** USA delivering 423% ROAS (+69% vs target)
- **Why Wrong:** USA market is far more efficient than 2024 baseline
- **Impact:** MAJOR - we're underspending the best opportunity

### ❌ **Assumption 3: EUR Only Profitable at 150% ROAS**
- **Reality:** EUR delivering 388% ROAS (+159% vs target)
- **Why Wrong:** EUR market is far more efficient than expected (or tracking was bad in 2024)
- **Impact:** MAJOR - GA4 tracking fix unlocks huge potential

### ❌ **Assumption 4: ROW is Break-Even Exploratory Market (100% ROAS)**
- **Reality:** ROW delivering 595% ROAS (+495% vs target!)
- **Why Wrong:** Singapore/Australia/Canada are incredibly efficient luxury markets
- **Impact:** MASSIVE - ROW should receive 3x current investment

### ❌ **Assumption 5: Budget Cuts Needed for EUR/ROW in December**
- **Reality:** Both are massively profitable and underspending
- **Why Wrong:** Based on 2024 data that may have had tracking issues
- **Impact:** Critical - Dec 1 cuts would hurt profitability

---

## Assumptions That Were RIGHT ✅

### ✅ **Phased ROAS Reduction Strategy**
- Concept is sound - we should reduce ROAS targets to scale volume
- **But timing needs adjustment** - UK already below Nov 15 target

### ✅ **Multi-Regional Approach**
- Different ROAS targets by market maturity was correct
- **But the actual targets were too conservative** for USA/EUR/ROW

### ✅ **Q4 Seasonality Opportunity**
- Early results confirm Q4 is profitable period
- **Revenue potential is even higher than projected**

---

## Overall Assessment

### Where We Are

**13 days into Q4 (14% of period):**
- ✅ Revenue: 18.3% of target (ahead of pace!)
- ⚠️ Spend: 11.3% of budget (underspending)
- ✅ ROAS: 343% overall (excellent)
- 🟢 On track to EXCEED revenue target by 29%+

### Critical Insights

1. **USA is the biggest opportunity** - scale immediately
2. **EUR conversion tracking fix unlocks £50K+/month revenue**
3. **ROW is the surprise winner** - most efficient market
4. **UK needs monitoring** - ROAS below target but volume strong
5. **All planned budget cuts should be cancelled** - every region is profitable

### What We Need to Do Differently

1. **Abandon conservative assumptions** - all regions outperforming
2. **Accelerate budget increases** - we're leaving money on table
3. **Fix EUR/ROW tracking ASAP** - blocking spend
4. **Reconsider all ROAS reductions** - especially UK
5. **Increase ROW investment** - not decrease it

---

## Next Review Points

1. **Nov 15 (4 days):** Reassess UK ROAS decision, evaluate USA scaling progress
2. **Nov 20:** EUR tracking fix deadline - has spend increased?
3. **Nov 25:** USA Thanksgiving performance - did boost work?
4. **Dec 1:** Full month review - reconsider ALL Dec 1 changes

---

## Summary for Client Communication

**Key Messages:**

1. 🟢 **Q4 strategy is working** - on track to exceed £780K target by 29%
2. 🚀 **USA, EUR, and ROW are huge opportunities** - currently underspending
3. ⚠️ **UK performing below ROAS target** - needs monitoring but volume strong
4. 🔥 **Three immediate actions needed:**
   - Scale USA spending (423% ROAS, only using 22% of budget)
   - Fix EUR conversion tracking (388% ROAS, only using 10% of budget)
   - Increase ROW budget (595% ROAS - the most efficient market!)
5. 🎯 **New target potential:** £1.35M+ Q4 revenue if we scale properly

**Bottom Line:** The strategy fundamentals are sound, but we were **too conservative** on USA, EUR, and ROW. Every region is profitable - we should invest more, not less.
