- (Plus general gifting themes)

---

---

## USA Account - Key Differences

Based on the pattern from UK, USA likely has:

**Main H&S Campaign:**
- "Heroes & Sidekicks" (renamed, generic themes)
- Category-specific asset groups (Card Holders, Notebooks, etc.) with 49-50 themes each
- "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" PAUSED (previously had Christmas themes)
- Competitors and Remarketing asset groups (no themes, audience-based)

**Christmas Gifting Campaign:**
- "Christmas Gifting for Her" (Christmas-specific themes)
- "Christmas Gifting for Him" (Christmas-specific themes)
- "Heroes & Sidekicks - Christmas Gifting" (generic Christmas themes)

---

## Listing Groups (Product Groups) Analysis

### Current State: NO Custom Listing Groups

**All asset groups show:**
```
📦 Listing Groups: None (all products)
```

**What this means:**
- Every asset group is eligible to show ALL products from the Merchant Center feed
- No filtering by custom_label_0, custom_label_1, category, brand, etc.
- The supplemental feeds you created (Travel Bags, Card Holders, Jewellery Boxes) are NOT being used for filtering

**Potential Issue:**
- "Card Holders" asset group can show travel bags, notebooks, diaries, etc.
- "Notebooks" asset group can show card holders, jewellery boxes, etc.
- Only the search themes and landing page URL guide the asset group focus

**Recommendation:**
Consider adding listing group filters to ensure:
- "Card Holders" asset group ONLY shows products with custom_label_0 = "Card Holders"
- "Travel Bags" asset group ONLY shows products with custom_label_0 = "Travel Bags"
- "Jewellery Boxes" asset group ONLY shows products with custom_label_0 = "Jewellery Boxes"
- Etc.

This would make asset groups more focused and prevent irrelevant product showing for specific search themes.

## Changes Made to Search Themes (Based on Asset Group Status Changes)

### What Changed:

1. **"Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting" → "Heroes & Sidekicks"**
   - Renamed but search themes KEPT THE SAME
   - Still has broad gifting themes ("luxury gifts for her/him", "luxury christmas gifts for him")
   - But does NOT have Christmas-specific themes like "christmas luxury leather gifts"
   - Landing URL changed to generic homepage (https://www.smythson.com/uk) instead of gifting page

2. **"Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" in Main H&S → PAUSED**
   - These had DUPLICATE Christmas gifting themes
   - Themes included: "christmas luxury leather gifts", "Luxury christmas gifts for her/him"
   - By pausing these, eliminated duplication with Christmas campaign

3. **Christmas Campaign Asset Groups → RENAMED**
   - "Gifting for Her" → "Christmas Gifting for Her"
   - "Gifting for Him" → "Christmas Gifting for Him"
   - "Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting" → "Heroes & Sidekicks - Christmas Gifting"
   - Themes likely UNCHANGED (still Christmas-focused)

---

## Summary of Search Theme Strategy

### Main H&S Campaign:
**Purpose:** Year-round product discovery
**Search themes:** Product-focused, category-specific, some generic gifting
**Landing pages:** Category pages (e.g., /card-holders, /notebooks, /travel-bags)

### Christmas Gifting Campaign:
**Purpose:** Seasonal Christmas gifting (Oct-Dec)
**Search themes:** Christmas-specific gifting themes + gender-specific
**Landing pages:** Gifting pages (/gifts/gifts-for-her, /gifts/gifts-for-him, /christmas.html)

### Key Insight:
The search themes are HEAVILY populated (49-50 per asset group in most cases). This is excellent for giving Google's algorithm strong signals about what searches should trigger each asset group.

However, the LACK of custom listing group filters means products aren't actually restricted by asset group - Google can show any product for any search theme based on its own logic.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Custom Listing Group Filters
**Priority:** HIGH

For asset groups with supplemental feeds (Card Holders, Travel Bags, Jewellery Boxes), add listing group filters:

**Example - Card Holders Asset Group:**
```
Listing Group Filter:
- custom_label_0 = "Card Holders"
```

This ensures ONLY card holder products show in this asset group.

**Why:** Currently, Google could show notebooks or travel bags when someone searches "luxury card holder" in the Card Holders asset group, which would be suboptimal.

---

### 2. Review "Heroes & Sidekicks" Search Themes
**Priority:** MEDIUM

The generic "Heroes & Sidekicks" asset group still has gifting themes like:
- "luxury gifts for her"
- "luxury gifts for him"
- "luxury christmas gifts for him"
- "personalised luxury gifts for him/her"

**Consider:**
- Remove Christmas-specific themes from this asset group
- Keep generic gifting themes (they work year-round)
- OR create a separate "Gifting - General" asset group for non-Christmas gifting searches

---

### 3. Monitor Christmas vs Main H&S Performance
**Priority:** HIGH

**Key metrics to watch:**
- Are Christmas asset groups getting more impressions/clicks now that duplicates are paused?
- Is Main H&S "Heroes & Sidekicks" still capturing some gifting traffic (as intended)?
- Are there any lost impressions/clicks from pausing the duplicates?

**Timeline:** First 7-14 days critical

---

### 4. Consider Landing Page Optimization
**Priority:** LOW

"Heroes & Sidekicks" asset group now lands on homepage (https://www.smythson.com/uk) instead of a dedicated gifting page.

**Consider:**
- Does homepage make sense for "luxury gifts for her" searches?
- OR should it land on a gifts landing page?
- OR remove gifting themes from this asset group entirely?
