- **Purpose:** Keep campaigns warm, prep for sale
- **No action needed** - this is the plan

### 2. Christmas Eve Sale Launch (Tue 24 Dec, 6pm)

### 3. Boxing Day Opportunity (Thu 26 Dec)
- **Planned:** £8,000
- **Buffer Available:** £22,500
- **Opportunity:** If Dec 24-25 performance is strong (>600% ROAS), consider increasing to £12,000

### 4. P9 Closeout (Sat 28 Dec)
- P9 ends Dec 28 (NOT Dec 31)
