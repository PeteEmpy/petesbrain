## What Happens Next

### Immediate Action Required: Translation

**DE, IT, and FR campaigns require translation** before they can be built:

| Language | Text Assets to Translate |
|----------|--------------------------|
| German (DE) | 91 assets (Gifting: 50, Diaries: 41) |
| Italian (IT) | 91 assets (Gifting: 50, Diaries: 41) |
| French (FR) | 91 assets (Gifting: 50, Diaries: 41) |
| **Total** | **273 text assets** |

**Translation Requirements**:
- Maintain luxury brand voice (heritage, craftsmanship, elegance)
- Keep "Smythson of Bond Street™" in English
- Respect character limits (Headlines: 30 chars, Long Headlines: 90 chars, Descriptions: 90 chars)
- Cultural adaptation where appropriate

**Question for you**: Do you want me to:
1. Arrange translation through Smythson's usual translation service?
2. Use AI translation with native speaker review?
3. Send the English text assets to your in-house team for translation?

### Campaign Build Process

Once translations are ready:

1. **Google Ads Editor Setup** (1-2 hours)
   - Import UK campaign templates
   - Create 10 new campaigns with correct settings
   - Add translated text assets (DE/IT/FR)
   - Configure geographic targeting
   - Set regional budgets and Target ROAS

2. **EUR Account Import** (8 campaigns)
   - DE Gifting + Diaries
   - IT Gifting + Diaries
   - FR Gifting + Diaries
   - EU Gifting + Diaries

3. **ROW Account Import** (2 campaigns)
   - ROW Gifting + Diaries

4. **All campaigns will be created in PAUSED status** for your review

### Budget Allocation Recommended

| Region | Daily Budget | Target ROAS |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| DE | £250/day | 120-150% |
| IT | £125/day | 120-150% |
| FR | £125/day | 120-150% |
| EU (Other) | £175/day | 120-150% |
| ROW | £250/day | 90-100% |
| **Total** | **£925/day** | Regional |

These budgets are based on:
- Q4 2025 international performance data
- EUR account: 78% Germany, 9.5% France, 8.9% Italy
- ROW account: 134+ countries, lower ROAS tolerance
- Christmas gifting seasonality (Nov-Dec peak)
