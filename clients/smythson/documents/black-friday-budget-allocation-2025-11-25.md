### Budget Reconciliation

- Target Black Friday spend: **£14,316/day**
- Projected BF spend (from allocation): **£11,745/day**
- **Gap:** £2,571/day

1. UK Brand Exact (can go to £2,500/day with ROAS reduction)
2. UK P Max H&S Christmas Gifting (can go to £1,200/day)
3. USA Brand Exact (can go to £2,000/day with ROAS reduction)

| UK Shopping H&S | TBD | **-15%** | Unlock volume | 4,040% ROAS + 44% lost IS = capacity to scale |
| UK Shopping Zombies | TBD | **-15%** | Unlock volume | 1,700% ROAS + 52% lost IS = high lost IS |

| EUR ROEuro Brand AI | TBD | **-15%** | Unlock volume | 10,129% ROAS + 18% lost IS = MASSIVE efficiency |

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Overspending
**Scenario:** Campaigns spend faster than expected, exceed £14,316/day target
**Mitigation:** Daily 9am checks with immediate budget reductions if overspending >10%
**Action:** Reduce budgets on lowest-ROAS campaigns first

### Risk 2: Underspending
**Scenario:** Campaigns don't utilize increased budgets, remain under £12,000/day
**Mitigation:** Evening checks (6pm) with immediate budget increases if underspending >15%
**Action:** Increase budgets on highest-ROAS campaigns with remaining capacity (UK Brand Exact, P Max Christmas Gifting, USA Brand Exact)

### Risk 3: ROAS Collapse
**Scenario:** ROAS-reduced campaigns drop below 300% ROAS
**Mitigation:** Daily ROAS monitoring on all campaigns with reduced targets
**Action:** Immediately revert ROAS target to pre-BF level if drops below 300%

### Risk 4: Forgotten Reversions (Dec 3)
**Scenario:** Forgetting to unpause campaigns or revert ROAS targets on Dec 3
**Mitigation:** Calendar reminders + task in Google Tasks
**Action:** Set 3 reminders: Dec 2 evening, Dec 3 morning, Dec 3 afternoon
