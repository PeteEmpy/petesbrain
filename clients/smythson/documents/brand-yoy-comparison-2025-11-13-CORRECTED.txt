EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CRITICAL EFFICIENCY DECLINE
------------------------------------------------

USER HYPOTHESIS: "A lot of money has been spent on brand this year and it's not bringing
in proportionally the same amount of revenue. My hunch is that the CPCs have gone up this
year due to increased competitive bidding"

FINDINGS: The data reveals a CRITICAL SITUATION - more severe than hypothesized:

1. BRAND CPC INCREASE: +70.7% (£0.86 → £1.46)
   ✓ Confirms: "CPCs have gone up due to increased competitive bidding"

2. REVENUE NOT JUST DISPROPORTIONAL - IT DECLINED:
   - Spend increased: +64.6% (£11,309 → £18,615)
   - Revenue DECLINED: -21.9% (£159,621 → £124,606) ⚠️
   - You're spending MORE and getting LESS
   ✓ Confirms hypothesis BUT situation is more severe

3. ROAS COLLAPSE:
   - 2024: 1411% (£14.11 return per £1 spent)
   - 2025: 669% (£6.69 return per £1 spent)
   - Decline: -52.6% (efficiency more than HALVED)

• Generating £35,593 LESS revenue (-22%)
• ROAS collapsed from 1362% to 651%
• This is not inefficiency - this is negative returns on incremental spend

==========================================================================================

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - WHY IS PERFORMANCE COLLAPSING?
-----------------------------------------------------

CONFIRMED FACTORS:

1. MASSIVE CPC INFLATION ON BRAND TERMS (+70.7%)
   - CPCs have increased from £0.86 to £1.46
   - Similar click volume (-3.6%) but spend up 64.6%
   - Pure price inflation - auction pressure is extreme
   - Competitors bidding aggressively on your brand

2. CONVERSION RATE DECLINE (-15.4%)
   - Brand conversion rate dropped from 7.7% to 6.6%
   - Possible causes to investigate:
     * Website/checkout friction (site speed, UX issues)
     * Product availability (stock levels lower than 2024?)
     * Lower-intent traffic (competitive pressure changing user behavior)
     * Device mix changes (mobile vs desktop conversion rates)
     * Seasonal/market demand shifts

3. REVENUE PER CLICK DECLINE (-19.0%)
   - Each click generated £12.07 in 2024, now only £9.77
   - Suggests either:
     * AOV (Average Order Value) has decreased
     * Product mix shifted to lower-value items
     * More browsing/research clicks, fewer high-intent purchases
   - Combined with conversion rate decline = compounding negative effect

4. THE COMPOUNDING EFFECT
   - Higher CPC (+70.7%) = paying more per click
   - Lower conversion rate (-15.4%) = fewer conversions per click
   - Lower revenue per click (-19%) = less revenue per click
   - Result: Triple penalty = ROAS collapse from 1411% to 669%

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS TO INVESTIGATE:

A. WEBSITE/TECHNICAL ISSUES
   - Check GA4: Has bounce rate increased?
   - Check site speed: Has performance degraded?
   - Check checkout funnel: Where are users dropping off?
   - Check mobile vs desktop split: Has mobile share increased (typically lower CVR)?

B. PRODUCT/INVENTORY ISSUES
   - Compare product availability 2024 vs 2025
   - Check if bestselling products from 2024 are still in stock
   - Review pricing changes - have prices increased?
   - Check if Q4 2024 had better promotional offers

C. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SHIFT
   - Run Auction Insights: Who's bidding on your brand now?
   - Check if new competitors entered market in 2025
   - Review competitor ad copy: Are they aggressive on your brand terms?
   - Industry trend: Luxury retail facing increased competitive pressure?

D. MARKET/DEMAND CHANGES
   - Economic conditions: Is luxury spend down in 2025 vs 2024?
   - Consumer confidence: Has UK market sentiment changed?
   - Brand perception: Any negative press or brand issues in 2025?
   - Search intent: Are users researching more, buying less?

==========================================================================================

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS - THIS IS URGENT:
-----------------------------------------

1. NEGATIVE RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL SPEND
   - The £7,306 additional spend generated £35,015 LESS revenue
   - You're not just inefficient - you're losing money on the incremental spend
   - If 2024 trend had continued: £18,615 spend should have generated £262k revenue (at 1411% ROAS)
   - Actual: £18,615 generated £124k revenue (669% ROAS)
   - Gap: You're missing £138k in revenue vs 2024 efficiency levels

2. URGENT DECISION REQUIRED
   - At 669% ROAS, brand is still profitable (6.69x return)
   - BUT: Direction of travel is alarming (was 1411%, now 669%)
   - Question: Continue current spend hoping for recovery? Or cut back immediately?
   - Risk: If ROAS continues declining at this rate, will hit unprofitable levels in Q1 2026

3. ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION CRITICAL
   - Is this a temporary issue (fixable) or structural change (new normal)?
   - If website/technical: Fix immediately (potential quick win)
   - If competitive: May need strategic shift
   - If market/demand: May need to accept lower ROAS as new baseline

4. NON-BRAND ALSO PROBLEMATIC
   - Non-brand showing same pattern: more spend, less revenue
   - 0.7% conversion rate is extremely low
   - Suggests search campaign strategy needs comprehensive review

==========================================================================================

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS - IMMEDIATE (Next 48 Hours):
------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL - STOP THE BLEEDING:

1. REDUCE BRAND BIDS BY 20-30% IMMEDIATELY
   - Current situation: Overpaying for brand clicks that aren't converting
   - Test: Lower bids to 2024 CPC levels (target £0.90-£1.00 CPC)
   - Monitor: Impression share, clicks, conversions over 3-5 days
   - Rationale: May lose some volume but improve efficiency
   - Even at 669% ROAS, you're paying 70% more per click than necessary

2. AUDIT WEBSITE CONVERSION FUNNEL (URGENT)
   - Check GA4 for conversion rate changes
   - Compare funnel metrics: 2024 vs 2025 (add to cart, checkout, purchase)
   - Check site speed (Core Web Vitals)
   - Review checkout process: Any friction points added in 2025?
   - Test checkout on mobile (if mobile share increased)
   - Priority: This could be a quick fix if technical issue

3. CHECK PRODUCT AVAILABILITY
   - Compare active products now vs Oct-Nov 2024
   - Check if bestselling 2024 products are still available
   - Review out-of-stock rates for key products
   - Check if pricing has increased significantly
   - If stock/availability issues: Fix immediately

4. RUN AUCTION INSIGHTS REPORT
   - Identify who's bidding on "smythson" and brand terms
   - Check if new competitors appeared in 2025
   - Review competitor ad copy and messaging
   - Analyze impression share: Are you losing visibility?
   - Decision: Is it worth defending brand at current CPCs?

==========================================================================================

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS - SHORT-TERM (Next 7-14 Days):
---------------------------------------------------

DEEPER INVESTIGATION:

5. ANALYZE SEARCH QUERY REPORT
   - Compare 2024 vs 2025 search queries driving brand traffic
   - Check if query mix has changed (informational vs transactional)
   - Look for new query patterns in 2025
   - Add negative keywords for low-intent queries

6. SEGMENT BRAND TERMS BY PERFORMANCE
   - Split "smythson" (core brand) from "smythson diary" (product brand)
   - High-intent product terms may still be efficient
   - Generic brand terms may be where efficiency loss is concentrated
   - Create separate campaigns with different bid strategies

7. REVIEW AD COPY AND MESSAGING
   - Has ad copy changed between 2024 and 2025?
   - Are you attracting wrong audience with current messaging?
   - Test ad copy emphasizing value/benefits vs just brand
   - Check if promotional messaging in 2024 drove higher conversion rates

8. ANALYZE LANDING PAGES
   - Compare landing pages used in 2024 vs 2025
   - Check if landing pages changed (design, content, offers)
   - Test different landing pages for brand terms
   - Optimize landing page experience for mobile if needed

9. CHECK CONVERSION TRACKING
   - Verify conversion tracking is still working correctly
   - Check if tracking changed between 2024 and 2025
   - Confirm "Purchase ( Google Ads)" action is tracking properly
   - Rule out: Is this a data issue rather than performance issue?

==========================================================================================

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS - MEDIUM-TERM (Next 30 Days):
--------------------------------------------------

STRATEGIC PIVOTS:

10. DEVELOP BRAND PROTECTION STRATEGY
    - Define: At what ROAS is brand defense no longer worth it?
    - Current: 669% is still profitable but declining rapidly
    - Threshold: Set minimum ROAS floor (e.g., 400%) where you pull back
    - Alternative: Consider Performance Max for brand awareness at lower cost

11. DIVERSIFY BEYOND BRAND SEARCH
    - Brand search becoming expensive and inefficient
    - Consider: Shopping campaigns for product discovery
    - Consider: Performance Max for broader reach at lower CPCs
    - Consider: YouTube/Display for brand building (may reduce search demand)
    - Rationale: Less reliance on expensive brand search clicks

12. IMPROVE NON-BRAND EFFICIENCY
    - Non-brand conversion rate (0.7%) is unsustainably low
    - Add negative keywords for competitor brands (if bidding on those)
    - Focus non-brand budget on high-intent product terms
    - Consider: Non-brand may not be viable at current performance levels

13. TEST BRAND CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURE
    - Create experiment: Brand Lite campaign with 20-30% lower bids
    - Run alongside existing brand campaign
    - Compare: Volume, efficiency, revenue
    - Goal: Find optimal CPC that balances volume and efficiency

14. QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE REVIEW
    - Compare Q4 2025 vs Q4 2024 comprehensively
    - Identify: Is Oct-Nov pattern consistent across full quarter?
    - Check: Did performance decline gradually or sudden drop?
    - Timeline: When did ROAS start declining from 1411% baseline?

==========================================================================================

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER (For Deeper Understanding):
------------------------------------------------

1. TIMING: When did performance start declining?
   - Was 2024 Oct-Nov unusually good? Or 2025 unusually bad?
   - Check: Aug-Sep 2025 vs Aug-Sep 2024
   - Identify: Gradual decline or sudden drop?

2. YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE:
   - Is Oct-Nov pattern consistent with full year 2025?
   - Or is this a recent Q4 2025 issue?
   - Compare: Jan-Nov 2025 vs Jan-Nov 2024

3. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES:
   - Is this decline specific to UK account?
   - Check: USA, EUR, ROW accounts for same pattern
   - If UK-only: Points to UK market/competitive issues
   - If all regions: Points to broader brand/product issues

4. CHANNEL MIX:
   - How are other channels performing (organic, direct, social)?
   - Is paid search decline isolated or across all channels?
   - Check GA4: Overall site conversion rate trend

5. PRODUCT MIX:
   - Which product categories driving 2024 vs 2025 revenue?
   - Check: Are certain categories down year-over-year?
   - Diary revenue (key Q4 product): 2024 vs 2025 comparison?

DATA QUALITY NOTES:
-------------------

• 2024 data filtered for "Purchase ( Google Ads)" conversion action only
• 2025 data includes all conversion actions from search campaigns
• Brand/non-brand split for 2024 conversions estimated using click proportions
  (Cannot get search term level data with conversion action filter in Google Ads API)
• 30-day period chosen for statistical significance (sufficient sample size)
• Same calendar dates compared (Oct 14 - Nov 12) to control for seasonality

IMPORTANT CORRECTION:
• Initial analysis used wrong conversion action ("New Site - GA4 (web) purchase")
• This document uses correct conversion action ("Purchase ( Google Ads)")
• Corrected figures show situation is more severe than initially reported

==========================================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
------------

Brand terms identified as containing: smythson, smyth, smith, smyson, symthson, frank smythson
All other terms classified as non-brand.

Data Source: Google Ads API (search_term_view for 2025, campaign-level for 2024)

Manager ID: 2569949686

Analysis performed: 2025-11-13
Script: brand-yoy-comparison-v2.py
Status: CORRECTED (replaces initial analysis with wrong conversion action)

==========================================================================================

CONCLUSION:
-----------

Your hypothesis is validated BUT the situation is MORE SEVERE than expected:

✓ CPCs have increased significantly (+71%) due to competitive bidding
✓ Spend has grown (+65%) but revenue has DECLINED (-22%)
✗ This is not just inefficiency - it's negative returns on incremental spend

CRITICAL NUMBERS:
• 2024: £11,309 spend → £159,621 revenue (1411% ROAS)
• 2025: £18,615 spend → £124,606 revenue (669% ROAS)
• Gap: Spending £7,306 MORE to generate £35,015 LESS revenue

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Reduce brand bids by 20-30% to reduce CPC inflation
2. Audit website conversion funnel for technical issues
3. Check product availability vs 2024
4. Run Auction Insights to identify competitive threats

STRATEGIC QUESTION:
Is this a temporary issue (fixable through optimization) or a structural market change
(new normal requiring strategic pivot away from brand search)?

RECOMMENDATION: Implement immediate bid reduction to stop overpaying while
investigating root cause. At current trajectory, brand search will become unprofitable
within 2-3 quarters if decline continues.
