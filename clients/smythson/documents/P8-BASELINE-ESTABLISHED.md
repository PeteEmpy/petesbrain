## KEY COMPARISONS

### vs. P7 Baseline (421% ROAS)
- P8 ROAS: 446%
- **Improvement: +5.9%** ✅
- Performance is **strengthening** from P7

### vs. Strategy Expectation (540% blended ROAS)
- Expected: 540% (for full month including Black Friday)
- Actual (Days 1-9): 446%
- **Gap: -94 percentage points**
- **This is expected** - seasonal uplift doesn't materialize until Nov 18+

### vs. Q4 2024 Pattern
- Days 1-11 in 2024: All had multipliers 0.41x - 0.78x (below average)
- Current performance at 446% during slow period = **on track**
- Seasonal acceleration expected Nov 18-30 (multipliers 1.2x - 2.7x)

## PROJECTION TO P8 END (Nov 30)

**If current 94.2% performance rate continues:**

| Scenario | Methodology | Projected Revenue | Achievement |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Simple Pace** | £18,640/day × 28 days | £521,934 | 46.6% ❌ |
| **Weighted (94.2%)** | £1,119,436 × 94.2% | £1,054,505 | **94.2%** ✅ |

**Weighted projection is correct** because it accounts for Black Friday week spike (53% of monthly revenue).

**Expected outcome:** £1.05M revenue (94% of £1.119M target)
**Shortfall:** £65k (5.8%)

## TRACKING GOING FORWARD

### Daily Metrics to Monitor
1. **Revenue vs. Expected (weighted)** - from dashboard Column G
2. **ROAS vs. Target ROAS** - from dashboard Column D
3. **Achievement Rate %** - actual / expected revenue

### Weekly Checkpoints

**Week 2 (Nov 12-17 - Days 10-15):**
- Expected: Building momentum, 450-480% ROAS
- Monitor: Is CVR improving week-over-week?
- Checkpoint: Nov 14 (Day 12)

**Week 3 (Nov 18-24 - Days 16-22):**
- Expected: First acceleration, 500-520% ROAS
- Monitor: Nov 18 should show first 1.0x+ multiplier
- Checkpoint: Nov 21 (Day 19)

**Week 4 (Nov 25-30 - Days 23-28):**
- Expected: Black Friday peak, 600-650% ROAS
- Monitor: Nov 23 (BF) and Nov 29 (CM) should spike
- Checkpoint: Nov 25 (Cyber Week start)

### Red Flags to Watch

**Immediate concerns:**
- Achievement rate drops below 85% of weighted expected
- ROAS drops below 400% (below P7 baseline)
- Spend pacing falls below £6,000/day (should be averaging £7,300/day)

**Medium-term concerns:**
- Week 2 doesn't show CVR improvement
- Nov 18-21 doesn't show acceleration (should hit 1.0x+ multipliers)
- Black Friday week performs below 2024 pattern

## BUDGET STATUS

**P8 Total Budget:** £204,604 (£186,051 + £18,553 P7 rollover)
**Days Elapsed:** 9 of 28 days (32.1%)
**Spend So Far:** £37,686
**Budget Used:** 18.4%

**Daily Spend Analysis:**
- Current average: £4,187/day
- Budget allows: £7,307/day (£204,604 / 28 days)
- **Running at 57.3% of available budget** ⚠️

**Question:** Are we under-spending intentionally (saving for peak) or are campaigns hitting limits?

**Action required:** Review budget allocation and confirm pacing strategy is intentional.

## CONVERSION RATE STATUS

**P7 Baseline:** ~4.2% CVR (implied from 421% ROAS)
**P8 Expected:** ~5.4% CVR (implied from 540% ROAS with seasonal uplift)
**P8 Actual (Days 1-9):** ~4.5% CVR (implied from 446% ROAS)

**Current uplift:** +7% vs P7 baseline
**Expected uplift:** +28% by month-end (from Q4 2024 pattern)
**Gap:** Seasonal uplift hasn't fully materialized yet (expected behavior for Days 1-9)

## WHAT TO TELL THE CLIENT

**Current Status (as of Nov 11):**
- ✅ Strong performance: 446% ROAS (up 6% from October baseline)
- ✅ Tracking well: 94% of expected revenue for this point in November
- ⚠️ Slight shortfall: Projecting £1.05M vs £1.12M target (94%)

**What's working:**
- Account is healthy and scaling from P7
- Regional performance is strong (USA and EUR particularly good)
- On track for Q4 seasonal pattern

**What to monitor:**
- Seasonal acceleration mid-month (Nov 18+)
- Black Friday week performance (Nov 22-30)
- Weekly CVR improvements

**Expected outcome:**
- £1.05M revenue at current trajectory (94% of target)
- Potential upside if seasonal uplift matches 2024 pattern
- £65k shortfall manageable given strong ROAS

## CHANGE LOG

| Date | Change | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2025-11-11 | Baseline established | Locked Nov 3-11 figures as authoritative |
| 2025-11-11 | Confirmed 94.2% achievement rate | Dashboard-aligned, not 77.7% miscalculation |
| 2025-11-11 | Set forward tracking methodology | Weekly checkpoints and red flags defined |

## CRITICAL NOTES

1. **Use dashboard figures, not API recalculations** - Dashboard has weighted pacing built in
2. **94.2% achievement is the tracking metric** - Not 77.7% (that was calculation error)
3. **446% ROAS is strong** - Above P7 baseline, appropriate for early November
4. **Seasonal uplift expected Nov 18+** - Don't panic if ROAS doesn't hit 540% until then
5. **£1.05M projection is realistic** - 94% of target, not a failure

**This document is LOCKED. All future P8/P9 analysis must reference these baseline figures.**
