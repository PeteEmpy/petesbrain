STRATEGIC INSIGHTS:

1. BRAND STRENGTH
   - Smythson has exceptionally strong brand recognition
   - Core brand term "smythson" alone drives £8,255 spend / £56,926 revenue (689% ROAS)
   - Product-specific brand terms (diary, notebook) have ROAS of 1700-2000%
   - Brand extensions (sloane street, bond street, london) capture location-based searches

2. NON-BRAND CHALLENGES
   - Non-brand terms generate minimal revenue (£1,595 total)
   - Top non-brand spend goes to competitor terms (Aspinal, Moleskine) with 0% conversion
   - Generic luxury terms (expensive handbags, michael kors, louis vuitton) also convert at 0%
   - Only 1.3% of revenue comes from non-brand despite 4% of spend

3. RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Continue investing in brand terms (strong performance, high ROAS)
   - Consider adding negative keywords for competitor brands (Aspinal, Moleskine, etc.)
   - Review non-brand strategy: £773 spend with £1,595 revenue (206% ROAS) suggests:
     * Either refine targeting to more relevant non-brand terms
     * Or reallocate budget to proven brand terms
   - Opportunity: "christmas gifts for colleagues" is a relevant non-brand term worth testing

4. ACCOUNT STRUCTURE
   - Current setup: Brand and non-brand traffic likely mixed in same campaigns
   - Suggested: Split brand/non-brand into separate campaigns for better control
   - Would enable: Different bidding strategies, budgets, and ROAS targets per type
