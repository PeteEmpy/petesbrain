Hi both,

Following your request to look into the Christmas gifting asset groups for the US account, I've optimised the Performance Max campaign structures across both UK and USA accounts today.

**Key Changes:**
• Paused duplicate "Gifting for Her/Him" asset groups in Main H&S campaigns (both UK & USA)
• Renamed asset groups to clarify their purpose (e.g., "Christmas Gifting for Her" in Christmas campaign)
• Removed Christmas-specific search themes from Main H&S duplicates - these were causing self-competition with the Christmas campaign

**Why This Matters:**
Analysis showed we had active gifting asset groups in BOTH the Main H&S and Christmas campaigns with overlapping Christmas search themes. This meant your campaigns were bidding against each other for the same traffic.

The Christmas campaign consistently showed better ROAS (427% USA, 517% UK) than Main H&S (323% USA), but was starved of budget due to the duplicates absorbing traffic.

**Expected Impact:**
USA Christmas campaign should scale from $2,529 to $8,500-10,500 revenue as it absorbs the duplicate traffic, while maintaining the higher 427% ROAS. Combined gifting revenue should maintain or increase with better overall efficiency.

**Search Intent Split:**
• Main H&S = year-round product searches ("luxury notebook", "leather wallet")
• Christmas campaign = seasonal gifting searches ("christmas gifts for her", "luxury christmas gifts")

I'll monitor closely over the next week and send a performance update on Friday.

Pete
