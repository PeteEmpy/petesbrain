Hi team,

Quick heads up on P8/P9 projections for Smythson - full analysis coming via email shortly.

**The numbers:**
- P7 actual: £114k spend → £480k revenue (421% ROAS) ✅ Smashed targets
- P8/P9 combined budget: £389k available
- Target: £2.38M Google Ads demand
- Projection: £2.10-2.15M (88-90% of target)
- Gap: £230-290k short (10-12%)

**Why the gap:**
Budget constraint, not performance. To hit £2.38M at realistic ROAS (540-555%), we'd need £441k (not £389k).

**Critical caveat:**
This assumes we match Q4 2024's seasonal conversion rate uplift (+26-31% UK, +28-46% USA). If seasonal uplift is weaker, gap gets bigger. We'll validate this in P8 Week 1 (Nov 8).

**Options to close gap:**
A) Add £52.5k budget (split across P8/P9)
B) Reallocate £30-40k from P10 into P9
C) Accept the gap - deliver excellent 540-555% ROAS within constraints

**Account health is excellent** - all 4 regions beat Q4 targets in P7. The constraint is budget vs. target, not capability.

Full breakdown coming via email with regional performance, detailed projections, and weekly monitoring plan.
