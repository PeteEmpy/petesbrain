Budget & ROAS Calculation - Simple Summary

Budgets are allocated based on historical Q4 performance: UK gets 44% (£161K), USA gets 37% (£134K), EUR gets 14% (£51K), and ROW gets 6% (£21K), then divided by days in the period for daily budgets.

ROAS targets are deliberately set much lower than historical actuals (e.g., UK historical 915% vs target 430%) because Q4 conversion rates naturally double during Christmas shopping season. This tells Google's algorithm to chase more volume while the seasonal uplift keeps actual ROAS profitable—essentially betting that strong Christmas demand lets you push volume without sacrificing profitability.

Safety floors (UK: 300%, USA: 180%, EUR: 100%, ROW: 80%) prevent targets from dropping too low if the seasonal uplift doesn't materialize as expected.
