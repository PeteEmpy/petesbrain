========================================================================================================================
BUDGET ALLOCATION STRATEGY FOR P9 2025
========================================================================================================================

Based on Dec 2024 weekly spend distribution, recommended budget weighting:

UK ACCOUNT:
-----------
Week 1 (Dec 1-7):    32% of P9 budget  | Cyber Monday peak + sustained demand
Week 2 (Dec 8-14):   30% of P9 budget  | Mid-month strong performance
Week 3 (Dec 15-21):  25% of P9 budget  | Last order week (declining daily)
Week 4 (Dec 22-28):  10% of P9 budget  | Post-cutoff reduction, Boxing Day spike on 26th
Week 5 (Dec 29-31):   3% of P9 budget  | Year-end minimal spend

DAILY BUDGET GUIDANCE (assuming £186k monthly budget example):
- Dec 1 (Cyber Monday): £9,000-10,000/day (match Black Friday)
- Dec 2-7: £6,000-7,000/day
- Dec 8-14: £6,000-7,000/day (sustained mid-month)
- Dec 15-18: £5,000-6,000/day (declining to last order)
- Dec 19-23: £1,500-2,000/day (post-cutoff minimal)
- Dec 24-25: £800-1,200/day (Christmas dead zone)
- Dec 26 (Boxing Day): £3,000-4,000/day ⬆️ SPIKE
- Dec 27-31: £1,200-1,800/day

USA ACCOUNT:
------------
Week 1 (Dec 1-7):    42% of P9 budget  | Cyber Monday peak (higher % than UK)
Week 2 (Dec 8-14):   32% of P9 budget  | Mid-month strong
Week 3 (Dec 15-21):  15% of P9 budget  | Earlier/sharper last order drop vs UK
Week 4 (Dec 22-28):  8% of P9 budget   | Boxing Day spike on 26th
Week 5 (Dec 29-31):  3% of P9 budget   | Year-end

⚠️ USA shows MUCH sharper decline after mid-month (Week 3 = -53% vs UK's -17%)
  → Earlier last order dates, more aggressive budget reduction needed

EUR ACCOUNT:
------------
Week 1 (Dec 1-7):    40% of P9 budget  | Cyber Monday importance
Week 2 (Dec 8-14):   27% of P9 budget  | Mid-month (lower than UK/USA)
Week 3 (Dec 15-21):  24% of P9 budget  | Last order week
Week 4 (Dec 22-28):  7% of P9 budget   | Boxing Day extraordinary spike (2929% ROAS!)
Week 5 (Dec 29-31):  2% of P9 budget   | Minimal year-end

⚠️ EUR shows EXTREME Boxing Day performance (+2929% ROAS)
  → Allocate disproportionate Week 4 budget to Dec 26 specifically


========================================================================================================================
KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS
========================================================================================================================

1. **CYBER MONDAY = CRITICAL P9 LAUNCH**

   Cyber Monday 2024 was 2nd-best day of December across all accounts:
   - UK: 1375% ROAS (2nd only to early Black Friday momentum)
   - USA: 859% ROAS (strong performance)
   - EUR: 207% ROAS (weaker, but still delivered)

   **2025 Implication:** December 1, 2025 is BOTH Cyber Monday AND first day of P9.

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Treat Dec 1 as extension of Black Friday/Cyber Week momentum
   - DO NOT reduce budgets on Dec 1 from Nov 30 levels
   - Consider this "Cyber Monday Week" as Dec 1-7 (not just Dec 1)
   - Budget allocation: 30-42% of entire P9 budget in Week 1


2. **LAST ORDER DATE CLIFF IS BRUTAL**

   Spend drops dramatically after last order dates:
   - UK: -48% drop (Week 3 → Week 4)
   - USA: -53% drop (Week 2 → Week 3) then another -28% drop
   - EUR: -65% drop (Week 3 → Week 4)

   ROAS behaviour post-cutoff is INCONSISTENT:
   - UK: ROAS improves (+30%) despite lower spend (efficient conversions)
   - USA: ROAS improves massively (+52%) - post-Christmas bargain hunters
   - EUR: ROAS collapses (-57%) in Week 3, then recovers (+319%) in Week 4

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Identify exact 2025 last order dates for each region ASAP
   - Create tiered budget reduction schedule:
     - Standard delivery cutoff → reduce 30-40%
     - Express delivery cutoff → reduce another 40-50%
     - Post-cutoff → maintain minimal presence for Boxing Day spike
   - Monitor ROAS daily Dec 19-23 to identify if efficiency holds


3. **BOXING DAY = MAJOR OPPORTUNITY**

   Boxing Day 2024 showed exceptional spikes vs Christmas week average:
   - UK: +18% spend vs week avg, 1205% ROAS
   - USA: +26% spend vs week avg, 1638% ROAS ⭐
   - EUR: -8% spend vs week avg, but 2929% ROAS ⭐⭐⭐ (extreme efficiency)

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Budget increases specifically for Dec 26, 2025
   - EUR account: Maximise Dec 26 budget (showed 12x normal efficiency)
   - USA account: Strong Boxing Day conversion opportunity
   - UK account: Moderate increase (solid but less dramatic)


4. **POST-CHRISTMAS SUSTAINS** (Dec 27-31)

   Week 5 (Dec 30-31) maintained strong ROAS despite low volume:
   - UK: 619% ROAS
   - USA: 1017% ROAS
   - EUR: 699% ROAS

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Don't go to zero post-Boxing Day
   - Maintain 2-3% of monthly budget for Dec 27-31
   - Year-end sales activity continues (gift card redemptions, sale shopping)


5. **REGIONAL DIFFERENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT**

   USA behaviour differs from UK:
   - Much sharper mid-month decline (earlier last order dates)
   - Stronger Boxing Day/post-Christmas efficiency
   - Week 1 represents 42% of month (vs UK 32%)

   EUR behaviour is volatile:
   - Cyber Monday underperformed (207% ROAS vs 1375% UK)
   - Boxing Day massively overperformed (2929% ROAS)
   - More erratic week-to-week patterns

   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Separate budget allocation strategies per region
   - USA: Front-load even more heavily than UK
   - EUR: Conservative Cyber Monday, aggressive Boxing Day
