Subject: Smythson Custom Label 0 Supplemental Feeds - UK & USA

Hi Lauryn

As requested, I've prepared the custom label 0 supplemental feeds for both UK and USA markets.

Both feeds are identical and contain 117 products across three categories:
- Travel Bags (24 products)
- Card Holders (44 products)
- Jewellery Boxes (49 products)

The feed is available as a Google Sheet:

UK & USA Feed (single feed for both accounts):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nqKuSEDoKIHC0aNrVXicuGxCaHGiYvMhKM7KHtfRzac

This single sheet uses the standard supplemental feed format (id, custom_label_0) and can be uploaded to both UK and USA Google Merchant Center accounts.

Let me know if you need any changes or have questions.

Regards

Peter
