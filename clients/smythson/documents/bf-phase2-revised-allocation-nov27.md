# Black Friday Phase 2 - REVISED Budget Allocation
## Friday 29th - Saturday 30th, 2025

**Created**: 2025-11-27
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Reason for Revision**: P8 budget is £186,051 (not £218,653) - must avoid overspend

---

## Budget Constraint Analysis

### P8 Budget Status (as of Nov 27)
- **Total P8 Budget**: £186,051 (28 days)
- **Spent Nov 3-27**: £143,515 (25 days)
- **Budget Remaining**: £42,536 (3 days left)
- **Days Remaining**: Thu 28th, Fri 29th, Sat 30th

### Original vs Revised Plan

| Plan | Thu 28th | Fri 29th | Sat 30th | Total 3-Day | vs Budget |
|------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Original** | £9,680 | £23,180 | £23,180 | £56,040 | -£13,504 ⚠️ OVERSPEND |
| **REVISED** | £9,680 | £16,428 | £16,428 | £42,536 | £0 ✓ ON BUDGET |

**Reduction needed**: £6,752/day on Fri-Sat (from £23,180 to £16,428)

---

## Phase 1 Performance Review (Nov 26-27)

### Spend Analysis (2 days)
| Account | 2-Day Spend | 2-Day Target | Utilization | ROAS |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------|
| UK | £5,144 | £10,000 | 51.4% | 189% |
| USA | £3,988 | £6,000 | 66.5% | 220% |
| EUR | £1,355 | £2,600 | 52.1% | 546% |
| ROW | £832 | £760 | 109.4% | 257% |
| **TOTAL** | **£11,319** | **£19,360** | **58.5%** | **247%** |

### Key Findings
1. **Phase 1 significantly underspent** (58.5% utilization vs £9,680/day target)
2. **UK/USA ROAS dropped 50-63%** from baseline (concerning)
3. **EUR/ROW maintained strong ROAS** (546% and 257%)
4. **Only £5,660/day actually spent** vs £9,680 target

### Strategic Implication
Original Phase 2 plan assumed campaigns would fully utilize Phase 1 budgets. Reality: campaigns are NOT spending at expected rates. Therefore, aggressive Phase 2 increases (£23k/day) would likely result in continued underspend OR force inefficient spend.

**Decision**: Scale Phase 2 to £16,428/day - still an ambitious increase, but achievable given capacity.

---

## REVISED Phase 2 Allocation (Fri 29th - Sat 30th)

### Allocation Principle
Focus on **EUR and ROW accounts** which maintained strong ROAS in Phase 1, while being conservative with UK/USA which showed ROAS degradation.

### Budget Distribution

| Region | Phase 1 Actual | Phase 2 Daily | Change | % of Total |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|------------|
| **UK** | £2,572/day | £7,200/day | +£4,628 | 43.8% |
| **USA** | £1,994/day | £5,500/day | +£3,506 | 33.5% |
| **EUR** | £678/day | £2,700/day | +£2,022 | 16.4% |
| **ROW** | £416/day | £1,028/day | +£612 | 6.3% |
| **TOTAL** | **£5,660/day** | **£16,428/day** | **+£10,768** | **100%** |

**Total 2-day Phase 2 spend**: £32,856 (Fri + Sat)

---

## UK Account - Phase 2 Allocation (£7,200/day)

**Strategy**: Conservative increases given 189% ROAS in Phase 1 (down from 515% baseline). Focus on highest-ROAS campaigns only.

| Campaign | Phase 1 Budget | Phase 2 Budget | Change | Justification |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|---------------|
| Brand Exact | £2,000 | £3,000 | +£1,000 | Highest ROAS (7861%), reduce target -15% |
| P Max H&S Christmas Gifting | £900 | £1,500 | +£600 | 6652% ROAS, only 48% utilization |
| P Max H&S | £700 | £1,000 | +£300 | 6496% ROAS, capacity available |
| P Max Briefcases | £550 | £800 | +£250 | 7254% ROAS, 49% utilization |
| Shopping H&S | £700 | £900 | +£200 | 4040% ROAS, reduce target -10% |
| All Other Campaigns | £2,020 | £2,000 | -£20 | Maintain or slight reduction |
| **UK TOTAL** | **£6,870** | **£7,200** | **+£330** | **Conservative +4.8%** |

**Note**: UK only gets +£330/day increase (not +£850 as in original plan) due to Phase 1 ROAS concerns.

---

## USA Account - Phase 2 Allocation (£5,500/day)

**Strategy**: Moderate increases. USA showed 220% ROAS in Phase 1 (down from 441% baseline). Focus on Brand campaigns which held up best.

| Campaign | Phase 1 Budget | Phase 2 Budget | Change | Justification |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|---------------|
| Brand Exact | £1,600 | £2,200 | +£600 | 5736% ROAS, reduce target -15% |
| Brand Stationery | £200 | £400 | +£200 | 20324% ROAS (exceptional) |
| P Max H&S | £1,000 | £1,400 | +£400 | 3896% ROAS, 67% utilization |
| P Max H&S Christmas Gifting | £900 | £1,200 | +£300 | 3673% ROAS, 44% utilization |
| All Other Campaigns | £760 | £300 | -£460 | Cut lower performers |
| **USA TOTAL** | **£4,460** | **£5,500** | **+£1,040** | **+23.3%** |

---

## EUR Account - Phase 2 Allocation (£2,700/day)

**Strategy**: AGGRESSIVE increases. EUR showed 546% ROAS in Phase 1 (down from 774% but still excellent). Exceptional ROAS justifies scaling.

| Campaign | Phase 1 Budget | Phase 2 Budget | Change | Justification |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|---------------|
| DE Search Brand AI | £50 | £200 | +£150 | 10219% ROAS, reduce target -20% |
| ROEuro Search Brand AI | £75 | £200 | +£125 | 10129% ROAS, reduce target -15% |
| DE Shopping | £20 | £100 | +£80 | 9157% ROAS, reduce target -20% |
| RONot Search Brand AI | £35 | £80 | +£45 | 5726% ROAS, reduce target -15% |
| IT Search Brand AI | £11 | £50 | +£39 | 25132% ROAS (MASSIVE) |
| FR Search Brand AI | £13 | £50 | +£37 | 2668% ROAS, overspending but profitable |
| DE P Max Christmas Gifting | £15 | £50 | +£35 | 4349% ROAS, 47% lost IS |
| FR P Max Christmas Gifting | £12 | £40 | +£28 | 12355% ROAS, reduce target -15% |
| All Other Campaigns | £99 | £1,530 | +£1,431 | Proportional increases across remaining campaigns |
| **EUR TOTAL** | **£330** | **£2,700** | **+£2,370** | **+718% - MASSIVE SCALE** |

**Note**: EUR gets largest % increase because ROAS held strong in Phase 1. This is the growth opportunity.

---

## ROW Account - Phase 2 Allocation (£1,028/day)

**Strategy**: Significant increase. ROW showed 257% ROAS in Phase 1 (down from 340% baseline but still profitable). Currently overspending most budgets - add capacity.

| Campaign | Phase 1 Budget | Phase 2 Budget | Change | Justification |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|---------------|
| Search Brand AI | £67 | £300 | +£233 | 3249% ROAS, 386% utilization (massive demand) |
| AUS Search Brand AI | £9 | £200 | +£191 | 5765% ROAS, 939% utilization (huge demand) |
| P Max Diaries | £9 | £100 | +£91 | 3653% ROAS, 246% utilization |
| Search Brand Diaries | £8 | £100 | +£92 | 6813% ROAS, 294% utilization |
| All Other Campaigns | £12 | £328 | +£316 | Proportional increases |
| **ROW TOTAL** | **£105** | **£1,028** | **+£923** | **+879% - HUGE SCALE** |

**Rationale**: ROW campaigns are ALL overspending their current budgets (246%-939% utilization) with strong ROAS. Clear demand signal = scale aggressively.

---

## Thursday 28th - Phase 1 Final Day (£9,680)

**NO CHANGES** - Keep Phase 1 budgets as-is for Thursday:
- UK: £6,850/day (Phase 1 budget)
- USA: £4,460/day (Phase 1 budget)
- EUR: £330/day (Phase 1 budget)
- ROW: £105/day (Phase 1 budget)

**Rationale**: Thursday is final Phase 1 monitoring day to assess readiness for Phase 2. Use this data to make last-minute adjustments before Friday deployment.

## Risk Assessment - Revised Plan

### Risk: Still Underspending
**Probability**: Medium-High (Phase 1 only hit 58.5% of target)
**Impact**: Budget left on table, miss Black Friday opportunity
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor hourly on Friday 9am-2pm
- If spend <£10k by 12pm Friday, increase EUR/ROW budgets further
- EUR can go to £3,500/day if needed
- ROW can go to £1,500/day if needed

### Risk: ROAS Continues to Decline
**Probability**: Medium (UK/USA already down 50-63%)
**Impact**: Spend money inefficiently, hurt overall P8 ROAS
**Mitigation**:
- Current P8 blended ROAS is 590% (vs 512% target) - massive buffer
- Even if Friday/Saturday drop to 300% ROAS, overall P8 would still hit ~540%
- Set hard floor: If any account drops below 200% ROAS, pause increases immediately

### Risk: Overspending Budget
**Probability**: Low (designed to hit £186,051 exactly)
**Impact**: Eat into P9 budget
**Mitigation**:
- This allocation totals £42,536 over 3 days = exactly on budget
- If overspending detected, cut lowest-ROAS campaigns first
- Daily monitoring prevents significant overspend

---

## Success Criteria

### Budget Metrics (3 days)
- **Thu 28th**: £8,000-£10,000 (Phase 1 final day)

- **UK/USA ROAS**: >250% (allowing for degradation)

### P8 Final Results
- **Total P8 Spend**: £184,000-£186,051 (99-100% budget utilization)
- **Total P8 Revenue**: £950,000-£1,050,000 (target: £952,583)
- **P8 Blended ROAS**: >510% (meeting target)
