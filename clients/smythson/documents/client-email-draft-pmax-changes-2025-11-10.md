# Draft Email to Client: PMAX Campaign Structure Optimization

**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Subject:** Performance Max Campaign Structure Updates - UK & USA Accounts
**To:** Smythson Client Team

---

## Summary

I've made strategic changes to your Performance Max campaign structures across both UK and USA accounts to eliminate duplicate asset groups and improve campaign efficiency. These changes will help maximize performance during the crucial Christmas gifting period.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Main H&S Campaign Updates

**Both UK and USA accounts:**
- **Paused** "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" asset groups in the Main H&S campaign
- **Renamed** "Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting" to "Heroes & Sidekicks" (returning to its original generic name)

### 2. Christmas Gifting Campaign Updates

**Both UK and USA accounts:**
- **Renamed** asset groups to clearly indicate Christmas focus:
  - "Gifting for Her" → "Christmas Gifting for Her"
  - "Gifting for Him" → "Christmas Gifting for Him"
  - "Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting" → "Heroes & Sidekicks - Christmas Gifting"

### 3. Search Theme Optimization (Critical Change)

**Christmas Gifting Campaign:**
- Search themes have been updated and optimized for Christmas-specific intent
- Each asset group now has 49-50 search themes (maximum allowed) focused on seasonal gifting
- Examples include: "christmas luxury leather gifts", "luxury christmas gifts for her/him", "luxury leather christmas gifts for women/men"

**Main H&S Campaign:**
- **Removed** Christmas-specific search themes from paused "Gifting for Her/Him" asset groups
- These search themes were duplicates that were causing self-competition
- The generic "Heroes & Sidekicks" asset group retains broad year-round gifting themes but NOT Christmas-specific language

---

## Why These Changes Were Necessary

### The Duplication Problem

**Before the changes:**
- Both accounts had active "Gifting for Her/Him" asset groups in BOTH the Main H&S campaign AND the Christmas Gifting campaign
- These asset groups contained overlapping Christmas-specific search themes
- This created self-competition where your campaigns were bidding against each other for the same search traffic

**Performance data showing the issue (Last 30 days):**

**UK:**
- Main H&S Campaign gifting revenue: £6,131
- Christmas Campaign revenue: £5,123 @ 5.17x ROAS
- Issue: Less severe in UK, but duplicate structure present

**USA:**
- Main H&S Campaign gifting revenue: $15,190 (including $6,087 from duplicate asset groups)
- Christmas Campaign revenue: $2,529 @ 4.27x ROAS
- Issue: Christmas campaign was significantly underperforming due to budget being split across duplicates

**Key finding:** The Christmas campaign consistently showed better ROAS (4.27x USA, 5.17x UK) compared to Main H&S (3.23x USA), but was starved of budget due to duplicate asset groups in the Main campaign absorbing the traffic.

## Strategic Rationale: Splitting Search Intent

### How This Now Works

**Main H&S Campaign:**
- **Purpose:** Year-round product discovery and generic gifting
- **Search themes:** Product-focused (notebooks, card holders, travel bags, stationery, etc.) + generic gifting themes
- **Search intent captured:** "luxury notebooks", "leather card holder", "luxury gifts for her" (generic, year-round)
- **Landing pages:** Product category pages

**Christmas Gifting Campaign:**
- **Purpose:** Seasonal Christmas gifting (October-December)
- **Search themes:** Christmas-specific gifting themes with clear seasonal intent
- **Search intent captured:** "christmas gifts for her", "luxury christmas gifts", "christmas stocking fillers luxury"
- **Landing pages:** Dedicated gifting pages (/gifts/gifts-for-her, /gifts/gifts-for-him, /christmas.html)

**The key difference:** Search intent is now cleanly separated. Someone searching "leather wallet" will see Main H&S, while someone searching "christmas gift leather wallet" will see Christmas campaign.

## Expected Impact

### Positive Outcomes

**1. Elimination of Self-Competition**
- Your campaigns will no longer bid against each other for the same search queries
- Budget efficiency improves as each campaign focuses on distinct search intent

**2. Christmas Campaign Should Scale Up**
- USA Christmas campaign previously had only $2,529 revenue (last 30 days)
- With duplicates removed, we expect this to increase by $6,000-8,000
- Christmas campaign has proven 32% higher ROAS (4.27x vs 3.23x) - more traffic should flow here

**3. Clearer Campaign Structure**
- UK and USA accounts now have identical structures
- Easier to manage, optimize, and compare performance across regions
- Clear separation between year-round and seasonal campaigns

### Potential Short-Term Adjustments

**Week 1-2 Monitoring (Nov 11-24):**
- Christmas campaign spending may increase as it absorbs previously split traffic
- Total gifting revenue should maintain or increase
- Overall ROAS should improve (more traffic in higher-performing campaign)

**If needed:**
- We can adjust Christmas campaign budgets to accommodate increased demand
- We can re-enable one duplicate asset group as backup if Christmas campaign underperforms (unlikely based on data)

## Performance Expectations

### USA Account (Most Impact)

**Before:**
- Main H&S: $15,190 revenue @ 3.23x ROAS
- Christmas: $2,529 revenue @ 4.27x ROAS
- **Total Gifting: $17,719**

**Expected After:**
- Main H&S: ~$9,100 revenue @ 3.23x ROAS (loss of duplicate asset groups)
- Christmas: **$8,500-10,500 revenue @ 4.27x ROAS** (absorbs duplicate traffic)
- **Total Gifting: $17,600-19,600** (maintained or increased with better ROAS)

### UK Account (Minor Impact)

**Before:**
- Main H&S: £6,131 revenue
- Christmas: £5,123 revenue @ 5.17x ROAS
- **Total Gifting: £11,253**

**Expected After:**
- Minimal change (UK duplicates weren't driving significant traffic)
- Christmas campaign may see slight increase in volume
- Overall structure now matches USA for consistency

## Next Steps & Monitoring

### This Week (Nov 11-17)

I'll be monitoring:
1. **Christmas campaign budget pacing** - ensuring it can scale up to absorb the freed-up traffic
2. **Impression share** - confirming we're not losing any search visibility
3. **ROAS performance** - ensuring Christmas campaign maintains its 4.27x baseline

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Christmas Campaign:**
- Revenue increase from baseline ($2,529 USA, £5,123 UK)
- ROAS maintenance at 4.27x USA, 5.17x UK
- Impression share growth

**Combined Performance:**
- Total gifting revenue should maintain or increase
- Overall ROAS should improve (more traffic in higher ROAS campaign)

### Rollback Plan

If Christmas campaign underperforms in Week 1:
- Re-enable one duplicate asset group in Main H&S as backup
- Adjust Christmas campaign budgets

Based on performance data, this is unlikely - the Christmas campaign has consistently outperformed on ROAS.

## Additional Optimization Opportunities

During this analysis, I also identified that:

1. **No product group filters are currently configured** on any asset groups
   - All products in your Merchant Center feed are eligible for all asset groups
   - Recommendation: Add custom label filters to ensure "Card Holders" asset group only shows card holders, etc.
   - This would make asset groups more targeted and prevent irrelevant products showing for specific search themes

2. **Search themes are extensively configured** (49-50 per asset group)
   - This is excellent and gives Google strong signals
   - All active asset groups have maximum search theme coverage

I can implement product group filters if you'd like to further refine the targeting.

## Summary

**What we've achieved:**
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate gifting asset groups across both UK and USA accounts
- ✅ Clear separation of search intent: year-round vs. seasonal Christmas gifting
- ✅ Aligned UK and USA campaign structures for consistency
- ✅ Positioned higher-ROAS Christmas campaign to capture seasonal traffic
- ✅ Removed self-competition between campaigns

**Expected outcome:**
- Maintained or increased total gifting revenue
- Improved overall ROAS through better traffic allocation
- Cleaner, more efficient campaign structure for Q4

I'll send you a performance update on Friday (Nov 15) with the first week's results.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like me to adjust any of these changes.
