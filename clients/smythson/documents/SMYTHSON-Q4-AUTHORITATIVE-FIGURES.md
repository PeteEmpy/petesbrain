## BUDGET & PERFORMANCE REALITY - UPDATED Nov 17

**Critical Context - Three Compounding Issues:**
1. **No P7 carryforward:** P8 budget £186k (not £204k) - £18.5k less than expected
2. **Lower P7 baseline:** 318% ROAS (not 421%) - 24% below previous understanding
3. **Christmas delivery cutoff:** December limited to 21 days of spend (not 31 days)

**The Math:**
- P7 baseline: 318% ROAS (£479,840 revenue from £151,072 spend)
- Required P8/P9 ROAS: **512%** (61% improvement needed)
- Effective Q4 budget: £459,721 (P7: £151k + P8: £186k + P9: £123k effective)
- Realistic Q4 revenue: **£2,059,578** at 512% blended ROAS

**Target Gap Analysis:**
- Client target: £2,380,000
- Realistic projection: £2,059,578
- **Shortfall: £320,422 (13.5%)**

**Why Target is Unrealistic:**
- Requires 518% blended ROAS to hit £2.38M with available budget
- That's **63% above P7 baseline** of 318%
- Would need exceptional Black Friday/Christmas performance sustained throughout both months

**Revised Expectation:**
- **Achievable target:** £2,060k (87% of client goal)
- **Stretch target:** £2,150k with exceptional seasonal uplift
- **Client target (£2.38M):** Not achievable with current budget and realistic ROAS
