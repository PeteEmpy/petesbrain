Hi Lauren,

Quick update on the UK conversion rate drop:

The decline is coming from Performance Max campaigns, not Brand (which remains stable at 6-8% CVR):

- P Max H&S Briefcases: 3.43% → 0.48% (down 86%)
- P Max H&S Christmas Gifting: 1.87% → 0.75% (down 60%)
- Generic AI campaign: 6.27% → 0.36% (down 94%)

Important context: Several of these campaigns have new asset groups that are still in learning. Learning periods typically take 2-4 weeks for Smart Bidding to optimize, and performance is often volatile during this phase.

The current drops are likely temporary and should improve over the next 2-3 weeks as the campaigns complete their learning phase and optimize for quality conversions.

PMax drives 36% of traffic, so this is skewing the overall account numbers, but Brand campaigns continue to perform well.
