## If Things Go Wrong

**Scenario 1: ROAS drops way below target**
```
You: "UK ROAS dropped to 3.2 after the reduction - what should I do?"

Claude: [Analyzes data]
        - Expected: 3.8-4.0
        - Actual: 3.2 (-16% below target)
        - Revenue: Did it increase?

        If revenue increased: Acceptable trade-off, monitor closely
        If revenue flat/down: Recommend reverting ROAS to 4.0
```

**Scenario 2: Budget overspending**
```
You: "We're at 25% of Q4 budget already and it's only Nov 15"

Claude: [Checks pacing]
        - Should be at ~12% by Nov 15
        - Overspending by 13%
        - Recommendation: Reduce daily budgets across regions
        - OR: Accept overspend if revenue is strong
```

**Scenario 3: Underperforming region**
```
You: "EUR ROAS is only 0.8, way below 1.5 target"

Claude: [Analyzes EUR]
        - Target: 1.5, Actual: 0.8 (-47%)
        - Recommendation: Pause EUR or reduce budget
        - Reallocate to better-performing UK/USA
```

**You make the decision. Claude provides analysis and recommendations.**
