## Strategic Insights

### Account Targeting Strategy
1. **UK & USA accounts**: Single-country focus, tightly controlled
2. **EUR account**: Multi-country but heavily Germany-focused (78% of impressions)
3. **ROW account**: Broad global reach but Singapore/Australia-dominant (74% of impressions)

### Budget Allocation Matches Market Size
- UK (44% budget) → 4.5M impressions (largest volume)
- USA (36% budget) → 5.9M impressions (highest reach)
- EUR (14% budget) → 1.2M impressions (concentrated in Germany)
- ROW (6% budget) → 140K impressions (exploratory markets)

### Geographic Concentration
- **UK**: 100% United Kingdom
- **USA**: 100% United States
- **EUR**: 78% Germany, 18% France/Italy, 4% other 37 countries
- **ROW**: 53% Singapore, 21% Australia, 5% Canada, 21% other 131 countries

### Recommendations
1. **EUR account**: Consider splitting Germany into separate account (like UK/USA model) given 78% concentration
2. **ROW account**: Strong performance in Singapore and Australia suggests potential for dedicated APAC account
3. **Canada** appears in ROW but could potentially join USA account (5% of ROW impressions)
4. **Geographic expansion**: Top-performing ROW markets (Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Israel) could warrant increased budget allocation
