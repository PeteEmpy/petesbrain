## Executive Summary

Based on P7's verified strong performance (421% ROAS) and applying historical Q4 2024 seasonal patterns, we're projecting **£2.10-2.15M in Google Ads demand** for P8+P9 combined, with excellent ROAS of 530-565%.

This puts us **10-12% short of the £2.38M Google Ads target** (approximately £230-290k gap).

**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** This projection assumes we achieve the same seasonal conversion rate increases seen in Q4 2024 (+26-31% UK, +28-46% USA). If seasonal uplift is weaker, the gap will be larger.

| **Total Revenue** | £479,840 | - |
| **Overall ROAS** | **421%** | **+19% above 354% target** ✅ |

### Regional Performance

| Region | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Target ROAS | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| UK | £45,953 | £213,804 | **465%** | 430% | +8% ✅ |
| USA | £43,933 | £176,304 | **401%** | 250% | +60% ✅ |

**Assessment:** Account performing excellently across all regions, significantly exceeding Q4 targets.

**Strategic Note:** P7 was deliberately underspent by £18,553 to roll budget into peak conversion periods (P8/P9).

## P8 & P9 Projections

### Available Budgets

- **P8** (Nov 3-30, 28 days): £186,051 + £18,553 rollover = **£204,604**
- **P9** (Dec 1-28, 28 days): **£183,929**
- **Total P8+P9**: **£388,533**

### Projected Performance (based on 421% P7 baseline + seasonal uplift)

| Period | Budget | Expected ROAS | Projected Demand | Target | Achievement |
|--------|--------|---------------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| **P8** (Nov 3-30) | £204,604 | 530-545% | £1.08-1.12M | £1.12M | 97-99% |
| **P9** (Dec 1-28) | £183,929 | 550-565% | £1.01-1.04M | £1.26M | 80-82% ⚠️ |
| **Combined** | £388,533 | 540-555% | **£2.10-2.15M** | **£2.38M** | **88-90%** ⚠️ |

**Gap:** £230-290k short (10-12% below target)

## Why the Gap Exists

### Budget Constraint, Not Performance Issue

The gap is due to a **budget constraint, not account performance**.

**To hit £2.38M at achievable ROAS levels (540-555%):**
- Required budget: ~£441k
- Available budget: £388.5k
- **Additional budget needed: £52.5k**

**Alternatively:**
- Hitting £2.38M with current £388.5k budget requires **613% average ROAS**
- This is **13% above** what's realistically achievable based on:
  - Historical Q4 2024 peak performance (535-550% blended)
  - Strong P7 baseline (421%)

---

## Critical Assumption: Seasonal Uplift Dependency

### This Projection Relies on Q4 2024 Seasonal Patterns

**Critical assumption:** The £2.10-2.15M projection assumes we achieve the same seasonal conversion rate increases seen in Q4 2024:

- **UK:** +26-31% conversion rate improvement (Oct baseline → Nov/Dec peak)
- **USA:** +28-46% conversion rate improvement (Oct baseline → Nov/Dec peak)
- **Pattern observed:** Consistent year-on-year in Q4 2024 data

### What This Means

✅ **P7 delivered strong 421% ROAS baseline** - account health is excellent

📊 **P8/P9 projections assume conversion rates improve naturally during peak season** (as they did in 2024)

⚠️ **If seasonal uplift doesn't materialise** or is weaker than 2024, the gap to target will be larger

✅ **If seasonal uplift exceeds 2024 levels**, we could get closer to target

**Validation plan:** P8 Week 1 review (Nov 8) will validate whether seasonal pattern is tracking to 2024 levels.

## Options to Close the Gap

### Option A: Add Budget (+£52.5k)

- Increase P8 by £15k and P9 by £37.5k
- **Result:** Hit 95-98% of target at realistic ROAS

### Option B: Reallocate from P10

- P10 has £143k budget with very challenging 712% ROAS target
- Move £30-40k from P10 to P9 (prioritise peak December period)
- **Result:** Hit 93-96% of P8+P9 target
- **Rationale:** December has higher conversion rates than Jan-Feb, so budget has higher ROI in P9

### Option C: Accept the Gap

- Deliver excellent performance within budget constraints (540-555% ROAS)
- **Realistic outcome:** £2.10-2.15M (88-90% of target)
- **Message:** Constraint is budget availability, not account capability

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Account health is excellent:** P7 delivered 421% ROAS, 19% above the 354% target, with all regions exceeding expectations

2. **Seasonal uplift is reliable:** Historical Q4 2024 data shows consistent 25-31% conversion rate improvement during peak season across UK and USA regions

3. **The projected gap is structural:** It's a budget vs. target mismatch, not a performance issue

4. **P8 is close to target:** 97-99% achievement (£7-38k short)

5. **P9 has the larger gap:** 80-82% achievement (£224-251k short) - this is where the budget constraint impacts most

## Historical Q4 2024 Performance Reference

### UK Performance (Q4 2024 - Purchase Action Only)
- October: 4.54% Purchase CR
- November: 5.74% Purchase CR (+26% vs Oct)
- December: 5.95% Purchase CR (+31% vs Oct, peak)
- Q4 Average ROAS: 888% (Purchase only)

### USA Performance (Q4 2024 - Purchase Action Only)
- October: 2.97% Purchase CR
- November: 3.81% Purchase CR (+28% vs Oct)
- December: 4.35% Purchase CR (+46% vs Oct, peak)

**Pattern:** Conversion rates consistently improve 25-30% from October baseline through November/December peak season.

## Next Steps

Based on the £2.38M Google Ads demand target:

1. **Discuss preferred approach** for the projected £230-290k shortfall (Options A, B, or C)

2. **P8 Week 1 review (Nov 8):** Validate whether seasonal conversion rate uplift is tracking to 2024 levels - this will confirm or adjust our P8/P9 projections

3. **Contingency plan:** If P8 Week 1-2 shows weaker seasonal uplift than 2024, what actions should we take?

4. **Weekly tracking:** Monitor performance closely throughout both periods, with particular focus on conversion rate trends vs. Q4 2024 patterns

## Data Quality Notes

**CRITICAL:** All projections use "Purchase" conversion action only.

- Historical Q4 2024 data filtered to Purchase action (no duplicate conversions)
- P7 actual performance verified from Google Ads API (£113,966 spend, £479,840 revenue, 421% ROAS)
- All ROAS and conversion rate projections based on clean Purchase data
- Blended conversion data is unreliable due to historical double-counting issues

**When pulling reports for P8/P9 tracking:**
- Always filter to "Purchase" conversion action
- Ignore blended/all conversions metrics
- This ensures accurate ROAS and conversion rate measurement
