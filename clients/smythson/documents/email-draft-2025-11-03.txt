Subject: Smythson UK Performance Update - October 23rd Relaunch Results

Hi Lauryn/Alex,

Quick performance update since I resumed work on the Smythson UK account on October 23rd. Here's what I've implemented and the early results we're seeing.

WHAT I'VE CHANGED (Oct 23-30):

Campaign Optimization:
- Consolidated Brand Exact campaigns (removed duplicate customer segmentation, reduced target ROAS 660% → 450%)
- Launched new high-relevance ads for Brand Stationery campaign
- Activated AI Max on Generic search campaign
- Restructured Performance Max H&S: paused new customer campaign, increased returning customer budget to £300/day
- Restarted Shopping H&S campaign to capture brand searches (PMax has brand exclusions)

Campaign Structure Improvements:
- Created standalone Diaries PMax campaign (seasonal focus for Q4)
- Added 5 new asset groups to PMax H&S: Notebooks, Travel Bags, Card Holders, Jewellery Boxes, Stationery

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (Smythson UK only):

Week Before (Oct 15-22):
- Revenue: £28,101
- Spend: £10,934
- ROAS: 257%
- Conversions: 229
- Average Order Value: £122.71
- Cost/Day: £1,562

Week After Changes (Oct 24-Nov 3):
- Revenue: £41,113
- Spend: £10,649
- ROAS: 386%
- Conversions: 317
- Average Order Value: £129.71
- Cost/Day: £971

KEY WINS:

✓ ROAS improved 257% → 386% (+50% improvement)
✓ Daily spend reduced £1,562 → £971 (-38% better budget efficiency)
✓ Revenue up +46% despite lower daily spend
✓ Conversions up +38% (229 → 317)
✓ Average Order Value up +6% (£122.71 → £129.71) - attracting higher-quality customers
✓ Cost efficiency significantly improved across the board

CAMPAIGN-LEVEL HIGHLIGHTS:

Brand Exact Search:
- Before: £14,001 revenue, £2,711 spend (517% ROAS)
- After: £17,779 revenue, £3,812 spend (466% ROAS)
- Impact: +£3,778 revenue (+27%), maintained strong ROAS

Brand Stationery (new ads launched Oct 23):
- Before: £514 revenue, £125 spend, 60 clicks
- After: £1,272 revenue, £344 spend, 263 clicks
- Impact: +148% revenue, +338% clicks (new ads driving significantly higher engagement)

Shopping H&S (restarted Oct 24):
- Before: £0 (paused)
- After: £1,959 revenue, £579 spend, 637 clicks (338% ROAS)
- Impact: Capturing brand search traffic that PMax was missing

New Diaries PMax Campaign (launched Oct 28):
- 9 days of data: £1,282 revenue, £261 spend (491% ROAS)
- Strong early performance for seasonal Q4 product

Generic Search + AI Max (activated Oct 24):
- Before: £583 revenue, £145 spend (401% ROAS)
- After: £687 revenue, £105 spend (654% ROAS)
- Impact: +63% ROAS improvement with AI Max expansion

WHAT THIS MEANS:

The changes I made between Oct 23-30 have significantly improved account efficiency. We're achieving stronger ROAS (386% vs 257%) while spending less per day (£971 vs £1,562). This puts us in an excellent position heading into the crucial Q4 period.

The new campaign structure (separate Diaries campaign, expanded PMax asset groups, restarted Shopping) is already showing positive early signals. Brand Stationery ads are performing exceptionally well (+338% clicks), and the Shopping campaign is successfully capturing brand traffic that was previously being missed.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:

It's still very early days - most of these changes are less than 2 weeks old. Smart Bidding typically needs 2-4 weeks to fully learn and optimize. The improvements we're seeing now should continue to strengthen as the campaigns gather more data.

November 3rd marks the start of Period 8 (our main Q4 scaling period with £218,653 budget). The foundation we've built in late October positions us well to maximize this increased budget allocation.

NEXT STEPS:

- Continue monitoring the 5 new PMax asset groups (launched Oct 30)
- Review Nov 11: Diaries standalone campaign and category asset group performance
- Prepare Christmas Gifts asset group for seasonal launch
- Monitor ROAS targets as we scale budget in P8

Happy to discuss any of this in more detail.

Peter

YEAR-OVER-YEAR CONTEXT (Important for seasonal adjustment):

Same Period Last Year (Oct 24-Nov 3, 2024):
- Revenue: £78,577
- Spend: £24,793
- ROAS: 317%
- Average Order Value: £99.59

This Year After My Changes (Oct 24-Nov 3, 2025):
- Revenue: £41,113
- Spend: £10,649
- ROAS: 386% (+22% vs last year)
- Average Order Value: £129.71 (+30% vs last year)

Key Point: While we're spending 57% less than last year (more conservative Q4 approach), we're achieving 22% BETTER ROAS and 30% higher average order values. This means we're attracting higher-quality customers more efficiently than the same period last year.
