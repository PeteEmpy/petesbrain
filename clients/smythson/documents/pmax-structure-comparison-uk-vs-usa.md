## CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES

### 1. **USA Gifting Asset Groups Are Duplicated**

**Problem:**
- **USA main H&S campaign** has "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" asset groups
- **USA Christmas Gifting campaign** ALSO has "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" asset groups
- **UK main H&S campaign** does NOT have these (only in Christmas campaign)

**Impact:**
- USA is running duplicate gifting asset groups across 2 campaigns
- Budget split between duplicate asset groups
- Unclear performance attribution
- Asset groups competing with each other

**Recommendation:**
⚠️ **REMOVE** "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" from USA main H&S campaign (IDs: 6627121210, 6627117558)
- Keep them ONLY in the Christmas Gifting campaign
- This aligns USA with UK structure

---

### 2. **USA Main H&S Has More Asset Groups Than UK**

**Problem:**
- UK main H&S: 9 active asset groups
- USA main H&S: 11 active asset groups (including duplicates above)

**After removing duplicate gifting asset groups:**
- USA would have 9 active asset groups - **ALIGNED WITH UK** ✅

---

### 3. **Men's Briefcases Campaign Structure Differs**

**UK Structure:**
- Separate campaign: "SMY | UK | P Max | H&S - Men's Briefcases" (ENABLED)
  - 2 asset groups: Briefcases + High AOV Bags

**USA Structure:**
- No separate briefcases campaign
- Briefcases asset group exists in "SMY | US | P Max | Bags" campaign

**Recommendation:**
Decision needed:
- **Option A:** Create separate USA "Men's Briefcases" campaign (match UK)
- **Option B:** Keep briefcases in USA Bags campaign (simpler)
- **Current assessment:** This is not a critical deficiency - both approaches can work

---

### 4. **USA-Specific Campaigns (Villains, Zombies)**

**USA has these campaigns that UK doesn't:**
- SMY | US | PMax | Villains (PAUSED)
- SMY | US | PMax | Zombies (ENABLED)

**Assessment:**
- These appear to be USA-specific strategic campaigns
- Not necessarily a "deficiency" - may be intentional for USA market
- Need clarification on purpose

**Question for you:** What are "Villains" and "Zombies" campaigns? Should UK have equivalents?

---

### 5. **Legacy Campaign Clutter**

Both accounts have multiple PAUSED campaigns that create management complexity:

**UK Paused Campaigns (6):**
- SMY | UK | P Max | All Customers 300
- SMY | UK | P Max | Bags
- SMY | UK | P Max | H&S - New Customers
- SMY | UK | P Max | H&S 270 21/5
- SMY | UK | P Max | New Customers H&S 230
- UK - shopping - PMax - Higher Priced Products
- UK - shopping - PMax - Seasonal Products
- UK - shopping - Pmax - bags
- UK - shopping - Pmax - diaries
- UK_Performance_Max_Best_Sellers

**USA Paused Campaigns (10):**
- SMY | US | P Max | H&S - New Customers
- SMY | US | PMax | Villains
- SMY | USA | PMax | Competitor Targeting 250
- USA - shopping - PMax - Best Sellers
- USA - shopping - PMax - Seasonal Products
- USA - shopping - Pmax - bags
- USA - shopping - Pmax - bags - ny
- USA - shopping - Pmax - diaries
- USA - shopping - Pmax - diaries - ny
- USA - shopping - Pmax - other - ny
- USA_Performance_Max_Best_Sellers

**Recommendation:**
- Consider archiving old paused campaigns
- Keep only active strategic structure

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Priority 1: Fix USA Duplicate Gifting Asset Groups

**Action:** REMOVE from USA main H&S campaign (SMY | US | P Max | H&S):
- Asset Group: "Gifting for Her" (ID: 6627121210) - **REMOVE**
- Asset Group: "Gifting for Him" (ID: 6627117558) - **REMOVE**

**Rationale:**
- These are duplicates of asset groups in Christmas Gifting campaign
- UK doesn't have these in main H&S - USA shouldn't either
- Keeps gifting focused in dedicated Christmas campaign

**Timeline:** Immediate (before Q4 peak)

---

### Priority 2: Align Active Asset Group Count

After removing duplicate gifting asset groups:

**UK Main H&S:** 9 active asset groups
**USA Main H&S:** 9 active asset groups ✅ ALIGNED

Both will have:
- Card Holders
- Competitors H&S
- Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting
- Jewellery Boxes and Rolls
- Leopard Collection
- Notebooks
- Remarketing
- Stationery
- Travel Bags

---

### Priority 3: Document Strategic Differences

**Campaigns that differ between UK/USA:**
1. **Villains/Zombies (USA only)** - Document purpose
2. **Men's Briefcases (UK separate, USA in Bags)** - Decide if this matters
3. **NY-specific campaigns (USA paused)** - Keep or remove?

---

## SUMMARY: DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED

### ❌ Critical Issues:

1. **USA main H&S has duplicate gifting asset groups** that UK doesn't have
   - Remove "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" from USA main H&S
   - Keep only in Christmas Gifting campaign

### ⚠️ Moderate Issues:

2. **Briefcases campaign structure differs** (UK: separate campaign, USA: in Bags campaign)
   - Not critical, but inconsistent
   - Decide on preferred approach

3. **USA has Villains/Zombies campaigns** that UK doesn't have
   - May be intentional - need clarification

4. **Legacy paused campaigns create clutter**
   - Consider cleanup for both accounts

### ✅ What's Working:

- Christmas Gifting campaigns ARE properly aligned
- Both have similar core asset group categories
- Diaries separated into standalone campaigns (both accounts)

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Remove duplicate gifting asset groups from USA main H&S** (Priority 1)
2. **Verify asset group performance** before/after removal
3. **Clarify purpose of Villains/Zombies campaigns** (USA-specific strategy?)
4. **Decide on briefcases campaign structure** (separate vs combined)
5. **Clean up legacy paused campaigns** (both accounts)

---

**Your specific confusion about "gifting campaigns and asset groups related to gifting":**

The issue is that **USA has gifting asset groups in TWO places**:
- In the Christmas Gifting campaign (correct)
- In the main H&S campaign (should be removed)

**UK has gifting asset groups in ONE place**:
- Only in the Christmas Gifting campaign (correct)

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate gifting asset groups from USA main H&S campaign.
