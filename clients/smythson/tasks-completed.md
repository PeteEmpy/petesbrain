## Smythson: PMAX Christmas Campaign Structure Optimization
**Completed:** 2025-11-10
**Source:** Client request - investigate US Christmas gifting asset groups

**Changes Made:**
- Paused duplicate "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" asset groups in Main H&S campaigns (UK & USA)
- Renamed "Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting" back to "Heroes & Sidekicks" in Main H&S
- Renamed all Christmas campaign asset groups to clearly indicate "Christmas" focus
- Removed Christmas-specific search themes from Main H&S duplicates (eliminating self-competition)
- Christmas campaign now exclusively owns all Christmas-specific search themes

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Analysis showed active gifting asset groups in BOTH Main H&S and Christmas campaigns with overlapping Christmas search themes
- Created self-competition where campaigns bid against each other
- Christmas campaign had better ROAS (427% USA, 517% UK) vs Main H&S (323% USA) but was starved of budget
- USA Christmas campaign expected to scale from $2,529 to $8,500-10,500 revenue

**Follow-up Required:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Performance update due Friday 2025-11-15**
- Monitor: Christmas campaign budget pacing, impression share, ROAS maintenance
- Key metrics: Combined gifting revenue should maintain or increase

**Documentation:**
- Email draft: `/clients/smythson/documents/email-draft-2025-11-10-pmax-structure-optimisation.html`
- Teams message: `/clients/smythson/documents/teams-message-2025-11-10-pmax-structure-optimisation.html`
- Analysis: `/clients/smythson/documents/search-themes-product-groups-analysis-2025-11-10.md`

## Smythson: Black Friday Asset Text Removal + Italian Christmas Search Themes
**Completed:** 2025-11-20 17:30
**Source:** Client request (Lauren) - Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**What Changed:**

**1. Black Friday Text Removal (All Accounts)**
- **Scope:** All 4 Google Ads accounts (UK, USA, EUR, ROW)
- **Action:** All "Black Friday is Here" text blanked out in:
  - Performance Max asset groups
  - Responsive Search Ads (RSAs)
- **Text handling:** Left blank - no replacement copy added
- **Timing:** Mid-Black Friday period (Nov 20), ahead of planned Dec 2 full reversion

**2. Italian Christmas PMAX Search Themes (EUR Account)**
- **Campaign:** Italian Christmas gift PMAX
- **Search themes added:**
  - "Christmas for him"
  - "Christmas for her"
  - Generic Christmas themes
- **Purpose:** Focus on gift-giving intent for Italian market

**Strategic Context:**

**Client Expectation (Lauren):**
- CTR to increase by removing blanket Black Friday messaging saturation
- Reduce message fatigue from excessive BF copy across all assets

**Implementation Context:**
- Executed ahead of Dec 2 full asset reversion deadline
- Time constraints prevented writing replacement copy - text fields left blank
- Part of broader asset management strategy post-Nov 18 BF launch

**Account Manager Notes:**
- Strategic disagreement with approach (blanking vs replacing with Christmas messaging)
- Concern that "damage already done" from Nov 18 Black Friday asset launch issues
- Risk: Blank text fields may reduce ad relevance/quality scores vs replacement copy

**Review Plan:**
- Monitor CTR impact over next few days vs Black Friday messaging baseline
- Track quality scores and ad strength metrics
- Full performance review as part of Dec 2 asset reversion analysis

**Success Criteria (Client):**
- CTR improvement from reduced message fatigue
- Maintain or improve conversion performance
- Smooth transition toward Christmas messaging phase

**Files/References:**
- Reversion spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wwILYgddS946SAlvD5yjLjbLMRFQagsi0-5XFJmvC1g/edit?gid=0#gid=0

**Priority:** P0
**Time Estimate:** 120 mins
**Due Date:** 2025-11-27

**RUN: Tuesday 26th Nov, 8am-12pm (hourly checks)**
**PURPOSE:** Verify campaigns are spending increased budgets and ROAS isn't collapsing

**Hourly checks (9am, 10am, 11am, 12pm):**

1. **Check actual spend vs target:**
```python
# Query each account for today's spend
mcp__google-ads__run_gaql(
    customer_id='[account_id]',
    manager_id='2569949686',
    query='''
        SELECT 
            campaign.name,
            metrics.cost_micros,
            campaign_budget.amount_micros
        FROM campaign
        WHERE segments.date = '2025-11-26'
    '''
)
```

2. **Expected hourly pacing:**
- 9am: ~£807 spent (8% of £9,680 daily target)
- 10am: ~£1,613 spent (17%)
- 11am: ~£2,420 spent (25%)
- 12pm: ~£3,227 spent (33%)

3. **Check ROAS maintenance:**
```python
# Query revenue alongside spend
SELECT 
    campaign.name,
    metrics.cost_micros,
    metrics.conversions_value
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date = '2025-11-26'
```

**Red flags:**
- Any campaign <50% budget utilization by 12pm
- ROAS dropped >20% vs 7-day baseline (UK 515%, USA 441%, EUR 774%, ROW 340%)
- Total spend <£3,000 by 12pm

**Actions if issues found:**
- Campaigns not spending: Check if Lost IS Budget was too optimistic, may need to reduce budgets
- ROAS collapsed: Pause budget increases, revert to previous levels
- Document any issues for Phase 2 decision making

---

**RECURRING TASK:** This runs daily until further notice. Priority is P0 ONLY on the due date, otherwise P2.

**Implementation:**
```python
mcp__google-ads__update_campaign_status(
    customer_id='[account_id]',
    manager_id='2569949686',
    campaign_id='[campaign_id]',
    status='ENABLED'
)
```

**Also restore budgets to post-BF sustainable levels:**
- Revert Phase 2 increases (Friday levels back to normal December budgets)
- Document new December budget allocation based on BF learnings

**Verification:**
Query all accounts to confirm all campaigns ENABLED:
```python
SELECT campaign.name, campaign.status 
FROM campaign
```

**Why this is critical:**
UK P Max Diaries campaign has strong December seasonality for diary purchases. Missing even one day could cost significant revenue.

## [Smythson] Track Black Friday promotion product performance (757 products)
**Completed:** 2025-12-16 08:20
**Source:** Meeting - 2025-11-19 (manually extracted)

**From Meeting - 2025-11-19**

**Action:** Track performance of the 757 products with Black Friday promotions applied to measure impact.

**Your commitment:** "what I might do, I'm curious as to what effect this has, so what I'll do is I'm going to track the performance of those products over the next week. And see whether it made any difference to their sales volume. That would be an interesting test."

**Hypothesis:** Products with promotions showing in Google Ads should get preferential treatment and higher sales.

**Tracking period:** Week following 19th Nov (through to ~26th Nov)

**Metrics to track:**
- Sales volume (before vs during promotion)
- Click-through rate
- Impression share
- Conversion rate
- Revenue

**Files:**
- Promotion feed: Black Friday Promotions 2025 (supplemental feed)
- 757 products successfully matched with promotion_id
- 627 products failed to match (separate issue)

**Deliverable:** Analysis showing if promotions improved product performance.

**Manual Update (2025-11-25):**
Check how this is going

**Action Required:** Review Black Friday promotion performance data.

## [Smythson] Review Black Friday asset performance (1 week check)
**Completed:** 2025-12-16 08:20
**Source:** Manual Completion

Follow-up from Black Friday assets going live Nov 17. Review ROAS vs 2024, conversion rates, and efficiency to confirm we avoided the learning reset that cost £24k last year. Check all 4 accounts (UK, USA, EUR, ROW). Success: ROAS maintains pre-BF levels, no 35% drop like 2024.

## [Smythson] Revert Black Friday assets + create checklist for smooth execution
**Completed:** 2025-12-16
**Reason:** Task audit - One-time action overdue

Revert all Black Friday assets to standard Christmas/product messaging. Create implementation checklist BEFORE Dec 2 to avoid Nov 18 execution issues (URLs, images, wrong asset groups). Coordinate with Lauryn: images, text, URLs go live simultaneously. Goal: smoother ride than Nov 18 launch.

**Progress Update (Nov 18 meeting):** Lauryn committed to creating checklist and sent through asset reversion spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wwILYgddS946SAlvD5yjLjbLMRFQagsi0-5XFJmvC1g/edit?gid=0#gid=0

**Checklist includes:** PMax (images, text, videos, URLs, sentence case) + Search (RSAs, image assets, sitelinks) across UK/US/EUR/ROW accounts. Work split: Peter (UK, EUR) | Lauryn (US, ROW). All items currently pending execution before Dec 2 deadline.

## [Smythson] Present P9 Budget with P8 Adjustment (if applicable)
**Completed:** 2025-12-16 18:04
**Source:** P8/P9 Budget Decision Process

**RUN: Monday 2nd December**
**PURPOSE:** Present P9 budget allocation with P8 overspend adjustment (if occurred)

**If P8 overspent by ~£10,225:**

**1. Document P8 Final Results:**
- Total P8 spend: £X (vs £186,051 budget)
- Overspend amount: £X
- Total P8 revenue: £X
- Final ROAS: X%
- Justification for overspend (strong Black Friday weekend ROAS)

**2. Calculate P9 Adjusted Budget:**
- Original P9 budget: [Client to confirm]
- P8 overspend deduction: £10,225
- Adjusted P9 budget: Original - £10,225

**3. P9 Phase Allocation (Adjusted):**

**Recommended: Reduce Mid-December Phase (Dec 8-14)**
- This is the "sustain" phase, not peak
- 2024 showed UK ROAS improved in this period (efficiency > volume)
- Least impact on critical dates (Cyber Monday, Boxing Day)

**Phase Budget Breakdown:**
```
Phase 1 (Cyber Week, Dec 1-7): X% of adjusted P9 (no change)
Phase 2 (Mid-Dec, Dec 8-14): X% of adjusted P9 (absorbs £10,225 reduction)
Phase 3 (Last Order, Dec 15-21): X% of adjusted P9 (no change)
Phase 4 (Christmas + Boxing, Dec 22-28): X% of adjusted P9 (no change)
Phase 5 (Year-End, Dec 29-31): X% of adjusted P9 (no change)
```

**4. Present to Client:**
- Email Alex with P9 budget document
- Include P8 final performance summary
- Explain P8 overspend rationale (capitalizing on strong ROAS)
- Show net Q4 budget still on track (just period shift)

**If P8 stayed within budget:**
- Present standard P9 budget allocation
- No adjustment needed
- Proceed with original P9 strategy

## [Smythson] P9 Monday Review - Analyze Dec 5-7 actual spend vs targets
**Completed:** 2025-12-17 14:03
**Source:** P9 Budget-Constrained Strategy (Dec 4)

P9 Monday Review with Budget Lag Analysis Complete

**Key Finding: Budget changes take effect within 24 hours**

**Budget Change Analysis (Dec 4, 2025):**
- Before: £5,300/day average (Dec 2-3)
- After: £2,500/day average (Dec 5-16)
- Response time: 1 day (immediate effect)
- Stabilization: 4 days (clean, no oscillation)

**Budget Lag Insights:**
1. **Pre-spending status matters**: Account was actively spending → faster response
2. **Over-correction is common**: Targeted 48% reduction, achieved 67% reduction
3. **PMax responds fastest**: Automated bidding adapts within 24 hours
4. **Weekend patterns persist**: Day-of-week variations continued after change

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- Review budget changes at 24hr, 72hr, and 7-day marks
- Set budgets 10-15% higher than target (to compensate for over-correction)
- Expect immediate effect on Day 1 for actively spending accounts
- Document pre-change status to predict lag patterns

## [Smythson] Monitor Q4 strategy dashboard actuals vs projections
**Completed:** 2025-12-17 14:06
**Source:** Recurring monitoring task

Q4 Strategy Dashboard Audit Complete - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

**🚨 Dashboard Severely Outdated**

The Q4 dashboard is using targets from Nov 3, 2025 (before P9 budget crisis) and is completely out of sync with current December strategy.

**Key Discrepancies:**
- Dashboard budget: £367k → Actual: £171k (53% overestimated)
- Dashboard period: Q4 (Oct 29-Dec 31) → Actual: P9 (Dec 1-31)
- Dashboard ROAS targets: UK 3.0x → Actual: UK 5.0-8.0x achieved
- Last update: Nov 10 → Current: Dec 17 (44 days lag)

**Impact:**
- False status indicators (showing GREEN when should be RED)
- Misleading weekly reports sent to Alex
- Budget pacing calculations wrong
- No P9 phase tracking

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. ⏸️ Pause dashboard automation (to prevent incorrect data sent to Alex)
2. 🔨 Rebuild dashboard with P9 targets (£171k budget, P9 phases, current ROAS)
3. ✅ Test thoroughly before re-enabling
4. 📧 Notify Alex of correction

**Full Analysis:** /Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain.nosync/clients/smythson/documents/q4-dashboard-update-required-dec17.md

**Priority**: HIGH - Dashboard must be updated before next weekly email to Alex.

## [Smythson] P9 Apply Strategic Pauses - Phase 2 begins (Dec 12)
**Completed:** 2025-12-20 18:32
**Source:** P9 Budget-Constrained Strategy (Dec 4)

**PHASE 2: Strategic Pauses to Control Budget**

**TIMING:** Morning of Dec 12 (after reviewing Dec 11 final data)

**OBJECTIVE:** Reduce daily spend from £6,539 to £3,985 actual (£3,321 SET allowing 20% overspend)

**STRATEGY CONTEXT:**
- Phase 1 (Dec 4-11): Hold current budgets - £52k spend
- Phase 2-5 (Dec 12-31): Strategic pauses - £79k spend
- Total P9: £171k (on budget)
- Expected revenue: £941k realistic, £992k optimistic

**1. IDENTIFY CAMPAIGNS TO PAUSE:**

**Criteria for pausing:**
- ROAS < 400% (Dec 1-11 average)
- Generic/Competitor campaigns (lower intent)
- EUR campaigns (stop entirely or mostly)
- ROW campaigns (already stopping Dec 11)

**Query for analysis:**
```python
mcp__google-ads__run_gaql(
    customer_id='[account_id]',
    manager_id='2569949686',
    query='''
        SELECT
            campaign.id,
            campaign.name,
            campaign.status,
            metrics.cost_micros,
            metrics.conversions_value,
            metrics.conversions,
            campaign_budget.amount_micros
        FROM campaign
        WHERE
            segments.date >= '2025-12-01'
            AND segments.date <= '2025-12-11'
            AND metrics.cost_micros > 0
        ORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC
    '''
)

# Calculate ROAS for each campaign
# ROAS = (conversions_value_micros / cost_micros) * 100
```

**2. CREATE BACKUP:**
- Document current state of all campaigns
- Save to: `/clients/smythson/scripts/backup-dec12-strategic-pauses.txt`

**3. PAUSE CAMPAIGNS (SURGICAL):**

**Priority order:**
1. **EUR account**: Pause most/all campaigns (was £339/day SET, ~£500/day actual)
2. **ROW campaigns**: Confirm all paused (should be stopped Dec 11)
3. **Low ROAS UK/USA**: Pause campaigns with ROAS < 400%
4. **Generic/Competitor**: Pause broad/competitor campaigns

**Target daily spend after pauses:**
- UK: ~£2,500/day actual (focus on brand + high ROAS)
- USA: ~£1,400/day actual (focus on brand + high ROAS)
- EUR: ~£85/day actual (1-2 top performers only)
- ROW: £0/day (fully stopped)
- **Total: ~£3,985/day actual**

**4. VERIFY CHANGES:**
- Query new daily spend capacity
- Confirm paused campaigns are actually paused
- Document which campaigns remain active

**5. UPDATE PROJECTIONS:**
- Recalculate expected P9 total spend
- Update revenue projection based on remaining campaigns
- Update Alex via Teams message

**6. MONITOR DAILY:**
- Dec 12-14: Check actual spend daily
- Adjust if still overspending or underspending
- Prepare for Phase 3 Last Order Week (Dec 15-19)

**REFERENCE:**
- `/clients/smythson/reports/p9-budget-constraint-crisis.txt` (Option 3)
- Monday review decision (will inform specific campaigns to pause)

## [Smythson] P9 Last Order Week Scaling - Phase 3 begins (Dec 15)
**Completed:** 2025-12-20 18:32
**Source:** P9 Budget-Constrained Strategy (Dec 4)

**PHASE 3: Last Order Week Scaling (Dec 15-19)**

**TIMING:** Morning of Dec 15 (review Dec 14 data first)

**CRITICAL PERIOD:** Both UK and USA in final week before last order dates:
- USA last order: Dec 19 (5 days)
- UK last order: Dec 22 (but ramp starts Dec 15)

**OBJECTIVE:** Maximize revenue during peak conversion period while staying on budget

**BUDGET ALLOCATION:**
- Original plan: £10,000/day SET
- Budget-constrained plan: £6,000/day SET (£6,900/day actual with 15% overspend)
- 5 days × £6,900 = £34,500 spend for Phase 3

**1. REVIEW DEC 12-14 PERFORMANCE:**
- Verify strategic pauses working
- Check remaining budget headroom
- Calculate safe scaling amount

**2. IDENTIFY SCALING CANDIDATES:**

**Criteria:**
- High ROAS (>600%) during Dec 12-14
- Brand campaigns (highest intent)
- UK/USA only (EUR stopped, ROW stopped)
- Campaigns that were budget-constrained in Phase 2

**Query:**
```python
mcp__google-ads__run_gaql(
    customer_id='[UK or USA account]',
    manager_id='2569949686',
    query='''
        SELECT
            campaign.id,
            campaign.name,
            campaign.status,
            metrics.cost_micros,
            metrics.conversions_value,
            metrics.impressions,
            metrics.search_impression_share,
            campaign_budget.amount_micros
        FROM campaign
        WHERE
            segments.date >= '2025-12-12'
            AND segments.date <= '2025-12-14'
            AND campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
            AND metrics.cost_micros > 0
        ORDER BY metrics.conversions_value DESC
    '''
)
```

**Look for:**
- Campaigns hitting budget limits (search impression share lost to budget)
- Strong ROAS (>600%)
- Consistent performance

**3. CREATE SCALING PLAN:**

**Target increases:**
- UK: +40% on top 5-8 brand/high ROAS campaigns
- USA: +40% on top 5-8 brand/high ROAS campaigns

**Example:**
- UK Brand exact currently £150/day → Increase to £210/day
- USA Brand broad currently £100/day → Increase to £140/day

**Total daily increase target: ~£1,500-2,000/day**

**4. CREATE BACKUP:**
File: `/clients/smythson/scripts/backup-dec15-last-order-week-scaling.txt`

**5. APPLY BUDGET INCREASES:**
Use `mcp__google-ads__update_campaign_budget()` for each campaign

**6. MONITOR CLOSELY:**
- Dec 15: Check 6pm performance
- Dec 16-19: Daily morning + evening checks
- Watch for overspend vs £6,900/day target
- Be ready to pause if exceeding budget

**7. ALGORITHM WARNING:**
- Smart Bidding may overspend 15-20% during high-opportunity days
- Last Order Week = "high-opportunity days"
- Monitor actual vs SET carefully
- Have pause list ready if overspending

**REVENUE EXPECTATION:**
- Phase 3 spend: £34,500
- At 6.0x ROAS: £207k revenue
- At 5.5x ROAS: £190k revenue (conservative)

**REFERENCE:**
- `/clients/smythson/reports/p9-budget-constraint-crisis.txt` (Phase 3 plan)
- Dec 12-14 performance data

## [Smythson] Investigate UK budget constraints - strong ROAS opportunity
**Completed:** 2025-12-20 18:32
**Source:** Weekly Report 2025-12-16

From weekly report 2025-12-16:

**Issue:** UK spend dropped 26.5% WoW (£23,517 → £17,278) while ROAS improved to 7.13x (well above 5.47x target)

**Opportunity:** Strong ROAS suggests room to increase UK budget

**Action Items:**
1. Query UK campaigns for budget constraints:
   - Check search impression share lost to budget
   - Identify campaigns hitting daily limits
   - Review budget allocation across UK campaigns

2. Calculate opportunity:
   - Potential £5K-£10K additional weekly revenue (per report)
   - Current ROAS 7.13x = high-confidence scaling opportunity

3. Propose budget increase if warranted:
   - Target campaigns with >6.0x ROAS AND budget constraints
   - Conservative 20% increase to test response

**Context:** Q4 day 48 of 62, £172K budget remaining (£12.3K/day available)

From Phase IIb deployment completion (Dec 16):

**Deployment Context:**
- Phase IIb deployed Dec 16, 10:09pm
- 42 campaigns updated across 4 accounts
- Total budget reduced from £16,724/day to £5,599.63/day (-50.3%)
- Post-last-orders period (US/EUR/ROW closed Dec 16)

**Monitoring Requirements (Dec 17, 8am):**

1. **UK Performance** (Budget increased in theory, but corrected from inflated state):
   - Check if UK receiving increased traffic/conversions
   - Current budget: £3,857.18/day (was £7,212.50)
   - Expected ROAS: 600%+

2. **US/EUR/ROW Performance** (Reduced budgets):
   - Verify US/EUR/ROW maintain acceptable ROAS at reduced budgets
   - US: £1,064.88/day (was £2,457)
   - EUR: £482.95/day (was £1,196)
   - ROW: £194.62/day (was £394.50)

3. **Overall Metrics:**
   - Daily spend: Target £5,600/day
   - Expected ROAS: 600% (conservative, post-last-orders)
   - Projected revenue: £33,600/day

4. **Red Flags to Watch:**
   - UK under-delivering (budget constraint issues)
   - US/EUR/ROW ROAS collapse (too aggressive reduction)
   - Total spend significantly under £5,600/day (opportunity cost)

## [Smythson] Review Q4 daily spend targets across regions (14 days remaining)
**Completed:** 2025-12-20 18:32
**Source:** Weekly Report 2025-12-16

From weekly report 2025-12-16:

**Context:**
- 14 days remaining in Q4
- £172,743 budget available
- Target: £12,338/day to fully utilize budget
- Current: ~£37,559/week = £5,366/day (UNDER-paced)

**Action Items:**
1. Calculate optimal daily spend by region:
   - UK: Current £17,278/week (£2,468/day) - ROAS 7.13x
   - USA: Current £12,361/week (£1,766/day) - ROAS 9.55x
   - EUR: Current £5,717/week (£817/day) - ROAS 7.89x
   - ROW: Current £2,203/week (£315/day) - ROAS 4.15x

2. Prioritise budget allocation by ROAS:
   - USA: 9.55x (highest) - increase allocation
   - EUR: 7.89x - maintain/slight increase
   - UK: 7.13x - moderate increase
   - ROW: 4.15x (below target) - consider reducing

3. Set revised daily targets to hit £172K remaining budget while maintaining >5.47x overall ROAS

**Goal:** Maximize Q4 revenue capture over final 14 days

## [Smythson] Review ROW campaign structure - ROAS below target (4.15x vs 5.47x)
**Completed:** 2025-12-20 18:32
**Source:** Weekly Report 2025-12-16

From weekly report 2025-12-16:

**Issue:** ROW ROAS at 4.15x (below Q4 target of 5.47x)

**Performance Trend:**
- This week: 4.15x ROAS
- Last week: 6.44x ROAS
- Drop: -2.29x (-35.5%)
- Spend increased +27.9% WoW (£1,722 → £2,203)

**Action Items:**
1. Analyse ROW campaign structure:
   - Which campaigns are dragging down ROAS?
   - Are there low-performing markets within ROW?
   - Review targeting efficiency (geo, audience, keywords)

2. Query ROW campaigns by performance:
   ```python
   # Get last 14 days ROW campaign data
   # Identify campaigns with ROAS < 4.0x
   # Calculate wasted spend opportunity
   ```

3. Decision: Improve or reallocate?
   - Option A: Pause low-ROAS campaigns, keep only >5.0x performers
