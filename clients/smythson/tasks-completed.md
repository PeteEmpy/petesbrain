## Smythson: PMAX Christmas Campaign Structure Optimization
**Completed:** 2025-11-10
**Source:** Client request - investigate US Christmas gifting asset groups

**Changes Made:**
- Paused duplicate "Gifting for Her" and "Gifting for Him" asset groups in Main H&S campaigns (UK & USA)
- Renamed "Heroes & Sidekicks - Gifting" back to "Heroes & Sidekicks" in Main H&S
- Renamed all Christmas campaign asset groups to clearly indicate "Christmas" focus
- Removed Christmas-specific search themes from Main H&S duplicates (eliminating self-competition)
- Christmas campaign now exclusively owns all Christmas-specific search themes

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Analysis showed active gifting asset groups in BOTH Main H&S and Christmas campaigns with overlapping Christmas search themes
- Created self-competition where campaigns bid against each other
- Christmas campaign had better ROAS (427% USA, 517% UK) vs Main H&S (323% USA) but was starved of budget
- USA Christmas campaign expected to scale from $2,529 to $8,500-10,500 revenue

**Follow-up Required:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Performance update due Friday 2025-11-15**
- Monitor: Christmas campaign budget pacing, impression share, ROAS maintenance
- Key metrics: Combined gifting revenue should maintain or increase

**Documentation:**
- Email draft: `/clients/smythson/documents/email-draft-2025-11-10-pmax-structure-optimisation.html`
- Teams message: `/clients/smythson/documents/teams-message-2025-11-10-pmax-structure-optimisation.html`
- Analysis: `/clients/smythson/documents/search-themes-product-groups-analysis-2025-11-10.md`

## Smythson: Black Friday Asset Text Removal + Italian Christmas Search Themes
**Completed:** 2025-11-20 17:30
**Source:** Client request (Lauren) - Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**What Changed:**

**1. Black Friday Text Removal (All Accounts)**
- **Scope:** All 4 Google Ads accounts (UK, USA, EUR, ROW)
- **Action:** All "Black Friday is Here" text blanked out in:
  - Performance Max asset groups
  - Responsive Search Ads (RSAs)
- **Text handling:** Left blank - no replacement copy added
- **Timing:** Mid-Black Friday period (Nov 20), ahead of planned Dec 2 full reversion

**2. Italian Christmas PMAX Search Themes (EUR Account)**
- **Campaign:** Italian Christmas gift PMAX
- **Search themes added:**
  - "Christmas for him"
  - "Christmas for her"
  - Generic Christmas themes
- **Purpose:** Focus on gift-giving intent for Italian market

**Strategic Context:**

**Client Expectation (Lauren):**
- CTR to increase by removing blanket Black Friday messaging saturation
- Reduce message fatigue from excessive BF copy across all assets

**Implementation Context:**
- Executed ahead of Dec 2 full asset reversion deadline
- Time constraints prevented writing replacement copy - text fields left blank
- Part of broader asset management strategy post-Nov 18 BF launch

**Account Manager Notes:**
- Strategic disagreement with approach (blanking vs replacing with Christmas messaging)
- Concern that "damage already done" from Nov 18 Black Friday asset launch issues
- Risk: Blank text fields may reduce ad relevance/quality scores vs replacement copy

**Review Plan:**
- Monitor CTR impact over next few days vs Black Friday messaging baseline
- Track quality scores and ad strength metrics
- Full performance review as part of Dec 2 asset reversion analysis

**Success Criteria (Client):**
- CTR improvement from reduced message fatigue
- Maintain or improve conversion performance
- Smooth transition toward Christmas messaging phase

**Files/References:**
- Reversion spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wwILYgddS946SAlvD5yjLjbLMRFQagsi0-5XFJmvC1g/edit?gid=0#gid=0
- Related task: "[Smythson] Revert Black Friday assets + create checklist for smooth execution" (Due: Dec 2)

## [Smythson] Daily Black Friday Monitoring (8am-12pm hourly checks)
**Completed:** 2025-11-27
**Priority:** P0
**Time Estimate:** 120 mins
**Due Date:** 2025-11-27

**RUN: Tuesday 26th Nov, 8am-12pm (hourly checks)**
**PURPOSE:** Verify campaigns are spending increased budgets and ROAS isn't collapsing

**Hourly checks (9am, 10am, 11am, 12pm):**

1. **Check actual spend vs target:**
```python
# Query each account for today's spend
mcp__google-ads__run_gaql(
    customer_id='[account_id]',
    manager_id='2569949686',
    query='''
        SELECT 
            campaign.name,
            metrics.cost_micros,
            campaign_budget.amount_micros
        FROM campaign
        WHERE segments.date = '2025-11-26'
    '''
)
```

2. **Expected hourly pacing:**
- 9am: ~£807 spent (8% of £9,680 daily target)
- 10am: ~£1,613 spent (17%)
- 11am: ~£2,420 spent (25%)
- 12pm: ~£3,227 spent (33%)

3. **Check ROAS maintenance:**
```python
# Query revenue alongside spend
SELECT 
    campaign.name,
    metrics.cost_micros,
    metrics.conversions_value
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date = '2025-11-26'
```

**Red flags:**
- Any campaign <50% budget utilization by 12pm
- ROAS dropped >20% vs 7-day baseline (UK 515%, USA 441%, EUR 774%, ROW 340%)
- Total spend <£3,000 by 12pm

**Actions if issues found:**
- Campaigns not spending: Check if Lost IS Budget was too optimistic, may need to reduce budgets
- ROAS collapsed: Pause budget increases, revert to previous levels
- Document any issues for Phase 2 decision making

---

**RECURRING TASK:** This runs daily until further notice. Priority is P0 ONLY on the due date, otherwise P2.

**Completed:** 2025-11-26 (Phase 1 Day 1)
