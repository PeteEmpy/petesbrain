## Implementation Notes

### Cut Logic
- **4.2% ROAS (P Max H&S):** Cut 50% — weakest major performer still substantial
- **0% ROAS (Brand Stationery):** Cut 65% — zero justification for remaining spend
- **4.7% ROAS (Brand Plus):** Cut 50% — well below target, redundant with Brand Exact
- **8.5% ROAS (Men's Briefcases):** Cut 20% — secondary category, modest reduction
- **14.9% ROAS (H&S Christmas):** Cut 5% — decent performer, symbolic cut only

### Increase Logic
- **37.4% ROAS (DE P Max Diaries):** +150% — exceptional performer, nearly double
- **26.2% ROAS (DE Search Brand):** +80% — top tier, already over budget
- **23.2% ROAS (FR P Max Christmas):** +120% — excellent fit, nearly double
- **18.8% ROAS (IT Search Brand):** +50% — running significantly over budget, proven demand
- **15.4% ROAS (P Max Christmas):** +50% — strong performer at capacity
- **4.6% ROAS (ROEuro Search Brand):** +15% — baseline regional support
- **0% ROAS (IT P Max Diaries):** +100% — underfunded, needs volume to prove

### Result
- **Net reallocation:** +£212/day to EUR (or +£203 if accounting for rounding)
- **Aggressive without being reckless:** Based entirely on demonstrated ROAS performance
- **All diaries protected:** UK diaries stay fully funded
- **Competitor protected:** Fully funded
- **Reversible:** Dec 18 morning
