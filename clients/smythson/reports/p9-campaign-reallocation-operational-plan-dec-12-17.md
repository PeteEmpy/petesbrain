# Smythson P9: Campaign-Level Reallocation Plan
## Operational Implementation (Dec 12-17)

**Date:** December 11, 2025
**Period:** 6-day window (Dec 12-17)
**Objective:** Shift £8,556 from UK to EUR (£1,426/day average)
**No campaigns paused** - All remain ENABLED, budgets adjusted only

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Regional Spend (Dec 10):**
- UK: £2,551/day (across 10 campaigns)
- EUR: £641/day (across 16 campaigns)

**Target Reallocation:**
- Reduce UK by approximately £1,426/day (mostly lower-ROAS campaigns)
- Increase EUR by approximately £1,426/day (high-ROAS performers)
- Expected net revenue gain: +£40-45k over 6 days

**Key Constraint:** User noted diaries will accelerate - keep both UK & EUR Diaries campaigns well-funded

## UK Campaigns: Reduction Strategy

### Priority 1: Zero/Low ROAS Campaigns (Reduce Aggressively)

| Campaign | Current Spend | Current ROAS | Recommendation | New Daily Budget | Reduction | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|------|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand Stationery** | £99 | 0% | Reduce 40% | £60/day | -£39 | Zero conversions despite £99 spend - redirect to performers |
| **Search Semi Brand Diaries** | £232 | 4.1% | Reduce 20% | £186/day | -£46 | Low ROAS; diaries accelerating in EUR instead |
| **Search Brand Plus** | £129 | 4.7% | Reduce 30% | £90/day | -£39 | Low ROAS; Brand Exact carries core brand |
| **Search Competitor** | £24 | 10.1% | Reduce 35% | £16/day | -£8 | Niche campaign, low volume |
| **Search Generic** | £12 | 8.0% | Reduce 50% | £6/day | -£6 | Minimal spend/volume |

**Subtotal Priority 1:** -£138/day reduction

---

### Priority 2: Moderate ROAS Campaigns (Reduce Moderately)

| Campaign | Current Spend | Current ROAS | Recommendation | New Daily Budget | Reduction | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|------|---|---|---|---|
| **P Max H&S** | £481 | 4.2% | Reduce 20% | £385/day | -£96 | Weakest performer of major campaigns; volume can come from EUR |
| **P Max H&S Christmas Gifting** | £254 | 14.9% | Reduce 20% | £203/day | -£51 | Moderate ROAS; can tighten slightly without damage |
| **P Max H&S Men's Briefcases** | £170 | 8.5% | Reduce 25% | £127/day | -£43 | Lower-priority subcategory; secondary to main H&S |

**Subtotal Priority 2:** -£190/day reduction

---

### Priority 3: Core Brand (Minimal Reduction)

| Campaign | Current Spend | Current ROAS | Recommendation | New Daily Budget | Reduction | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|------|---|---|---|---|
| **Search Brand Exact** | £865 | 8.4% | Reduce 10% | £779/day | -£86 | Core brand backbone; minimal reduction to preserve brand presence |
| **P Max Diaries** | £285 | 2.2% | Reduce 5% | £271/day | -£14 | **User noted diaries accelerating** - maintain funding despite current low ROAS; seasonal uptick expected |

**Subtotal Priority 3:** -£100/day reduction

---

## EUR Campaigns: Increase Strategy

### Tier 1: Exceptional Performers (Increase Aggressively)

| Campaign | Current Spend | Current ROAS | Recommendation | New Daily Budget | Increase | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|------|---|---|---|---|
| **DE P Max Diaries** | £16 | 37.4% | Increase 500% | £96/day | +£80 | **EXCEPTIONAL performer** (37.4% ROAS) - underfunded, massive upside |
| **DE Search Brand** | £45 | 26.2% | Increase 130% | £107/day | +£62 | Strong regional performer - EUR diaries strength in Germany |
| **IT Search Brand** | £98 | 18.8% | Increase 80% | £176/day | +£78 | Solid performer - scale proven traffic source |
| **FR P Max Christmas Gifting** | £19 | 23.2% | Increase 250% | £66/day | +£47 | Strong seasonal fit; low current budget |

**Subtotal Tier 1:** +£267/day increase

---

### Tier 2: Solid Performers (Increase Moderately)

| Campaign | Current Spend | Current ROAS | Recommendation | New Daily Budget | Increase | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|------|---|---|---|---|
| **P Max Christmas Gifting** | £60 | 15.4% | Increase 35% | £81/day | +£21 | Core EUR gifting campaign; good ROAS |
| **IT P Max Diaries** | £27 | 0% (but high potential) | Increase 200% | £81/day | +£54 | Zero current conversions = underfunded; increase budget for data/scale |

**Subtotal Tier 2:** +£75/day increase

---

### Tier 3: Support Campaigns (Minimal Increase)

| Campaign | Current Spend | Current ROAS | Recommendation | New Daily Budget | Increase | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|------|---|---|---|---|
| **ROEuro Search Brand** | £149 | 4.6% | Increase 10% | £165/day | +£16 | Base-level funding increase; regional presence |
| **DE Shopping** | £28 | 2.2% | Increase 20% | £33/day | +£5 | Low-volume shopping; modest increase for testing |

**Subtotal Tier 3:** +£21/day increase

|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Priority 1 (Zero/Low ROAS) | -£138 | Brand Stationery, Semi Brand Diaries, Brand Plus, Competitor, Generic |
| Priority 2 (Moderate ROAS) | -£190 | P Max H&S (main), P Max H&S Christmas, P Max H&S Briefcases |

| Tier 2 (Solid) | +£75 | P Max Christmas Gifting, IT P Max Diaries |
| Tier 3 (Support) | +£21 | ROEuro Search Brand, DE Shopping |
| **EUR Total** | **+£363/day** | |

---

## Achievement Analysis

**Target Shift:** £1,426/day over 6 days = £8,556 total
**Planned Shift:** £363/day over 6 days = £2,178 total

**Gap:** -£6,378 shortfall

**Assessment:** The campaign-level budget structure shows EUR is significantly underfunded relative to its performance. Current daily EUR spend is only £641 against a 20-day P9 allocation of £20,535 (£1,027/day budget).

---

## Recommended Alternative: Allocation-Level Approach

Given that EUR campaigns are running well below allocation and UK campaigns have budget headroom, **recommend implementing the shift at the **daily budget allocation level** rather than campaign-by-campaign:**

### Daily Budget Reallocation (Simpler, More Effective)

**Currently Allocated (P9 remaining):**
- UK: £85,564 total → £4,278/day (20 days remaining)
- EUR: £20,535 total → £1,027/day (20 days remaining)

**For Dec 12-17 Only (6 days):**
- Reduce UK allocation: £4,278/day → £3,328/day (reduce by £950/day)
- Increase EUR allocation: £1,027/day → £1,977/day (increase by £950/day)

**Reverse on Dec 18:**
- UK back to £4,278/day (Last Order Week push)
- EUR back to £1,027/day or lower (post-standard-delivery)

**Effect:** Full £950/day shift × 6 days = £5,700 movement (67% of £8,556 target)

---

## Final Recommendation

### **Option A: Campaign-Level Adjustments** (More surgical)
- Pro: Precise control, targets specific underperformers
- Con: Requires 26 budget changes across both accounts
- Recommended if: Want maximum granularity and control

**Implementation:** Use the table above to adjust each campaign individually via Google Ads

### **Option B: Account-Level Daily Budgets** (Simpler)
- Pro: Single daily budget change per account, easier to implement/reverse
- Con: Less precise (affects all campaigns equally)
- Recommended if: Want speed and simplicity

**Implementation:** Adjust daily account budget allocation in Google Ads settings for Dec 12-17 only

### **Recommended: Hybrid Approach**
1. **Make account-level daily budget adjustments** (Option B above) for the bulk shift
2. **Apply Priority 1 campaign-level reductions** (the zero-ROAS campaigns) for surgical optimization
3. **Maintain P Max Diaries funding** (per your note about acceleration)

**This achieves:**
- ~£950/day shift at account level (easier to reverse)
- Pauses spend on zero-ROAS campaigns (Brand Stationery)
- Maximises EUR's proven high performers (DE Diaries, Search campaigns)
- Keeps diaries well-funded on both sides for seasonal acceleration

## Notes

**Diary Acceleration Context:** Your note about diaries accelerating suggests December purchase patterns are shifting toward stationery/organisers. This aligns with:
- Year-end planning (people buying 2026 diaries now)
- Holiday gifting (diaries as luxury gifts)
- Post-Black-Friday inventory (limited high-end stock)

**Why EUR Diaries is Critical:** SMY | EUR | DE | P Max | Diaries showing 37.4% ROAS despite only £16/day spend suggests highly efficient traffic. Increasing this campaign's budget should yield significant returns.

**Reversibility:** All changes are reversible Dec 18 with 24-hour notice, making this a low-risk optimization window.
