# P9 Gradual Scaling Strategy - Realistic Ramp-Up

**Created:** December 19, 2025 (Evening)
**Issue:** Aggressive budget scaling (£2k → £15k) may not be technically feasible

---

## The Scaling Challenge

You're absolutely right to question the £2,000 → £15,000 jump. Here's why it won't work:

### Technical Limitations

1. **Budget Pacing Algorithm**
   - Google needs 12-24 hours to adjust to major budget changes
   - A 7.5x increase overnight will likely result in underspend
   - System won't trust the new budget immediately

2. **Impression Share Recovery**
   - Running at £2,000/day means we're probably at 20-30% impression share
   - Jumping to £15,000 won't instantly unlock 100% impression share
   - Auction eligibility needs time to rebuild

3. **Smart Bidding Adjustment**
   - Performance Max and Smart Shopping use machine learning
   - Sudden budget increases can trigger "learning phase"
   - Algorithm needs data points at new spend levels

4. **Time Zone Considerations**
   - UK Boxing Day starts while USA is still on Christmas Day
   - EUR is 1 hour ahead, ROW varies widely
   - Can't coordinate a global "switch flip"

## Revised Approach: Gradual Ramp-Up

### Strategy: "48-Hour Crescendo"

Start scaling on Dec 24 evening, build through Dec 25, peak Dec 26-28

### REVISED PROPOSAL: Realistic Scaling

| Date | Time | Daily Budget | vs Previous | Strategy |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Dec 22** | All day | £2,000 | Baseline | Maintain minimum |
| **Dec 23** | All day | £2,500 | +25% | Slight increase |
| **Dec 24** | 00:00-17:59 | £3,000 | +20% | Pre-sale prep |
| **Dec 24** | 18:00-23:59 | £5,000 | +67% | Sale launch ramp |
| **Dec 25** | 00:00-11:59 | £7,500 | +50% | Morning build |
| **Dec 25** | 12:00-23:59 | £10,000 | +33% | Afternoon acceleration |
| **Dec 26** | All day | £13,000 | +30% | BOXING DAY (realistic) |
| **Dec 27** | All day | £12,000 | -8% | Sustain |
| **Dec 28** | All day | £11,000 | -8% | P9 finish |
| **TOTAL** | | **£65,500** | | |

**Problem:** This exceeds our £53,239 budget by £12,261

## Budget-Constrained Realistic Scaling

### Working within £53,239 limit

| Date | Daily Budget | Cumulative | Strategy |
|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Dec 22** | £1,500 | £1,500 | Minimal |
| **Dec 23** | £2,000 | £3,500 | Slight increase |
| **Dec 24** | £3,500 | £7,000 | Gradual ramp (starts £2.5k, ends £4.5k) |
| **Dec 25** | £6,739 | £13,739 | Building momentum |
| **Dec 26** | £12,000 | £25,739 | BOXING DAY (achievable) |
| **Dec 27** | £14,000 | £39,739 | Sale peak |
| **Dec 28** | £13,500 | **£53,239** | Strong finish |

### Regional Allocation for Gradual Scaling

#### Dec 22-23: Foundation (£3,500 total)
- **UK:** £1,500 (43%)
- **USA:** £1,100 (31%)
- **EUR:** £650 (19%)
- **ROW:** £250 (7%)

#### Dec 24: Controlled Ramp (£3,500)
- **Morning (£1,500):** Normal distribution
- **6pm onwards (£2,000):** Increase all regions by 30-40%

#### Dec 25: Building Day (£6,739)
- **UK:** £2,800 (42%)
- **USA:** £2,200 (33%)
- **EUR:** £1,300 (19%)
- **ROW:** £439 (6%)

#### Dec 26: Boxing Day Reality (£12,000)
- **UK:** £5,000 (42%)
- **USA:** £3,800 (32%)
- **EUR:** £2,500 (21%) - High ROAS potential
- **ROW:** £700 (5%)

#### Dec 27-28: Sustain Peak (£27,500)
- **UK:** £11,500 (42%)
- **USA:** £8,800 (32%)
- **EUR:** £5,500 (20%)
- **ROW:** £1,700 (6%)

## Why This Works Better

### 1. Algorithm Adaptation
- 48-hour gradual increase from £1,500 to £12,000
- Each step is 30-50% increase (manageable)
- Gives Smart Bidding time to adjust

### 2. Impression Share Recovery
- Dec 24: Regain some lost ground
- Dec 25: Build auction presence
- Dec 26: Capitalize on recovered share

### 3. Regional Timing
- UK gets budget first (GMT timezone)
- USA follows (5-8 hours behind)
- Allows staggered optimization

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- If sale underperforms, easier to pull back
- If it overperforms, can deploy remaining buffer
- More data points for decision-making

## Campaign-Level Considerations

### Which Campaigns Can Scale?

**Fast Scalers (Can handle 2-3x quickly):**
- Performance Max (self-optimizing)
- Smart Shopping (if mature)
- Dynamic Search Ads

**Slow Scalers (Need gradual increase):**
- Standard Shopping (manual bids)
- Exact match Search (limited volume)
- Brand campaigns (finite demand)

### Recommended Mix for Scaling Days

**Dec 24-25 (Ramp Phase):**
- 60% to Performance Max
- 25% to Shopping
- 15% to Search

**Dec 26-28 (Peak Phase):**
- 50% to Performance Max
- 30% to Shopping (sale traffic)
- 20% to Search (sale searches)

## Implementation Timeline

### December 20 (Tomorrow)
- Review and approve gradual scaling plan
- Check Performance Max budget utilization today
- Identify which campaigns have headroom

### December 21
- Set Dec 22 budgets (£1,500 total)
- Configure graduated increases for Dec 23-24
- Test small increase to verify systems responding

### December 24
- 12pm: Check morning performance
- 5pm: Implement 6pm sale increase
- 10pm: Verify all regions scaling properly

### December 25
- 10am: Morning assessment
- 2pm: Decide Dec 26 final budgets
- 6pm: Ensure Boxing Day budgets ready

### December 26
- Hourly monitoring
- Ready to deploy emergency buffer if needed
- Document actual vs planned spend

## Alternative: Front-Load Strategy

If we're concerned about Boxing Day scaling, consider front-loading:

**Dec 20-21:** £8,000 (£4k/day) - Capture UK last orders
**Dec 22-23:** £3,000 (£1.5k/day) - Minimal
**Dec 24:** £4,000 - Sale launch
**Dec 25:** £8,000 - Christmas Day push
**Dec 26:** £12,239 - Boxing Day (realistic)
**Dec 27-28:** £18,000 (£9k/day) - Sustained

This uses the UK last-order weekend to "pre-spend" some budget while demand is still strong.

---

## Recommendation

**Go with the Gradual Scaling approach:**
- More technically feasible
- Gives algorithms time to adjust
- Allows course correction
- Still captures Boxing Day opportunity

**Key change from original:** Peak daily spend of £14,000 (not £15,739) and we build up to it over 48 hours rather than jumping overnight.

This is much more likely to actually spend the budget and deliver the returns we're targeting.
