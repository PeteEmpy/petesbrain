## Red Flags 🚨

1. ✅ **Daily spend** averaging £6,413/day (below £7,000 threshold mentioned in task)
2. 🚨 **Cumulative pacing** 16% over budget trajectory
3. 🚨 **Overspend factor increasing** - need to reduce spend by 31% (from £6,413 to £4,427) to stay on budget
4. ⚠️ **Only 14 days to correct** - limited time to adjust

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Reduce daily spend target to £4,400/day** across all accounts
2. **Prioritize UK account** (52% of spend) for budget reductions
3. **Monitor daily** for next 7 days to ensure correction working
4. **Client communication** - Inform Alex/Smythson team of budget pacing issue

### Budget Reduction Strategy

**Option 1: Proportional Reduction (-31% across all accounts)**
- UK: £3,346/day → £2,309/day (-£1,037)
- USA: £2,030/day → £1,401/day (-£629)
- EUR: £726/day → £501/day (-£225)
- ROW: £311/day → £215/day (-£96)

**Option 2: Prioritize Profitable Accounts**
- Reduce lower ROAS accounts more aggressively
- Maintain spend on high-performing campaigns
- Need to review ROAS by account to determine optimal allocation
