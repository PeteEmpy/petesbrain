## UK Campaigns: Budget Reductions

Reducing budget on underperforming campaigns (not diaries). Target: free up ~£500/day for EUR.

| Campaign | Current Budget | Current ROAS | New Budget | Daily Reduction | Reason |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P Max H&S** | £481/day | 4.2% | £350/day | **-£131** | Lowest ROAS among major campaigns |
| **Search Brand Stationery** | £99/day | 0% | £35/day | **-£64** | Zero conversions—no justification |
| **Search Brand Plus** | £129/day | 4.7% | £80/day | **-£49** | Below-target ROAS, redundant with Brand Exact |

**Total UK Reduction: -£244/day**

---

## EUR Campaigns: Budget Increases

Increasing budget on high-ROAS performers. Prioritise campaigns at/above ROAS target.

### High-Capacity Candidates (Room to grow within existing budget)

| Campaign | Current Budget | Current Spend | ROAS | Available Capacity | New Budget | Daily Increase |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FR P Max Christmas Gifting** | £30/day | £19/day | **23.2%** | £11/day | £30/day | **+£11** |

---

### High-ROAS, Currently Over-Budget (Raise budget ceiling)

These are performing exceptionally and have already exceeded their daily limits. Raise ceiling to let them run.

| Campaign | Current Budget | Current Spend | Overage | ROAS | Proposed New Budget | Daily Increase |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DE P Max Diaries** | £15/day | £16/day | +£1 | **37.4%** | £35/day | **+£20** |
| **DE Search Brand** | £44/day | £45/day | +£1 | **26.2%** | £59/day | **+£15** |
| **IT Search Brand** | £60/day | £98/day | +£38 | **18.8%** | £100/day | **+£40** |
| **ROEuro Search Brand** | £130/day | £149/day | +£19 | **4.6%** | £150/day | **+£20** |

**Total EUR Increase: +£106/day**

## Summary

| Region | Current | Proposed | Change |

## Implementation Notes

### Why These Selections?

**UK Reductions:**
- **P Max H&S** (£481→£350): Weakest performer of major campaigns at 4.2% ROAS; still well-resourced
- **Brand Stationery** (£99→£35): Zero conversions despite spend; easy elimination
- **Brand Plus** (£129→£80): Redundant with Brand Exact; Brand Exact owns core brand

**EUR Increases:**
- **FR P Max Christmas** (+£11): Has actual budget capacity; 23.2% ROAS earns the room
- **DE P Max Diaries** (+£20): Exceptional 37.4% ROAS; already exceeding budget, needs ceiling raised
- **DE Search Brand** (+£15): 26.2% ROAS; running over budget, deserves more headroom
- **IT Search Brand** (+£40): 18.8% ROAS; massively over budget (£98 vs £60), high-demand campaign
- **ROEuro Search Brand** (+£20): Base regional campaign; running over budget

### Timing

- **Dec 12 Morning:** Implement all budget changes (no campaign pauses)
- **Dec 12-17:** Monitor EUR ROAS daily (target: 800%+)
- **Dec 18 Morning:** Reverse all changes (restore original budgets)

### Result

- **Net shift to EUR:** ~£138/day (conservative, focused on high-ROAS only)
- **UK diaries protected:** Both UK P Max Diaries and Search Semi-Brand Diaries remain fully funded
- **Competitor protected:** Search Competitor campaign remains fully funded
- **No pauses:** All campaigns remain ENABLED
- **Reversible:** Single-day reversal on Dec 18
