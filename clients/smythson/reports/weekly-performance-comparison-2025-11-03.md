- **Return on Investment**: 266% → 308% (+16%)

## United Kingdom Performance

**Market Context**: The UK is our primary market, representing the largest share of advertising investment.

| **Average Order Value** | £139 | £133 | -4% |

**What This Means**:
- We deliberately reduced our advertising investment by 21% in the UK
- Sales decreased by 30%, which is proportionally higher than the spend reduction
- Return on investment remained strong at 336% (earning £3.36 for every £1 spent)
- This was part of planned strategic adjustments following your return to managing the account on October 23rd

**Strategic Context**: The week starting Oct 27 included several important optimizations:
- New asset groups launched for specific product categories (notebooks, travel bags, card holders)
- Continued refinement of the Diaries standalone campaign
- Testing of new advertising formats and audience targeting

## United States Performance

- Average order value **increased** by 5% to £245, indicating we're attracting higher-value customers
- This is our **best performing region** for efficiency this week

**Why This Happened**: The US market responded very well to optimization work, with Smart Bidding (Google's automated system) finding more valuable customers at lower costs.

## Europe Performance

**Market Context**: Europe covers 40 countries, with Germany as the dominant market (78% of European traffic).

| Metric | Previous Week (Oct 20-26) | Latest Week (Oct 27-Nov 2) | Change |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| **Sales Revenue** | £8,114 | £5,105 | -37% |

| **Orders** | 91 | 52 | -43% |
| **Average Order Value** | £89 | £98 | +10% |

**What This Means**:
- Europe experienced the largest proportional decline in sales volume
- However, return on investment remains very strong at 451% (£4.51 earned per £1 spent)
- Average order value **improved by 10%** - we're attracting better quality customers
- Lower investment was deliberate as we assess European market performance heading into Q4

**Important Context**: European conversion tracking is currently using a different system (Google Analytics 4) which may understate actual results. This is a known technical issue we're working to resolve.

## Rest of World Performance

**Market Context**: Covers 134+ countries including Singapore (our largest market in this region), Australia, Canada, and other international markets.

| Metric | Previous Week (Oct 20-26) | Latest Week (Oct 27-Nov 2) | Change |

| **Orders** | 20 | 14 | -30% |
| **Average Order Value** | £148 | £218 | +47% |

**What This Means**:
- Rest of World showed **remarkable efficiency improvement** - return jumped from 452% to 799%
- Despite cutting investment by 42%, sales actually **increased by 3%**
- Average order value soared by 47% to £218 - significantly higher quality customers
- This demonstrates excellent targeting and optimization work in international markets

**Strategic Significance**: These results suggest strong potential in international markets, particularly with Singapore and Australia performing well.

## What Drove These Changes?

The performance shifts between these two weeks were primarily driven by:

1. **Strategic Refinements (Oct 23-30)**: Following your return to managing the account, several optimizations were implemented:
   - Campaign consolidation in the UK (Brand Exact campaigns)
   - Launch of new product-specific advertising groups
   - Activation of advanced AI features in key campaigns
   - Budget reallocation based on early Q4 performance

2. **Learning Period Effects**: When significant changes are made, Google's automated bidding systems typically need 1-2 weeks to learn and optimize. The latest week reflects these systems beginning to find more efficient customer acquisition patterns.

3. **Intentional Budget Reductions**: Lower spend was planned as part of optimization work, not a constraint.

## Looking Ahead

**Positive Indicators**:
- ✅ **Efficiency improvements** across all regions (particularly US and ROW)
- ✅ **Higher average order values** in 3 out of 4 regions
- ✅ Strong return on investment maintained (all regions above 300%)
- ✅ Optimization work showing early positive signals

**Areas to Monitor**:
- UK sales volume decrease (larger than spend reduction) - continue monitoring campaign adjustments
- European order volume decline - assess market-specific factors
- Conversion tracking accuracy in EUR and ROW (technical issue being resolved)

**Strategic Context**: We're now entering Period 8 (Nov 3-30) with increased budget allocation (£218,653 for the month). The efficiency improvements achieved in late October position us well to scale effectively during this critical Q4 period.
