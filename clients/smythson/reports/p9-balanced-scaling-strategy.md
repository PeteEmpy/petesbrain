# P9 Balanced Scaling Strategy
**More campaigns, smarter distribution**

## Why Balanced is Better

### Previous Issues with Concentrated Approach:
- **Algorithm Shock**: £67 → £1,500 overnight could break delivery
- **Absorption Limits**: Single campaigns can't always scale 20x instantly
- **Lost Opportunity**: Ignoring 500-700% ROAS campaigns wastes potential
- **Single Points of Failure**: If top campaigns hit limits, no backup

### New Balanced Approach Benefits:
- **Gradual Scaling**: More reasonable 2-4x increases (not 20x)
- **Broader Coverage**: 50+ campaigns get budget (vs only 20)
- **Algorithm-Friendly**: Maintains spending patterns while scaling
- **Risk Distribution**: If some campaigns hit limits, others can absorb

## Tiered Budget Allocation

### Tier 1: Superstars (>1000% ROAS)
**Get largest increases but capped at 3-4x current spend**
- USA P Max Bags: £400 → £700 (not £1,500)
- EUR IT Search Brand: £200 → £400 (not £800)
- More sustainable scaling

### Tier 2: Strong Performers (700-1000% ROAS)
**Get solid 2-3x increases**
- UK Semi Brand Diaries: £500 → £800
- USA Brand Exact: £150 → £400
- These can handle good scale

### Tier 3: Solid Performers (500-700% ROAS)
**Get moderate 2x increases**
- UK P Max campaigns: 2x current budgets
- EUR Shopping campaigns: Reasonable scale
- Maintain breadth

### Tier 4: Decent Performers (400-500% ROAS)
**Get small increases to maintain presence**
- Brand variants and tests
- Keep algorithms active
- Ready if they improve

### Tier 5: Test Campaigns (<400% ROAS)
**Minimal or pause**
- Generic/Competitor with low ROAS
- Only token budgets

## Boxing Day Example (£12,000 total)

### UK (£5,000) - Now 14 campaigns active:
- Top 3 get £1,900 combined (vs £3,500 before)
- Next 5 get £1,750 combined
- Remaining 6 get £1,350 combined
- Better distribution, less risk

### USA (£3,800) - Now 14 campaigns active:
- Top 3 get £1,600 combined (vs £2,800 before)
- Next 4 get £1,050 combined
- Remaining 7 get £1,150 combined
- Smoother scaling

### EUR (£2,500) - Now 17 campaigns active:
- More campaigns participating
- Top performers still prioritized
- Better regional coverage

### ROW (£700) - Now 8 campaigns active:
- Broader test across markets
- Less concentration risk

## Scaling Pattern

### December 22-23: Minimal
- Keep most campaigns at low budgets
- Test the scaling on a few

### December 24 (6pm): Moderate Scale
- 1.5-2x increases for top performers
- 1.5x for solid performers
- Gradual ramp-up

### December 25: Continue Scale
- 2-3x from Dec 24 levels
- Monitor absorption rates
- Adjust if needed

### December 26 (Boxing Day): Maximum
- 3-4x for superstars (not 10-20x)
- 2-3x for strong performers
- Maintain breadth

### December 27-28: Sustained High
- Keep winners funded
- Watch for fatigue
- Ready to shift budgets

## Algorithm Considerations

**Google's Smart Bidding needs:**
- Historical data continuity
- Gradual changes (2-3x is fine, 10x is risky)
- Multiple signals from various campaigns
- Time to adjust to new budgets

**By keeping more campaigns active:**
- Algorithm has more data points
- Can optimize across portfolio
- Less likely to break delivery
- Natural budget flow to best performers

## Expected Benefits

### With Balanced Approach:
- **ROAS**: 850-950% (slightly lower but more reliable)
- **Revenue**: £110-130k (more consistent delivery)
- **Risk**: Much lower
- **Flexibility**: Can shift budgets between campaigns
- **Learning**: See which campaigns scale best

### Key Advantages:
1. **No shocking the algorithm**
2. **Natural optimization across portfolio**
3. **Backup options if top campaigns saturate**
4. **Maintains account health**
5. **Easier to implement and monitor**

## Implementation Notes

- Start with balanced CSV files
- Monitor hourly on Dec 24-26
- Be ready to shift budget between campaigns
- Watch for campaigns hitting budget limits
- Move budget from underperformers to overperformers

This balanced approach is much more likely to succeed while still prioritizing your best campaigns!
