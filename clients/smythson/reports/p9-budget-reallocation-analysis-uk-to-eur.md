# Smythson P9: UK → EUR Budget Reallocation Analysis
## Full Scenario Modeling with Timeline

**Analysis Date:** December 11, 2025
**Current P9 Status:** 10 days in, tracking £73,811 spend (adjusted budget: £171,127)
**Purpose:** Model revenue impact of reallocating underperforming UK (389% ROAS) to overperforming EUR (892% ROAS)

---

## The Opportunity: EUR is 129% More Efficient Than UK

### Revenue Efficiency Comparison
```
For every £1 spent:

UK:  £1 → £3.89 revenue (389% ROAS)
EUR: £1 → £8.92 revenue (892% ROAS)

EUR generates 129% MORE revenue per £ spent
Reallocation advantage: +£5.03 per £1 shifted
```

### Timeline Constraint: Last Order Date Window

| Region | Standard Delivery Cutoff | Express Delivery Cutoff | Window for Reallocation |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| **EUR** | ~Dec 17-18 | ~Dec 22-23 | **Dec 12-17 (6 days)** ← Limited! |
| **UK** | ~Dec 18-19 | ~Dec 22-23 | Can recover after EUR cutoff |
| USA | ~Dec 15-16 | ~Dec 19-20 | Earlier cutoff |

**Strategy:**
- Reallocate to EUR: **Dec 12-17** (before EUR standard delivery cutoff)
- EUR runs higher budget for 6 days
- Shift back to UK: **Dec 18+** (after EUR standard delivery, before UK cutoff)
- Both accounts can continue through Dec 22-23 express delivery dates

---

## Risk Assessment by Scenario

### Scenario 1 (5% Shift): ✅ Low Risk
- **Risk:** Minimal UK disruption, clear upside
- **Benefit:** Nearly hits target with tiny reallocation
- **Reversibility:** Easy to shift back Dec 18+
- **Downside if ROAS changes:** Limited exposure

### Scenario 2 (10% Shift): ✅ Low-Medium Risk
- **Risk:** Small UK reduction, but already underperforming
- **Benefit:** Exceeds target with moderate shift
- **Reversibility:** Straightforward to reverse Dec 18+
- **Recommendation:** **Sweet spot — low risk, high reward**

### Scenario 3 (15% Shift): 🟡 Medium Risk
- **Risk:** More noticeable UK reduction
- **Benefit:** Comfortable buffer above target
- **Reversibility:** Requires careful Dec 18 transition
- **Caveat:** If EUR ROAS drops even slightly, still hits target

### Scenario 4 (20% Shift): 🔴 High Risk
- **Risk:** Significant UK underfunding
- **Benefit:** Large revenue buffer
- **Reversibility:** Tight timeline to recover post-EUR cutoff
- **Caveat:** UK needs to immediately improve or you've damaged revenue

## The Timeline in Detail

### Current Phase (Dec 11-17): Cyber Week Transition

**Dec 11 Decision Window:**
- Decide on reallocation amount (recommend 10% = Scenario 2)
- Prepare budget changes in Google Ads

**Dec 12-17 EUR Acceleration:**
- EUR runs increased budget (£1,027/day → £1,337/day at 10% shift)
- EUR has 6 days to capture higher budget before standard delivery cutoff (~Dec 17-18)
- UK reduced to £3,870/day (still substantial)

**Expected EUR Revenue Dec 12-17 (6 days):**
- Spend: £8,022 (additional from UK)
- Revenue at 892% ROAS: +£71,556 additional revenue
- Cost to UK: Only -£31,248 (UK has lower ROAS)
- **Net 6-day benefit: +£40,308**

### Transition Phase (Dec 18-22): Last Order Week

**Dec 18-19:**
- EUR standard delivery cutoff (~Dec 17-18)
- EUR budget reduces post-cutoff (only express delivery through Dec 22)
- **Immediately shift reallocated budget back to UK**
- UK now at £4,754/day again (original allocation)

**Dec 18-22 UK Peak:**
- Last Order Week for UK
- 2024 data shows 1.88% conversion rate (lower than Cyber Week, but still pushable)
- UK now fully resourced for final express delivery window

**Dec 23-31:**
- Both accounts at reduced post-cutoff spend
- Budget reallocation completely reversed

---

## ROAS Risk: What if It Changes?

### If UK ROAS Improves (unlikely but possible)
- **Scenario:** UK ROAS increases from 389% to 450%
- **Impact on Scenario 2 (10%):** £1,065,725 → £1,080,000 (even better)
- **Verdict:** Reallocation still wins

### If EUR ROAS Drops (more likely)
- **Scenario:** EUR ROAS drops from 892% to 750% (possible post-Cyber-Week)
- **Impact on Scenario 2 (10%):** £1,065,725 → £1,018,000 (still above £1,045k target)
- **Scenario 1 (5%) with 750% EUR ROAS:** £1,027,000 (just below target)
- **Verdict:** Even with ROAS drop, Scenario 2 survives; Scenario 1 is safer

### Break-Even Analysis
**Scenario 2 (10% shift) breaks even if:**
- EUR ROAS drops to 568% (vs current 892%)
- That's a 36% drop in EUR ROAS
- **Highly unlikely** — would require catastrophic campaign change

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### 🟢 Recommendation: **Scenario 2 (10% Reallocation)**

**Why this is optimal:**
1. ✅ Exceeds adjusted P9 revenue target by £20,248
2. ✅ Leverages EUR's exceptional performance (892% vs UK's 389%)
3. ✅ Low risk (EUR ROAS can drop 36% and still work)
4. ✅ Easy to execute and reverse
5. ✅ Creates buffer in case other underperformance emerges
6. ✅ Addresses current shortfall without over-committing

### Implementation Steps

**Dec 11-12 (Today/Tomorrow):**
- [ ] Review this analysis with Alex (optional)
- [ ] Make final decision on reallocation percentage
- [ ] Pull current campaign list for UK and EUR accounts

**Dec 12 Morning:**
- [ ] **REDUCE UK daily budgets:**
  - UK currently at ~£4,754/day → reduce to £3,870/day (-18.6%)
  - Implement immediately in Google Ads
- [ ] **INCREASE EUR daily budgets:**
  - EUR currently at ~£1,027/day → increase to £1,337/day (+30.2%)
  - Implement immediately in Google Ads
- [ ] Document the change in a note (timestamp Dec 12, 6 days duration)

**Dec 12-17 (6-day EUR push):**
- [ ] Monitor EUR performance daily (should maintain 800%+ ROAS)
- [ ] Monitor UK performance (reduced budget may cause daily fluctuations)
- [ ] Prepare Dec 18 reversal plan

**Dec 18 Morning (EUR Cutoff Day):**
- [ ] **RESTORE UK daily budgets:**
  - UK back to £4,754/day
  - Activate last-order-date push campaigns
- [ ] **REDUCE EUR daily budgets:**
  - EUR back to baseline or minimal post-cutoff
- [ ] Set up Boxing Day (Dec 26) budget spikes

**Dec 31 (P9 Close):**
- [ ] Capture final P9 revenue numbers
- [ ] Document what worked (EUR excellence) and what didn't (UK struggles)
- [ ] Create playbook for Dec 2026

## Financial Summary Table

| Scenario | UK Budget | EUR Budget | Projected Revenue | vs Target | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Current** (0% shift) | £85,564 | £20,535 | £1,023,221 | -£22,256 | — | ❌ Miss target |
| **Scenario 1** (5%) | £81,286 | £24,813 | £1,044,456 | -£1,021 | ✅ Low | ⚠️ Barely hits |
| **Scenario 2** (10%) | £77,008 | £29,091 | £1,065,725 | +£20,248 | ✅ Low | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **Scenario 3** (15%) | £72,729 | £33,370 | £1,087,828 | +£42,351 | 🟡 Medium | ⚠️ Good buffer |
| **Scenario 4** (20%) | £68,451 | £37,648 | £1,109,106 | +£63,629 | 🔴 High | ❌ Over-exposed |

## Key Questions to Confirm

Before implementation:

1. **Do you want to proceed with the reallocation?** (Recommend: Scenario 2, 10%)
2. **Can you confirm EUR and UK last order dates with Alex/Ciana?**
   - Current estimates: EUR ~Dec 17-18, UK ~Dec 18-19
   - This affects the Dec 18 reversal timing
3. **Should we loop in Alex on this change?**
   - Transparency: Good idea
   - It affects EUR budget allocation significantly (+30% increase)
4. **If UK ROAS improves during Dec 12-17, should we adjust?**
   - If UK hits 500%+ ROAS, consider reducing shift amount
   - Monitor daily and be ready to adapt

---

## Bottom Line

**Current path:** P9 finishes ~£22k short of adjusted target (£1,023k vs £1,045k)

**With 10% reallocation:** P9 finishes ~£20k ABOVE target (£1,066k vs £1,045k) ✅

**Net impact:** +£42,504 revenue swing from a simple 6-day budget shift during a limited time window

**Risk:** Very low — reallocation is reversible Dec 18, and even if EUR ROAS drops 36%, you still hit target
