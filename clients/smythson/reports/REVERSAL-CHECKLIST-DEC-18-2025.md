## CRITICAL NOTES

**⚠️ DO NOT SKIP VERIFICATION**

Every single campaign must be verified BEFORE and AFTER reversal. Do not assume the changes worked—query and confirm each one.

**⚠️ TIMING IS CRITICAL**

- Dec 18 before 09:00 AM: Complete reversal
- This ensures UK campaigns are fully funded for Last Order Week (Dec 18-19)
- This ensures EUR budgets drop after standard delivery cutoff

**⚠️ IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG**

If verification fails on any campaign:
1. STOP immediately
2. Do not continue with remaining campaigns
3. Contact responsible party
4. Use backup document to identify which campaigns failed
5. Manually fix the failed campaigns one by one
