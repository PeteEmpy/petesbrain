### 4. ROW Account (5556710725)

## Phase Comparison vs Strategy

### Phase 1: Cyber Monday Week (Dec 1-7)
**Planned:** 35-40% of £183,929 = £64,375-73,572
**Actual:** £57,184 (31% of monthly budget)
**Status:** ⚠️ **Underspend of £7,191-16,388**

| Region | Spend | % of Phase 1 | % of Hist. | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| UK | £32,854 | 57.5% | 52.1% | Higher allocation |
| USA | £17,981 | 31.4% | 55.2% | Lower allocation |
| EUR | £4,080 | 7.1% | 19.0% | Significantly lower |
| ROW | £2,269 | 4.0% | 4.6% | On track |

**Analysis:**
- Phase 1 is £7-16k SHORT of strategy expectations
- UK received disproportionate budget (57% vs historical 52%)
- EUR appears to have been deliberately restricted (much lower spend)
- USA allocation is lower than its historical share

**Possible reasons:**
1. Conservative pacing due to unknown P8 final results/overspend impact on P9 budget
2. Deliberate EUR restraint to test efficiency (which is paying off - 968% ROAS!)
3. Awaiting confirmation of delivery cutoff dates or client adjustments

### Phase 2: Mid-December (Dec 8-14 expected, we have Dec 8-10)
**Planned:** 28-32% of monthly budget = £51,497-58,857
**Actual (3 days only):** £7,444 UK + £4,781 USA + £2,967 EUR + £1,435 ROW = **£16,627**
**Daily Average:** £5,542/day (pacing would give ~£38,794 for full 7 days if maintained)

**Assessment:** 3-day sample suggests Phase 2 is tracking below expected allocation (if current pace continues, would be ~38k vs 51-58k expected).

## ROAS Analysis vs Targets

### 2024 Benchmark ROAS vs 2025 Actual

| Account | 2024 Dec Avg | 2025 Dec 1-10 | Variance | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| UK | 966% | 389% | **-60%** | ⚠️ Significant underperformance |
| USA | 731% | 689% | **-6%** | ✅ On track |
| EUR | 435% | 892% | **+105%** | 🔥 Outstanding |
| ROW | [No data] | 461% | - | [New data point] |

**Critical Insight:** UK is significantly underperforming 2024 benchmarks while EUR is massively outperforming. This suggests:
- UK market may be saturated or campaign quality has declined
- EUR targeting/creative is extremely effective this year
- Possible budget reallocation opportunity: reduce UK aggression, increase EUR

---

## Revenue Pacing Analysis

### Cumulative to Date
**Spend:** £73,811 / £183,929 = **40.1% of monthly budget** (through 32.3% of period)
**Revenue:** £393,602 / £1,121,694 = **35.1% of P9 revenue target**

**Pacing:** If revenue maintains current rate, would hit **~£1,220k by month-end** (109% of target) ✅

**However:** This assumes stable ROAS, which is unlikely given:
- UK ROAS declining daily (Dec 1: 316% → Dec 10: 668% partial recovery)
- Phase 2 shows different (lower) spend levels
- Phase 3-5 budget reductions planned

---

## Red Flags & Opportunities

### 🚨 Red Flags
1. **UK ROAS Collapse:** 60% below 2024 December benchmarks
   - Dec 1: 316% ROAS (vs 1375% in 2024) - massive gap
   - Possible causes: market saturation, campaign fatigue, different product mix
   - **Action Required:** Review UK campaign settings, creative, targeting

2. **Phase 1 Underspend:** £7-16k below strategy expectations
   - Suggests conservative P9 budget may have been implemented
   - Could indicate P8 overspend reduced available P9 budget
   - **Action Required:** Confirm if P8 final results showed overspend/underspend

3. **Phase 2 Softness:** Dec 8-10 showing lower daily budgets than Phase 1
   - Planned to be similar (28-32% allocation) but smaller daily budgets
   - Could indicate planned reduction or conservative pacing
   - **Action Required:** Confirm Phase 2-5 budget allocations are correct

### ✅ Opportunities
1. **EUR Account Excellence:** 968% ROAS in Phase 1 (vs 341% benchmark)
   - EUR is dramatically outperforming expectations
   - **Opportunity:** Increase EUR budget allocation vs historical splits
   - Could shift 5-10% from UK to EUR for marginal revenue gain

2. **USA Stability:** 680% ROAS tracking well vs 646% benchmark
   - Consistent performer, maintaining 2024 levels
   - **Opportunity:** May have room for slight budget increases if capital available

3. **Cyber Monday (Dec 2) Peak:** USA hit £2,932 spend, 798% ROAS (strong)
   - Suggests Dec 2-3 window remains strong conversion opportunity
   - **Opportunity:** Replicate this setup for Boxing Day (Dec 26) execution

## Questions for Client (Alex Clarke)

1. **P8 Final Results:** Did P8 finish under/over budget? (This directly impacts P9 available budget)
2. **Delivery Cutoffs:** Confirmed last order dates for Christmas delivery?
   - UK Standard: Dec 18-19? Express: Dec 22-23?
   - USA Standard: Dec 15-16? Express: Dec 19-20?
   - EUR Standard: Dec 17-18? Express: Dec 22-23?
3. **Budget Adjustment:** If P9 budget was reduced due to P8 overspend, what's the adjusted total?
4. **UK Campaign Review:** Any product/campaign changes since P8? ROAS drop is concerning
5. **Boxing Day Plans:** Any special promotions/messaging for Dec 26? (2024 showed 1205-2929% ROAS)

- [ ] Monitor EUR efficiency - maintain allocation or increase
- [ ] Prepare Boxing Day (Dec 26) execution plan

### By Dec 15
- [ ] Deliver P1 (Dec 1-7) final analysis to client
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 3 (Last Order Week) budget transitions
- [ ] Confirm delivery cutoff dates from client

### Post-Christmas (Jan 2)
- [ ] Complete P9 final report with full revenue targets comparison
- [ ] Create playbook for P9 2026 execution
- [ ] Document UK ROAS decline root cause
