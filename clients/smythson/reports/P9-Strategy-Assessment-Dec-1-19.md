## Budget Performance Analysis

### Overall Budget Status

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P9 Total Budget** | £171,128 | 28 days (Dec 1-28) |
| **Days Elapsed** | 19 days | 67.9% of period |
| **Actual Spend** | £120,219.87 | |

**Observation:** Cyber Week strategy worked. ROAS strengthened as week progressed (464% → 1114%), peaking on final weekend days.

### Week 2: Dec 8-14 (Pre-Budget Increase)

| Date | Total Spend | Total Revenue | ROAS | Key Event |
|------|-------------|---------------|------|-----------|
| Dec 8 | £4,898.81 | £55,693.83 | 1137% | Post-Cyber consolidation |
| Dec 9 | £5,352.13 | £64,767.99 | 1210% | Strongest ROAS day |
| Dec 10 | £5,084.61 | £55,906.41 | 1100% | |
| Dec 11 | £4,612.14 | £42,123.59 | 913% | |
| Dec 12 | £4,652.71 | £32,382.66 | 696% | |
| Dec 13 | £4,860.97 | £48,515.07 | 998% | |
| Dec 14 | £6,030.41 | £52,763.94 | 875% | |

**Week 2 Total:** £35,491.78 spend, £352,153.49 revenue, **992% ROAS**

**Observation:** Post-Cyber Week sustained exceptional performance (avg 992% ROAS). Justified the Dec 15 budget increase decision.

### Week 3: Dec 15-19 (Budget Increase + Delivery Cutoffs)

| Date | Total Spend | Total Revenue | ROAS | Key Event |
|------|-------------|---------------|------|-----------|
| Dec 15 | £6,964.28 | £58,034.95 | 833% | **50% budget increase** |
| Dec 16 | £6,594.08 | £49,569.92 | 752% | USA/ROW delivery cutoff |
| Dec 17 | £4,659.08 | £37,632.41 | 808% | EUR delivery cutoff |
| Dec 18 | £4,069.39 | £18,449.63 | 453% | **Post-cutoff adjustments** (EUR -29%, ROW -18%) |
| Dec 19 | £4,656.71 | £18,859.49 | 405% | Reduced international spend |

**Week 3 Total:** £26,944.12 spend, £184,551.53 revenue, **685% ROAS**

**Critical Observations:**

1. **Dec 15 Budget Increase:** Spend jumped from £4-5K/day to £6-7K/day. ROAS remained strong (752-833%), validating the decision.

2. **Dec 16-17 Performance:** Last order dates for international markets. Strong ROAS maintained (752-808%).

3. **Dec 18-19 Drop:** ROAS fell to 453% and 405% after post-cutoff adjustments. **This is expected and appropriate** — international markets reduced spend post-cutoff, leaving primarily UK traffic with naturally lower ROAS than USA/EUR's exceptional 900%+ rates.

4. **UK Dec 18-19 ROAS:** Isolated UK performance shows:
   - Dec 18: £2,498.71 spend → £7,362.42 revenue = **295% ROAS**
   - Dec 19: £2,928.23 spend → £8,051.67 revenue = **275% ROAS**

   UK is performing **below its 300% target** on these days, but this is likely due to:
   - Post-Dec 17 reduction in international campaigns (overall account efficiency drops)
   - Approaching UK cutoff (Dec 21) — users may be hesitant to order
   - Weekend vs weekday performance variance

## Strategic Assessment: Is P9 Working?

### ✅ YES — P9 Strategy is Highly Effective

**Evidence:**

1. **Budget Execution:** On track (70.2% spent, 67.9% of period elapsed)

2. **ROAS Performance:** All regions exceeding targets by 2-6x
   - UK: 639% vs 300% target ✅
   - USA: 948% vs 150% target ✅
   - EUR: 878% vs 150% target ✅
   - ROW: 544% vs 100% target ✅

3. **Strategic Decisions Validated:**
   - ✅ **Cyber Week activation** (Dec 2-7): Delivered 645% ROAS, captured seasonal demand
   - ✅ **Budget reallocation** (Dec 11): EUR +£224/day was justified (878% ROAS)
   - ✅ **50% budget increase** (Dec 15): Maintained strong ROAS (752-833%) with higher spend
   - ✅ **Post-cutoff adjustments** (Dec 18): Appropriate reduction after delivery deadlines passed

4. **Revenue Delivery:** £909,255.22 revenue from £120,219.87 spend = exceptional return

### ⚠️ Areas of Attention

1. **UK Recent Performance (Dec 18-19):**
   - UK ROAS has dropped to 275-295% (below 300% target)
   - **Assessment:** Likely temporary due to post-international-cutoff effect + pre-UK-cutoff hesitancy
   - **Action:** Monitor Dec 20-21 performance closely (final UK push before cutoff)

2. **Dec 18-19 Overall ROAS Drop:**
   - Overall ROAS fell to 405-453% (from 750-800% average)
   - **Assessment:** Expected and appropriate — this reflects the shift to UK-only focus post-international-cutoffs
   - **No concern:** Still 4-5x above baseline profitability

3. **Unallocated Budget Buffer:**
   - £16,408.13 remains unallocated in final 9 days
   - **Opportunity:** Can be deployed if Boxing Day performance matches 2024 (1000%+ ROAS expected)

---

## Recommendations for Dec 20-28

### 1. Execute Planned Budget Distribution
Proceed with the documented strategy:
- Dec 20-21: £5,000/day (UK final push)
- Dec 22-23: £1,000/day (minimal pre-sale)
- Dec 24-28: Sale period (£3K, £1.5K, £8K, £5K, £5K)

### 2. Monitor UK Performance Dec 20-21
- **Critical period:** Last 2 days before UK delivery cutoff
- **Target:** Return to 300%+ ROAS on UK account
- **If ROAS stays below 300%:** Consider pulling back Dec 21 spend slightly
- **If ROAS recovers to 350%+:** Full £5K/day is justified

### 3. Boxing Day Opportunity (Dec 26)
- **2024 benchmark:** 1205% UK, 1638% USA, 2929% EUR ROAS on Boxing Day
- **Current buffer:** £16,408.13 unallocated
- **Recommendation:** If Dec 24-25 ROAS is strong (>600%), increase Dec 26 budget from £8,000 to £12,000 (deploy £4K from buffer)

### 4. Sale Period Strategy Validation
- **Historical data:** Dec 23-29, 2024 delivered 1000%+ ROAS across all regions
- **Current strategy:** Only £22,500 allocated for Dec 24-28 (5 days)
- **Opportunity:** If sale performance matches 2024, deploy full £16K buffer into Dec 26-28

### 5. Final Week Flexibility
Keep £10-15K buffer for:
- Opportunistic deployment if sale ROAS exceeds 800%
- Contingency if any technical issues arise
- Final push on Dec 28 if under budget

## Conclusion

**The P9 strategy is working exceptionally well.** All strategic decisions (Cyber Week activation, budget reallocation, Dec 15 increase, post-cutoff adjustments) have been validated by performance data. The account is on track to finish P9 under budget with strong profitability.

**Next Critical Period:** Dec 20-21 (final UK push before cutoff) and Dec 26 (Boxing Day spike opportunity)

**Strategic Posture:** Confident but vigilant. Monitor UK performance closely Dec 20-21; be ready to deploy buffer budget if Boxing Day matches 2024 benchmarks.
