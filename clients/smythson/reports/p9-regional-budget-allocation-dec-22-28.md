## Recommendation: Proposal A with Flexibility

**I recommend Proposal A** as the baseline, with the flexibility to shift budget between regions based on Dec 24-25 performance.

**Key execution points:**

1. **Dec 22-23:** Keep ultra-minimal but maintain tracking
2. **Dec 24 (6pm):** Monitor sale launch closely - which regions respond first?
3. **Dec 25:** Use as test day - early indicators of regional strength
4. **Dec 26 AM:** Be ready to reallocate based on Dec 24-25 data
5. **Dec 26-28:** Scale aggressively in best-performing regions

**Budget Hold Strategy:**
- Keep £5,000 unallocated until Dec 25 evening
- Deploy this to strongest performers for Dec 26-28

---

## Risk Mitigation

### If sale underperforms:
- Quickly reduce Dec 27-28 budgets
- Shift to UK focus (most reliable)
- Cap daily spend at £10,000

### If sale overperforms:
- Use full £18,739 buffer
- Prioritize regions showing >1000% ROAS
- Consider requesting emergency budget increase

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and select preferred proposal
2. Set up budget changes for Dec 22 (reduce all regions)
3. Configure Dec 24 PM increase (ready for 6pm launch)
4. Schedule Dec 26 maximum budgets
5. Create monitoring dashboard for hourly tracking Dec 24-26

**Decision needed by:** December 21 (tomorrow) to implement pre-sale reductions
