**December 22-28, 2025**

## Budget Allocation Principles

### Tier 1: Super Performers (>1000% ROAS)

- USA: P Max Bags (1502%), P Max Zombies (1295%), P Max Diaries (1163%)
- EUR: IT Search Brand (1903%), DE Search Brand (1021%)
- These campaigns get maximum scale during Dec 26-28

### Tier 2: Strong Performers (700-1000% ROAS)
**Get 35% of budget during sale days**
- UK: Semi Brand Diaries (943%), Brand Exact (810%)
- USA: Brand Exact (960%)
- EUR: ROEuro Search Brand (923%)
- ROW: Search Brand campaigns (706%)

### Tier 3: Solid Performers (500-700% ROAS)
**Get 20% of budget during sale days**
- UK: P Max campaigns (548-599%)
- EUR: Shopping & other P Max
- ROW: AUS Search Brand (621%)

### Tier 4: Underperformers (<500% ROAS)
**Get minimal budget or pause**
- Generic/Competitor campaigns
- Low-performing P Max campaigns

## Daily Budget Distribution

### December 22-23: Minimal Phase
**Keep budgets low, preserve for sale**
- Focus only on Tier 1 & 2 campaigns
- Pause or minimize Tier 4 campaigns

### December 24 (6pm): Sale Launch
**Immediate scale to high performers**
- Tier 1 campaigns: Scale to 3-4x normal
- Tier 2 campaigns: Scale to 2-3x normal
- Keep others minimal

### December 26 (Boxing Day): Maximum Push
**All budget to proven winners**
- USA P Max Bags: £1,500 (was getting 1502% ROAS!)
- EUR IT Search Brand: £1,000 (was getting 1903% ROAS!)
- UK Semi Brand Diaries: £1,500
- UK Brand Exact: £2,000

### Key Changes from Original Plan

1. **USA Focus Shift**: Heavy emphasis on P Max Bags, Zombies, and Diaries (all >1100% ROAS)
2. **EUR Concentration**: Push IT and DE Search Brand campaigns hard
3. **UK Optimization**: Prioritize Semi Brand Diaries and Brand Exact
4. **ROW Selective**: Only fund Search Brand campaigns

## Risk Mitigation

- Set shared budgets where possible for flexibility
- Monitor hourly on Dec 24 after 6pm launch
- Have £5k emergency budget ready for super performers
- Use automated rules with hourly checks

- Revenue potential: £120k-£140k on remaining £53k spend
- Total P9 revenue: £997k-£1,017k
