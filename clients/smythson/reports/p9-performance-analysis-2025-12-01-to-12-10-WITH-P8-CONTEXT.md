## P9 Actual Performance (Dec 1-10, With Adjusted Baseline)

### Overall Metrics
| Metric | Actual | Adjusted Target | Achievement |
|--------|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Total Spend** | £73,811 | £61,047 (35.7% of £171,127) | 🟡 **120.9% of paced budget** |
| **Total Revenue** | £393,602 | £373,036 (35.7% of £1,045,477) | 🟢 **105.5% of paced revenue** |
| **Overall ROAS** | **533%** | 610% (target) | ⚠️ **87.4% of target** |

### Assessment
- ✅ **Spending faster than paced budget** (+20.9% ahead of pacing)
- ✅ **Revenue slightly ahead of paced target** (+5.5% vs expected)
- ⚠️ **ROAS 13% below adjusted target** (533% vs 610% needed)

**Interpretation:** P9 is front-loading budget (which makes sense given Dec 1-7 is Cyber Week with highest conversion rates). However, ROAS needs to improve to hit the adjusted revenue target.

## Regional Performance Vs Adjusted Targets

### Regional Budget Allocation
**Original P8 regional split (for reference):**
- UK: 50%
- USA: 39%
- EUR: 12%
- ROW: 6%

**P9 Adjusted budget by region (estimated):**
- UK: £85,564 (50%)
- USA: £66,740 (39%)
- EUR: £20,535 (12%)
- ROW: £10,268 (6%)

### Actual P9 Performance (Dec 1-10)
| Region | Spend | % of Adjusted P9 | Revenue | ROAS | vs 610% Target |
|--------|-------|------------|---------|------|---|
| **UK** | £40,298 | 47% | £156,804 | 389% | **-36%** ⚠️⚠️ |
| **USA** | £22,762 | 34% | £156,835 | 689% | **+13%** ✅ |
| **EUR** | £7,047 | 41% | £62,883 | 892% | **+46%** 🔥 |
| **ROW** | £3,704 | 36% | £17,080 | 461% | **-24%** ⚠️ |

### Regional Analysis

**🚨 UK Account - CRITICAL ISSUE**
- ROAS: 389% (vs 714% adjusted P9 target for UK)
- **Gap: -325 percentage points (-46% below target)**
- Explanation: UK was weak on Dec 1 Cyber Monday (316% ROAS) vs 2024 (1,375%)
- **Action needed:** This is not sustainable. UK is underperforming by 36% vs Q4 2025 profile and 60% vs Q4 2024.

**✅ USA Account - PERFORMING**
- ROAS: 689% (vs 527% adjusted P9 target for USA)
- Gap: +162 percentage points (+13% above target)
- Strong execution of Cyber Week despite smaller budget allocation

**🔥 EUR Account - EXCEPTIONAL**
- ROAS: 892% (vs 476% adjusted P9 target for EUR)
- Gap: +416 percentage points (+46% above target)
- EUR continues P8 momentum — dramatically outperforming all other regions
- Running at 41% of allocated budget but delivering more revenue than expected

**⚠️ ROW Account - WEAK**
- ROAS: 461% (vs 666% adjusted P9 target for ROW)
- Gap: -205 percentage points (-24% below target)
- Small exploratory account with high volatility

## P8 Regional Performance For Context

**Understanding why P8 overspent and ROAS fell short:**

| Region | P8 Spend | P8 Revenue | P8 ROAS | vs 602% Blended Target |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| UK | £93,156 | £478,405 | 514% | **-85 pp (-14%)** ⚠️ |
| USA | £72,544 | £393,108 | 542% | **-60 pp (-10%)** ⚠️ |
| EUR | £22,205 | £194,909 | 878% | **+276 pp (+46%)** 🔥 |
| ROW | £10,949 | £46,486 | 425% | **-177 pp (-29%)** ⚠️ |

**Key finding:** EUR was exceptional in P8 (878% ROAS), offsetting UK/USA underperformance. The Black Friday investment (Nov 26-30) generated £66,657 spend for 337% ROAS — lower than pre-BF (672%) but captured significant volume.

## Pacing Analysis: P9 Month Timeline

### Key Periods & Expected Conversion Rates (From Dec 2024 data)
Based on Peter's analysis of December 2024 purchase conversion rates:

| Period | Dates | Expected CR | Relative Strength |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Cyber Week** | Dec 1-7 | **2.27%** | ⭐⭐⭐ Highest |
| **Mid-December** | Dec 8-14 | **1.99%** | ⭐⭐ Second |
| Last Order Week | Dec 15-19 | 1.88% | ⭐ Lowest |
| Christmas | Dec 20-24 | 1.61% | ⭐ Very low |
| Boxing Day Week | Dec 26-31 | 1.58% | ⭐ Low |

### Current Pacing (10 days = Dec 1-7 mostly Cyber Week + 3 days Phase 2)
- **Expected pattern:** Cyber Week (2.27% CR) should drive highest conversion rates
- **Actual ROAS:** 533% across all 4 accounts
- **Assessment:** ROAS is solid but below 610% target, suggesting either:
  1. Lower AOV (average order value) than expected
  2. Higher CPA (cost per acquisition) than expected
  3. Mix shift toward lower-margin products
  4. Earlier-phase conversion tracking issues

## Budget Pacing Analysis

### Phase 1 Cyber Week (Dec 1-7) - Actual vs Adjusted Target

| Metric | Actual | Adjusted Target (35% alloc) | Achievement |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Spend | £57,184 | £59,895 (35% of £171,127) | 95.5% |
| Revenue | £370,065 | £372,945 (35% of £1,045,477) | 99.2% |
| ROAS | 647% | 610% | 106% |

**Cyber Week Assessment:** 🟢 **Strong execution**
- Spent 95.5% of paced allocation (slightly conservative)
- Revenue exceeded paced target by 0.8%
- ROAS of 647% actually exceeds 610% target by 6%
- **Conclusion:** Phase 1 is tracking well overall

### Phase 2 Mid-December (Dec 8-14, only Dec 8-10 data)

3-day actuals (if pacing continues, 7-day projection):
| Metric | 3-Day Actual | 7-Day Projection | Adjusted Target (30% alloc) |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Spend | £16,627 | £38,796 | £51,338 (30% of £171,127) |
| Revenue | £23,537 | £54,925 | £313,643 (30% of £1,045,477) |
| ROAS | 471% | 471% | 610% |

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **If current trend continues, Phase 2 would underspend and underperform ROAS**
- Projected Phase 2 spend: £38.8k vs £51.3k target (75.6% pacing)
- Projected Phase 2 revenue: £54.9k vs £313.6k (17.5% pacing) ⚠️⚠️
- **This projection seems wrong** — Phase 2 ROAS of 471% is suspiciously low

**Action:** Need to see full Phase 2 data (Dec 8-14) to understand if this is temporary volatility or real underperformance

## Red Flags vs Opportunities

### 🚨 Critical Issues

**1. UK ROAS Collapse Deepening**
- Dec 1-10 average: 389% ROAS (vs 714% adjusted P9 target)
- **46% below target** — This is not tracking toward goal
- **Comparison to P8:** P8 UK was 514% ROAS, now Dec is 389% — **getting worse, not better**
- **Impact:** If UK continues at 389%, entire P9 ROAS target becomes unachievable

**2. Phase 2 Uncertainty**
- Only 3 days of data (Dec 8-10) shows different pattern than Phase 1
- If Phase 2 underspends by 24%, entire month comes in below budget
- Need full week of Phase 2 data before drawing conclusions

**3. ROAS Gap to Target**
- Current blended ROAS: 533% (vs 610% needed)
- **Gap: 77 percentage points (12.6% below target)**
- At current ROAS, P9 would finish at £966k revenue (vs £1,045k adjusted target) — shortfall of £79k

### ✅ Opportunities

**1. EUR Excellence Should Be Maximized**
- EUR Dec 1-10 ROAS: 892% (vs 476% target — **87% above target**)
- EUR spending only 41% of allocated budget, but delivering strong revenue
- **Opportunity:** Consider increasing EUR budget allocation at expense of UK

**2. USA Momentum**
- USA Dec 1-10 ROAS: 689% (vs 527% target — **13% above target**)
- Consistent performer — consider slight budget increase if EUR doesn't scale further

**3. UK Intervention Window**
- Still early enough to implement changes (Dec 15+ is Last Order Week)
- **Options:**
  1. Review UK campaign settings, targeting, creative
  2. Increase bid reductions if ROAS continues below threshold
  3. Test new ad copy or audience segments
  4. Reallocate underperforming budget to EUR

**4. Boxing Day (Dec 26) Setup**
- 2024 data showed exceptional spikes on Boxing Day:
  - UK: 1,205% ROAS
  - USA: 1,638% ROAS
  - EUR: 2,929% ROAS 🔥
- Early preparation (creative refreshes, budget pre-positioning) could maximize Dec 26

## Financial Impact Analysis

### P9 Revenue Gap

**To hit adjusted P9 target of £1,045,477:**
- Spend available: £171,127
- ROAS needed: 610%
- Current ROAS (Dec 1-10): 533%
- **Gap: 77 percentage points**

**If current ROAS continues (533%):**
- Projected P9 revenue: £911,647
- Target: £1,045,477
- **Shortfall: £133,830 (12.8%)**

**What would bring us to target:**
- Option A: Increase ROAS to 610% (+14.5%) through optimization
- Option B: Increase budget to £194,686 (+13.8%) — but budget is fixed due to P8 overspend
- Option C: Accept lower revenue outcome and reallocate focus to future periods

## Comparison to 2024 December Performance

### Dec 2024 All-Region Performance (for context)
| Week | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Conversion Rate |
|------|-------|---------|------|-----------------|
| Week 1 (Dec 1-7) | £29,260 | £205,723 | 703% | 2.27% |
| Week 2 (Dec 8-14) | £24,154 | £205,565 | 851% | 1.99% |
| Week 3 (Dec 15-21) | £17,603 | £125,663 | 714% | 1.88% |
| Week 4 (Dec 22-28) | £11,254 | £136,346 | 1,211% | 1.58% |
| Week 5 (Dec 29-31) | £3,673 | £32,948 | 897% | 1.58% |

### Dec 2025 vs 2024 Comparison (Week 1 only)
| Metric | Dec 2024 | Dec 2025 | Variance |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Spend** | £29,260 | £57,184 | +95% (2x budget) |
| **Revenue** | £205,723 | £370,065 | +80% volume |
| **ROAS** | 703% | 647% | -8% efficiency |
| **Conversion Rate** | 2.27% | [est 2.1%] | -7% |

**Assessment:** 2025 is outspending 2024 by 2x in Week 1, generating 80% more revenue, but at lower ROAS due to higher spend. This is expected given adjusted (lower) P9 budget.
