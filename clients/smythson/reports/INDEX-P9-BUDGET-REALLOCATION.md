## ⚠️ KEY SAFEGUARDS

1. **Before Reversal:** Query all 12 campaigns to confirm current state matches LIVE amounts
2. **Verify Each Campaign:** Do not assume—query each budget after reversal
3. **No Partial Reversals:** All 12 campaigns must be completed, not just some
4. **Backup Verification:** Use `backup-current-budgets-20251211.txt` to confirm original amounts
5. **Issue Protocol:** If any campaign won't update, STOP and contact responsible party
