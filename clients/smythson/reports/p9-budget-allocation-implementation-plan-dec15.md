## Phase 2A: Last Order Period (Dec 15-16 midnight) - 2 Days
**Deploy:** Monday Dec 15, 3pm (after Alex approves)
**Duration:** 2 days (until midnight 16th Dec - last orders close)
**Total Budget:** £11,500 (£5,750/day)

### Daily Budget Targets by Account

| Account | Current (Dec 14) | Target (Dec 15-16) | Change | Action |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| **UK** (8573235780) | £3,100/day | £3,050/day | -£50 (-2%) | Slight reduction |
| **USA** (7808690871) | £1,750/day | £1,725/day | -£25 (-1%) | Minimal adjust |
| **EUR** (7679616761) | £1,050/day | £690/day | -£360 (-34%) | Significant reduction |
| **ROW** (5556710725) | £300/day | £288/day | -£12 (-4%) | Minimal adjust |
| **TOTAL** | £6,200/day | £5,750/day | -£450 (-7%) | |

**Key Strategy:**
- All regions at full Last Order Week budgets
- Last orders close: **11:59pm GMT on 16th December** for US/EUR/ROW
- UK last order date different (to be confirmed)
- EUR: Major reduction from £1,050 → £690 (reverting Dec 11 reallocation + normalizing)

**Budget Allocation:**
- 2 days × £5,750/day = £11,500 total

---

## Phase 2B: Post Last Orders (Dec 17-22) - 6 Days
**Deploy:** Wednesday Dec 17, 8am
**Duration:** 6 days
**Total Budget:** £34,500 (£5,750/day)

### Daily Budget Targets by Account

| Account | Last Order (Dec 15-16) | Post Last Order (Dec 17-22) | Change | % of Previous |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **UK** (8573235780) | £3,050/day | £3,857/day | +£807 (+26%) | **127%** (receives reallocated budget) |
| **USA** (7808690871) | £1,725/day | £1,208/day | -£517 (-30%) | **70%** (post last orders) |
| **EUR** (7679616761) | £690/day | £483/day | -£207 (-30%) | **70%** (post last orders) |
| **ROW** (5556710725) | £288/day | £202/day | -£86 (-30%) | **70%** (post last orders) |
| **TOTAL** | £5,750/day | £5,750/day | £0 (0%) | |

**Key Strategy:**
- **Last orders closed** for US/EUR/ROW at midnight 16th December
- Reduce US/EUR/ROW to **70%** of Last Order Week levels at 8am on 17th
- Reallocate saved budget (£810/day) to **UK** for final Christmas push
- UK benefits from full budget allocation as it continues taking orders
- No campaigns paused - all continue running at adjusted levels

**Budget Reallocation:**
- US/EUR/ROW reduction saves: £810/day
- UK receives: £807/day additional budget (£3,050 → £3,857)
- Maintains total daily budget at £5,750/day

**Budget Allocation:**
- 6 days × £5,750/day = £34,500 total

**Combined Phase 2 Total:**
- Phase 2A + 2B: £11,500 + £34,500 = £46,000 total

---

## Phase 3: Christmas Lull (Dec 23-25) - 3 Days
**Deploy:** Sunday Dec 22, 6pm
**Duration:** 3 days
**Total Budget:** £9,000 (£3,000/day)

### Daily Budget Targets by Account

| Account | Last Order (Dec 15-22) | Christmas (Dec 23-25) | Change | % of Previous |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|--------|---------------|
| **UK** (8573235780) | £3,050/day | £1,800/day | -£1,250 (-41%) | **100%** (no reduction) |

| **ROW** (5556710725) | £288/day | £120/day | -£168 (-58%) | **70%** reduction |
| **TOTAL** | £5,750/day | £3,000/day | -£2,750 (-48%) | |

**Strategy:**
- UK maintains full budgets (Christmas is strong in UK market - 927% ROAS in 2024)
- USA/EUR/ROW reduced to 70% of Last Order Week levels
- Lower spend but expect 850% ROAS (2024 showed 945%)

**Budget Allocation:**
- 3 days × £3,000/day = £9,000 total

**Deploy:** Wednesday Dec 25, 6pm (Christmas evening)
**Duration:** 1 day
**Total Budget:** £10,000

|---------|----------------------|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| **UK** (8573235780) | £1,800/day | £5,000 | +£3,200 (+178%) | 1,205% |
| **USA** (7808690871) | £800/day | £3,500 | +£2,700 (+338%) | 1,638% |

| **TOTAL** | £3,000/day | £10,000 | +£7,000 (+233%) | 1,515% avg |

**Strategy:**
- MAXIMIZE all regions - this is the goldmine day
- 2024 showed 1,515% average ROAS across all regions
- Every region had 1,000%+ ROAS on Boxing Day 2024
- Single day could generate £135,000 revenue (12% of P9 total)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Deploy evening of Dec 25 to be ready for midnight traffic

**Deploy:** Thursday Dec 26, 6pm
**Duration:** 2 days (P9 ends Dec 28)

| **TOTAL** | £10,000 | £5,995/day | -£4,005 (-40%) | 921% avg |

**Strategy:**
- Sustained high budgets through P9 end (Dec 28)
- Still excellent ROAS period (921% in 2024)
- 2 days × £5,995/day = £11,989 total
- Final push to close P9 strong

## Risk Mitigation

### Budget Overspend Risk
- **Mitigation:** Daily monitoring Dec 14-28
- **Action:** If trending >£6,000/day average, reduce budgets 5-10% immediately
- **Threshold:** Alert if cumulative spend >£85,000 by Dec 26

### ROAS Underperformance
- **Mitigation:** 2024 baseline showed 800%+ in all post-Dec 15 phases
- **Action:** If any phase <600% ROAS, reduce next phase budgets by 10%
- **Threshold:** Alert if any region <500% ROAS for 2+ consecutive days

### Algorithm Learning Periods
- **Mitigation:** Budget changes are moderate (not >50% in single change)
- **Action:** Monitor ROAS impact 24-48 hours after each deployment
- **Recovery:** If ROAS drops >20%, consider partial reversal

---

## Success Metrics

## P10 Planning (Dec 29 - Jan 25, 2026)

### P10 Budget
- **Paid Search Budget:** £143,471
- **Period:** 5 weeks (Dec 29 - Jan 25)
- **Planning Status:** To be finalized in New Year

### Key Considerations
- Many team members off over Christmas/New Year
- Peter back ~Jan 4 (taking computer, not off-grid)
- Budget strategy to be decided: maintain Phase 5 levels or adjust?
- Historical context: January conversion rates typically lower than December
- Need to review January 2024/2025 performance trends

### Open Questions for January
1. Should we maintain Phase 5 budget levels (£5,995/day) into P10?
2. What was the conversion rate drop from Dec to Jan in 2024?
3. Budget allocation across 5-week period vs 4-week standard
4. Sale continuation strategy and impact on budget allocation

### Action Items
- [ ] Review January 2024 conversion rates (first 2 weeks vs full month)
- [ ] Get final P10 demand revenue targets from Alex
- [ ] Confirm budget allocation strategy for 5-week period
- [ ] Plan budget deployment for Jan 4+ when Peter returns

---

**Next Step:** Get Alex approval in 1pm meeting, then execute Phase 2A deployment at 3pm.
