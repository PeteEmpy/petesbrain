@Alex Clarke — Quick P9 opportunity:

EUR is running 892% ROAS vs UK's 389%. We have a 6-day window (Dec 12-17, before EUR's delivery cutoff) to shift 10% of UK budget to EUR.

**Expected:**
- Dec 12-17 reallocation: +£42k revenue
- Dec 26 Boxing Day spike (separate): +£66k revenue
- **Total: +£108k** (finishes P9 at £1,131k vs £1,045k target)

**Reversible:** EUR cutoff is Dec 17, UK's is Dec 18-19. We flip budgets back Dec 18 for UK's peak period.

**Ask:** OK to proceed with Phase 1 (reallocation Dec 12-17) and plan Phase 2 (Boxing Day) based on Dec 1-17 results?
