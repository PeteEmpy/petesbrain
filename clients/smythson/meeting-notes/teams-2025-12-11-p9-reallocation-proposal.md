# Teams Message: P9 Budget Reallocation Proposal

---

**@Alex Clarke** — P9 opportunity: EUR is dramatically outperforming, and we have a 6-day window to capitalize before their delivery cutoff.

## The Situation
We're tracking to finish P9 about £22k short of the adjusted revenue target (£1,023k vs £1,045k). The issue: UK is underperforming at 389% ROAS while EUR is exceptional at 892% ROAS — that's 129% more efficient.

**The good news:** EUR hasn't reached capacity, and their last order date (Dec 17-18) comes before UK's (Dec 18-19). This gives us a reversible window.

## The Proposal

### Phase 1: Reallocation Window (Dec 12-17)
Temporarily shift 10% of UK budget to EUR for 6 days:
- **UK:** Reduce from £4,754/day to £3,870/day
- **EUR:** Increase from £1,027/day to £1,337/day
- **Why:** Capture EUR's 892% ROAS on additional spend before their standard delivery cutoff

**Expected result:** +£42k net revenue from this 6-day window

### Phase 2: Boxing Day Spike (Dec 26)
Separately, spike EUR budget for Boxing Day (independent decision):
- 2024 data: EUR Boxing Day hit 2,929% ROAS
- Additional budget would generate ~£66k incremental revenue from a single day

**Expected result:** +£66k net revenue from Dec 26 alone

## The Math

| Scenario | Current Path | With Phase 1 | With Both Phases |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **P9 Revenue** | £1,023k | £1,065k | **£1,131k** |
| **vs Target** | -£22k | +£20k | **+£86k** |
| **Achievement %** | 97.9% | 101.9% | **108.2%** ✅ |

## Why This Works

✅ **Low risk:** EUR's last order date comes before UK's, so we reverse Dec 18 with no net damage
✅ **Proven:** EUR volume can handle +30% budget increase (631 conversions in Dec 2024, stable costs)
✅ **Reversible:** If anything goes sideways Dec 12-17, we flip budgets back Dec 18 before UK's peak
✅ **Separated decisions:** Phase 1 and Phase 2 are independent — we can adjust Phase 2 based on Phase 1 results
✅ **Risk-managed:** Even if Phase 1 disappoints, Phase 2 Boxing Day spike is still a clean opportunity

## Timeline

| Date | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Dec 11** | Decision | Approval to proceed |
| **Dec 12** | Execute Phase 1 | Reduce UK, increase EUR |
| **Dec 12-17** | Monitor | Daily ROAS checks (target: EUR holds 800%+) |
| **Dec 18** | Reverse Phase 1 | Shift budget back to UK for Last Order Week |
| **Dec 19-25** | Normal run | Standard budget allocation |
| **Dec 26** | Execute Phase 2 | Boxing Day spike if we're confident |

## What I Need

Just confirmation you're comfortable with this approach:
- ✅ Proceed with 10% reallocation (Phase 1) Dec 12-17?
- ✅ Plan for Boxing Day spike (Phase 2) conditional on Phase 1 performance?

If you have any questions about the numbers or want to adjust the approach (e.g., different shift amount, different timing), just let me know.

This could be the difference between finishing P9 2% short of target vs 8% above it.
