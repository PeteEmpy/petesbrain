- 'Me: Hello there.'
- 'Them: Morning. Morning. Sorry I was late. I was on there. I''m on time.'
- 'Me: I''m sorry. One time.'
- 'Them: Late. No, it''s just trying to avios offer up with ba quick. It''s one of
  them. Whereas if I forget it, you''re not going to.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Answer.'
- 'Me: There''s a friend of mine absolutely obsessed with Aleos. But he''s a british
  aries gold card member. And he''s just like, He just lives it. You know, he''ll
  actually go on a trip just to get keep his gold card status. Yeah, I just bought
  it. Off to Sweden or something for the weekend, just to keep his Gold Card status.'
- 'Them: Nice.'
- 'Me: Rob. Hello.'
- 'Them: On the same with nectar points.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: How are you?'
- 'Me: What do you do with him?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So it pretty much pays for all the Christmas shops.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So I accumulated. I''ve got a Nectar Dynamics. That''s a Nectar one, so you
  just get your two for one, two points for a pound. And then so we''ve got, like,
  200 quid.'
- 'Me: All right.'
- 'Them: So when we host for Christmas, it pretty much covers that. So it''s what?
  It''s worth it in that way.'
- 'Me: We''ve got the Tesco Club card, but the thing with that is we just go. Yeah,
  I''ll have the money then. It''s going to sound really Pontius. We just give it
  away. We actually give it to the Trussell shots. We go and buy some food from Jasper
  and take it down there because you think, well. It''s not really my money. But then
  another year we went and got did the chuck paper the channel tunnel on. It. And
  it was so much cheaper. Incredible. I can never be asked.'
- 'Them: It''s good value. It''s good value. So we go out dinner on the Pizza Express
  four or five times a year. Pay about 10 on this brand year market. So pay for the
  four of us. Sometimes they let me do it on food and drink.'
- 'Me: Right, okay. Really? Nice.'
- 'Them: S the table once for. Yeah, but again, if this last time we went four of
  us, and that''s like, eat as much as you can. Worked out about 13 quid in cash.
  You had to pay.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: Right. That''s pretty good.'
- 'Me: I looked that one up.'
- 'Them: I agree. Okay? Everything, man. So I''ll look into whether we strip out the
  men allow.'
- 'Me: Co. Ol? Hi, lauren. Happy black Friday. Yeah, good. Thanks. Yeah, good. I''m
  glad. I''ve sorted the promotions out, that''s for sure.'
- 'Them: Me? Yeah. Think we''re sorting that out. I did want to spend a majority of
  the school just going through, like, how you''ve set things up. Just so that in
  the future, if I need to troubleshoot anything or handset things up myself, I''m
  very clear on, like, what you''ve done.'
- 'Me: Okay? Yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: Call. No, sorry. Finish. Sorry. I was just going to say. And is everything
  clear of, like, how we can just, like, improve the process going forward? Like,
  just setting things, like, even. Yeah, just make sure there''s no errors and all
  those kinds of things.'
- 'Me: Just. Just to check this, what I''ve done. Just to check this. I was about
  here yesterday. Because I''m. I''ve just got a load of stuff chucked at me. I''m
  trying to get through as quickly as I possibly can. And there was no way to keep
  a track of it at all. That was. That was the problem I had.'
- 'Them: Okay? Well, going forward, we''ll put in. I''ll create a checklist so that
  we can just keep track of everything between us. Just make sure everything''s out
  correctly, because it''s that we just sit up currently the first time, then have
  things live and they''re not correct, and then customers see that.'
- 'Me: Right? Yeah, yeah, no problem. Oh, yeah, I don''t. I mean. There was nothing.
  Incorrect. The customers saw. You know, like, we''ve got to get it in contact a
  little bit. There was nothing that they saw. They were going to go, I''m never going
  to shop at Smythson again. It''s just that on the 17th of November they might not
  have seen the Black Friday offer rather than now they would see. A Black Friday
  offer.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So, yeah, I get it. Yeah, it''s got to be right. But, you know, so we''ve also
  got to have a little bit of context of what. What was being seen. I think it''s
  more whether the business would have seen it. I''ve seen stuff they would have expected
  to see, which is just. As important. I get it. Yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: Because I think so we''ve seen a couple of things and, like, our stationery
  as we''re showing off is that shouldn''t have been. But, yeah, we''ll just put in
  the process going forward. So, yeah, I''m just gonna.'
- 'Me: Why was he on the us. So we saw it on the us.'
- 'Them: No. So I noticed in the US Account that there was, like, notebooks. Notebooks
  had the offer. Alex had seen that there was, like, 20% on notebooks. That personally
  was my fault. Because I didn''t update the copy. And then with the Black Friday
  assets themselves, the. The images hadn''t been updated. So it''s like you''re seeing
  Black Friday text but seeing it with product imagery.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Whatever.'
- 'Them: Just stuff like that. Cool. I will record for everyone''s okay. That. Well,
  I was just going to go through quick. Was there anything that. I''m needed for.
  Otherwise, I''ll jump back into my BO Stuff. If you guys are going through Merchant
  center promos.'
- 'Me: That''s more important to you, mate. That''s fine. That''s fine.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s fine. Alex. I just wanted to confirm with you if you''re happy
  for us to meet the compliments you this wrapping unhinged. Or in position three?
  I wouldn''t put it in. What''s national one or two? Was that specifically for the
  one that''s targeting aspirin. Well, I could have done it across everything, but
  we could. Oh, no, no, no, not across everything. Yeah, no, sorry, not, of course,
  everything. What I was mentioning yesterday, for those in particular headlines,
  was more related to Aspinall and how. What have we got? That. Is that right? A usp?
  Obviously, everything we put in headline should be a usb. But specifically with
  the Investor Time campaign, it''s important that we make sure we call out the points
  of difference between us and them. So we''re going to spend money. We need to make
  sure that people searching for them see a point of difference. Yeah, that makes
  sense. And the main ones are. And then we''ve got the complimentary in that case.
  If it''s just on those ads, we can put it in. Position to the position 14 Black
  Friday. It just means that on those ads they''re not pulling it. People aren''t
  going to see anything else. Except our Black Friday event is here. Complimentary
  gift wrapping. That''s what they''re going to see in the headline because they''ll
  usually just see headband one and two pinned. I think that''s fine, because our
  offer is 20% less than theirs anyway. So we''re not going to win on that. They''re
  offering up to 50% off everything. Ours is only up to 30 on selected.'
- 'Me: Can I. Can I just. Can I just jump in on this old competitor situation we''re
  actually bidding for on competitor terms? I just. I just think it''s a waste of
  time.'
- 'Them: Always. So we just see the.'
- 'Me: I think, and more importantly, a waste of money at the end of the day. You
  know we''re being targeted on a Rowan target. Given a certain amount of money, And
  yet we''re throwing hundreds of pounds away per day trying to. I don''t understand
  it. It''s only because the business doesn''t like it. They''re bidding on it. I
  mean, the big competitors asset group will be targeting them anyway. Effective way.
  I''m pulling out of it quicker rather than just going for straightforward search
  terms.'
- 'Them: Mobile.'
- 'Me: You know, it just seems. It seems crazy spending that money on it when it''s
  not going to give us any sort of return at all. There''s a contradiction in what
  we''re aiming at, you know, really. If the business is insisting on us targeting
  competitors with keywords, then they should apply, assign a separate budget to it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So this is what you''ll get. And then because the world might get up
  here and you''ll get this thing if you just click the image we expect to the portion.
  You understand what you''re saying, Peter, but some of the campaigns are booming
  like the US Both compared to Asset Group and the search. Campaign are both performing.'
- 'Me: Rather than getting us to the existing budget and not get their ass.'
- 'Them: When I look at CPCs when I last checked, they both had a similar CPC, so
  it''s not like husband. And outrageously more on the search campaign. Yes, there
  are some search campaigns that aren''t converting, for example in the uk, but the
  same could be said for the Competitor Asset Group. So they''re essentially both
  doing the same job.'
- 'Me: Ign. Ments. Well, and they are competing against each other, then.'
- 'Them: It''s just that one is not one shown for product. I guess products and ones
  targeting the searches. I think what we need to look at is which one has the cheapest
  cpc.'
- 'Me: The asset group will be targeting search terms as well, won''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I just don''t see any point. I see it as a waste of money.'
- 'Them: I get what you''re saying, but I think we just need to look at what''s converting.
  And if there''s a positive for us, then it''s not necessarily a waste of time. I
  don''t think that if it''s generating convergence for us, Where does the pmax one
  sit? Is that in here as? Yeah. I''ve seen the search one. I mean, that''s spending
  10 times a day, so I''m not. I''ll get that down in future. Yeah. Neither here nor
  there. Okay? Next in some very rare cases. I don''t know. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s just my.'
- 'Them: Spell up. I would love nothing in the image will be there.'
- 'Me: They''re probably not making any money either.'
- 'Them: Very good. On the other way. Some Sevyn. It''s one of them where we charge.
  It''s not there. Five days and then usually he gets an analysis from Lauren, for
  example, to say, look, five days we spent 500 quid. It''s done nothing we recommend
  and we can put it back and that''s. All he wants. That''s all he wants. Here''s
  the ask. Five days a week if it''s a pink waste of time. But that can definitely
  show the data for that. If we carry this on, it is just going to take away from
  the campaigns that do need the budget. So this is the recommendation we turn off.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: It''s not making impacts and it''s moving.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: At least then we''ve done it, and then we''ve kind of reported on the performance
  of it. Yeah. So I showed some of the data yesterday, particularly the contains that
  we''re performing well. I didn''t really have any questions about it. It was meant.
  It''s in a deep dive, Alex, that we didn''t get to go through last week. And more
  breakdown of the computer campaigns and how they''re doing or not doing. But yeah,
  we haven''t had a chance to go through that, so I''ll just send it over. And then
  she has this on saying what we can do. Yeah, that''s perfect. And I mean, just to
  go back to Peter''s point as well, you are right in saying that the ultimate kind
  of thing is ecommerce. Money that you''ve got to spend on mobile. That is the ultimate.
  Are we all two to three of us doing a good job? So, yeah, I think with the competitive
  thing, there''ll be ideas like that as well that won''t even get. Past you guys,
  but this particular one, I think it''s. Try it. Spent probably three in the UK about
  300 quid so far between the PMX asset group and the search. And what they do, run
  it for another day or two, do a wrap up and then I suspect. We''ll have a clear
  answer then. It''s just not doing much for the business. Or it is, yeah. Originally,
  I''d given it more to spend, but because I''ve been seeing it''s not been spending
  well, performing well in terms of converting, I''ve just reduced it to ten pound
  a day. I don''t want it to always bend. Sure. All right, we''ll follow up with that.
  Then towards the end of the week,'
- 'Me: Just. Just another quick one before you go. Just on the. On the actual spend.
  I''ve tweaked the dashboard now, so the dashboard shows. It''s showing the trajectory
  of where we should be on revenue. Against what it was last year as in the the way.
  So there''s a waiting there as as to where we''re sitting in the actual month. So
  it''s looking at revenue. So it''s expecting at the moment, 308,000, and we''re
  on 374, which is great. But the spend is higher than it''s expecting. So the spend
  is at the moment is 76. The expected spend is 55. So, yes, we''re getting more revenue,
  but according to the waiting, we shouldn''t be spending that much money to get that
  revenue, if you get what I mean. So I''m just. I''m just flagging it. That''s all
  that, you know, is. Is to whether to hold back on budget.'
- 'Them: From what I. Can. Yeah. What''s the cable forward?'
- 'Me: And roas decreases. Until a little bit later when the, the, the conversion
  rates are going to be higher. We just change all the asset groups to put new asset
  text in and so on. That needs to bed itself in a little bit.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then increase the revenue. We''re at the beginning of the of the week now.
  Where is it? It''s fake Friday on this Friday, isn''t it? So we might see, looking
  back on historical results, we see an increase round about that time and it might
  be better to do it then rather than now. And if we''re limited by budget, let''s
  keep the ROAS targets as they are. So we''re getting them profitable. The ROAS is
  what, nearly five at the moment? Which is fantastic. You know, that''s exactly where
  we want it to be, but we''re not seeing a slow up yet. In the volume of revenue
  that''s coming in.'
- 'Them: Sure. Peter. I''m seeing something different on my side. So I''m tracking
  things, like, every day. And I can see that. Yeah. We spent 75k almost yesterday.
  And in terms of, like, revenue, we''re at, like, 40.77%, just 39.28 for Google.
  And spins about the same. So we''re like, we''ve got 186k to spend. And by the end
  of this week, we''re trying to get to about 61% of that spend right now at like,
  40%. So I think we''re okay. Like, yes, it''s good to keep on that budget for the.
  For next week. But we''ll still have, like, 40% of the budget left to spend. Next
  week. We share this. When we showed you, like, the revenue targets and we said that
  we have to bridge that gap. It had the budgets on there. So, yeah, I think we''re
  okay. Like, I get what you''re saying about the Roth and not dropping them too soon,
  and. Yeah, I agree. Like, I''ve been holding off. On doing that. Compared to like
  what it said in the strategy record, which was to change it on Friday. Because I''m
  also as much as the historical data I''m looking at what''s happening right now
  as well. And conversion rates aren''t. They were trending downwards until yesterday.
  Yesterday they shut up and so, yeah, I''M not. I don''t want to increase everything.
  I''m just trying to look at, like, has there been a massive increase? In conversion
  rate between the last two weeks. And there''s like, one campaign that''s done that.
  The other campaigns I''m holding off because I want to see what happens over the
  next couple of days and thirds and upward trend.'
- 'Me: Yeah, just. That''s just by helping you with just the fact that when we. When
  we get to Friday, it really will shoot up. And if we''ve got a limited amount of
  money left, we''ve got 110,000 left in the last 13 days of the month away, 50% of
  it is going. To be.'
- 'Them: So yeah.'
- 'Me: From the end of this week onwards, then it''s just keeping our powder dry,
  really. I say just. Just flagging it.'
- 'Them: Thank you.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: What I would. Is there anything else from anyone before we go through the
  matching center bits?'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: Just one bit. It''s probably more of a wrap up thing, but I may as well because
  we''re on the same call. This is probably more of a planning question in hindsight,
  which is always fun. Do you think maybe one for next year as well? Given. In hindsight,
  do you think the way we structured we share structure the campaigns differently,
  Given that for Black Friday we were only ever going to get one graphic. Zero videos.
  Obviously the message is only up to 30% off. Therefore, those three things I''ve
  just mentioned seem to go against achieving a strong or an excellent PMAX campaign.
  So would we have been better initiatives? Something I was thinking about. Last night
  because I''m sad. Would we have been better having maybe one or two people''s campaigns
  as more of a capsule for this and then supplementing the rest of it with RSAs, the
  real thing? This approach was the right way to do it because we pretty much mirrored,
  from what I can see, the Christmas setup slightly different because it''s got a
  lot more assets and creatives and videos. So it''s just a thought to throw? I don''t
  think so. I think what we''ve done is fine because I think it''s good that we''ve
  got the product groups split out and so the audience. Are in the all targeted with
  the same ad. They''re still searching for what they''re searching for and going
  to the right places. I think last year we just had one catch all Black Friday campaign,
  and that''s just going to like, maybe like the generic, like, Black Friday page.
  Whereas at least in the. Even if someone was looking for a notebook, they''re going
  Street to the notebook Black Friday page and going to exactly what they''re looking.
  For or they''re still finding, like, notebook products, for example. Would I? That''s
  a good point. Would an rsa have covered that? Yeah. So we have rsys as well, but
  where you''ve got product as well. You want to have both.'
- 'Me: The the majority. The majority of the revenue, apart from Brown, is going to
  come from shopping. So that''s going to be in the main, is going to be your pmax
  campaigns. I wouldn''t have structured it the way it was, but. Well, the structure
  would have been. Would be the way it was, but I wouldn''t have done the text the
  way it''s been done. The text has been just been blanket bombed with Black Friday
  messaging. Which, whilst it''s going to appeal to people who are looking for Black
  Friday stuff, It''s not necessarily going to appeal to people who weren''t looking
  for Black Friday stuff. We spend a huge amount of our time making asset text relevant.'
- 'Them: Right. You''re saying.'
- 'Me: And if you think on a notebook campaign, you want text, which is about. Not
  about black.'
- 'Them: Yeah. You know?'
- 'Me: Because what it''s going to do, what you want to do, is trying to resonate.
  The advert there they''re looking for is correct. That''s exactly what they''re
  looking for. If you think at the moment, if someone''s looking for a note, they''re
  going to get an advert that says Black Friday deals now on. That''s not what I was
  looking for. I was. Actually looking for an you might actually jeopardize.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that was the simple.'
- 'Me: Because it''s got a massive. But more importantly, the fact that Google are
  actually quality.'
- 'Them: Thing. I''ll say this about. You have access to the industry.'
- 'Me: And saying whether they''re relevant. Or not. If you don''t include. Different.
  Ways of saying. Within. Is going to go down. It''s almost like you put in notebooks.
  And your sort of thing, it''s not relevant.'
- 'Them: Coverage.'
- 'Me: To what? They search you? Change of all the asset text. You may well make the
  campaign. The arts make up. So personally, I think. Just a few Black Friday notebooks.
  Rather funny deals. Now on if Black Cody notebooks in a few places, like three of
  those headline positions and maybe one of two. The description and the long headlines.'
- 'Them: And that''s not.'
- 'Me: Then that.'
- 'Them: Your message.'
- 'Me: Might have been a better approach than just not mentioning notebooks at all.
  He says in a few. He says it in two or three. The actual product.'
- 'Them: I hope.'
- 'Me: Having a black Friday. Asset group. Which had targeting audience, targeting
  towards people who are looking for an offer. Then you would have been using the
  audiences to target. And the messaging and landing them on the Black Friday page,
  because if you look now, it''s going to show Black Friday. No matter what. It doesn''t
  necessarily have to land on a Black Friday page. So that''s what I would have done.'
- 'Them: Okay? Completely good. What you mean, Peter? We''ll repeat. Max Hex. We do
  have, like, free headlines that are, like, up to 20% off notebooks. Or shop. Luxury
  level notebooks. So there''s still a couple of headlines that are or Shopsimizer
  notebooks. There''s still a couple of headlines are tailored to people who are just
  shopping for notebooks. The thing is, when people are searching, if they''re searching
  for a notebook and they see our ad and they don''t know. It''s Black Friday. And
  then they see an Aspen or ad, for example, and they see Black Friday, and it''s
  a notebook. They''re more likely to click Aspen because they know they''re going
  to get that discount with Buyer Notebook. Even though people are still shopping
  up with things, they''re aware that it''s Black Friday and they''re more likely
  to click something that''s going to get them a cheaper deal. So that''s why we''ve
  got both in there. It''s not just like completely smothered with Black Friday, as
  you just get correctly said, we don''t want to be doing that, but that isn''t the
  case here.'
- 'Me: So the shopping ads wouldn''t be affected by that. They will be affected by
  the promotional text. So we''re just thinking about search ads.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The promotion extension would have done that anyway. And putting site links
  in there which are related to Black Friday would have given people the same messaging.
  But the potential then wasn''t in there to disrupt the quality score of the ads
  during this period and the period when we revert all this back again.'
- 'Them: Ok, what do you mean again? We have headlines that are tailored just for
  the product in search as well. So it covers both Search and pmax, where we''ve got,
  like, shops and notebooks, for example, but also the Black Friday headlines.'
- 'Me: Yep. It''s just my. Just my opinion, that''s all.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I agree with you, what you''re saying, but that''s like what has been
  done.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: No, that''s the only bit from me. Yeah. I''ll leave you guys to go through
  the merchants in the promos.'
- 'Me: Okie dokie. See you later, ed.'
- 'Them: Thanks, alex. Appreciate it. Thank you.'
- 'Me: Okay, let me share my screen. This was a pain in the ass.'
- 'Them: Did you have to work late on it? Yesterday. Or this morning.'
- 'Me: It was late in the morning. I swung one of those. You know what? He just gets
  you. And you think I really do just need to box this off. It was a pain. Second.
  Is that the one Motion Center?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Okay, so in Merchant center on the promotions. You have a number of ways in
  which you gran a promotion. So what I did. Well, what I''ve done in the past is
  gone to our promotions here and done it that way. Now, I''ll show you how that works
  in a minute. What I did this time is manage promotion sources, which is that one.
  Because. What we had was we had a spreadsheet and it was almost there. It was almost
  what Google are looking for as far as this promotional feed is concerned. So I amended.
  I created a spreadsheet which has everything in it. It has the promotion name, it
  has the code, it has all the rest of it in there. Start and end date. And then literally
  just load that up. It''s got the ID against each one of them. In fact, I''ll show
  you. It was that one. Okay?'
- 'Them: So this has got the skus in it from the sheet that we had.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Which is that one there. Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Now what I cocked up on, I didn''t realize it was actually a code. So this
  one here, when I first loaded it, said no code. I didn''t realize there was a code
  for it. And then there''s the Redemption code there. So this is the amended version
  of it, which I loaded up afterwards. So I uploaded that. The first time it went
  up. It went up as a Japanese, as a target in Japan. Because even though it''s a
  UK account, it defaults to Japan, of all things, which is in really little, tiny
  writing on it. So I uploaded it. And the main thing with these, with anything you
  do on the promotions, is they take ages for them to actually review. So you upload
  them and it takes hours. And the more times you upload it to correct it, the longer
  it takes in between. So last night, I think I checked about 10 o''clock and then.
  It was about 20 past 1 in the morning when it actually came back to say, no, that''s
  rubbish. So you got to start all over again. So that was the reason for the delay
  in all of it. So I uploaded this. And for the second time and then thought, that''s
  fantastic, that''s actually worked. But then look at what it does is it creates
  a promotion where we were before. Like that one there. This is one of the ones that
  came from the feed. So if we look at that. What he says. Review approved. Skew.
  Review disapproved and final. State disapproved. And when you look at this as a
  promotion, And go on to the next page where it says, It only comes in one product.
  Just load a whole lot up, all the product ids. So that bombed out as well. So what
  I did this morning, I went back. I went old school the way I''ve always done it.
  Which is to create a file like that. I''ll share this with you now, while I think
  so you can take a look at it.'
- 'Them: Thank you.'
- 'Me: So this is kind of more of a two step process where you create a supplemental
  feed, you know, like we''ve done before, creating a supplemental feed.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So this has promotion ID and item id. So the item ID is your unique ID for
  the product. And then this promotion ID will then correspond with the promotion
  that you set up within Merchant center. So I uploaded that as.'
- 'Them: Okay, so the promotion ID is, like,'
- 'Me: Data sources.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, I think I''ve got it. So essentially, going to map the.'
- 'Me: It''ll all slot into place in a second when I show you that other one. So this
  is the Black Friday promotions. As a supplemental feed. So it uploaded that G sheet,
  and basically all it''s doing is for every item ID on there, it''s saying this has
  this promotion id. Yeah. So it''s like Custom Label on Custom Label 2. It''s just
  saying in that instance, it''s a special field called Promotion id. So uploaded
  that, and then I went in to promotions and I actually manually created a promotion
  like this one.'
- 'Them: Meeting.'
- 'Me: So these obviously won''t be grayed out when you first soarks in the United
  Kingdom language English. You create your start and end date. Here.'
- 'Them: Really verified.'
- 'Me: Of when the promotion is going to be. Then you do your incentives, the incentive
  that you can see on here. There''s different sorts. Of incentives that you can have.
  In our case, it was a percentage off.'
- 'Them: On the second.'
- 'Me: And this is the 20% off one because it''s for books. And then on the next page,
  you choose. Which product it''s going to be. So I''ve said I want them all to be
  this promotion id, which is what you set in the supplemental feed. So that''s how
  they tie up. That''s where you tie the product up with the promotion you''ve done.'
- 'Them: Okay, so it will match the item ID in that sheet with the promotion. The
  promotion ID on your page right now.'
- 'Me: Yep. And you can see. Look, it''s just grayed out. There. That''s the promotion
  id. So then you put your code in, and away you go. That''s it. And that appears
  to have worked. I showed you. The. If I do. I don''t know what it''s on all. The.
  Notebooks. It''s on some of them. So you see 20% off there. And it''s got this bit.
  So the headline is still the main price, but he says 136 pound with code. If you
  click on that, it then comes up with what the offer is.'
- 'Them: Beautiful is there right for me, Sue? Is there a way for me to do this so
  that I can practice it without setting it live?'
- 'Me: Well, you could set something to go in the future. The problem is, when you
  go on to set these up, you can say to it, the schedule is the 17th and November
  to 25 to 1st December 2025. But sometimes when you do it that there''s going to
  be a 30% off, but it''s going to be a strike through on the page, as in it will
  show that there is a reduction. If when it tests it, it isn''t there, it''ll go.
  No, that''s disapproved now. But it''s not going to be live until that effective
  date. So sometimes you actually have to set it up on the day when the site has changed,
  when there''s a strike through. I like this. A sale price on just that it gets past
  this point. Which is just bonkers. Absolutely. Box.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But it is what it is. But they''re live. It seems to work. There''s absolutely
  no way you can go into products and add promotion ID as a column in here either.
  There''s nothing in there to modify columns. Yeah. Promotion ID is not on, though.
  Yes. You can''t double check. There were some products that didn''t match on that
  spreadsheet. The promotion, the item ID wasn''t there. But it''s just going to ignore
  those. That''s not an issue.'
- 'Them: I mean, she said.'
- 'Me: There you go.'
- 'Them: Thank you. So with the. Just have a go at it and then, yeah. Hopefully it
  just pulls it with the item IDs. You took them from the column E, the duplicate
  articles. It looks like the same. Okay, cool.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, so you set up.'
- 'Me: I did a bit of a sense check on it to see what was there. And I can''t remember
  how many words, probably about 30 that didn''t actually exist. But say it''s no
  great shapes. In fact, I think if I go back to just show you, If I go to data sources.
  Oh, there you go. 757 not matching. So normally what it says the only offer doesn''t
  exist. It means either 627 products where it didn''t match. I don''t. Know. Why?'
- 'Them: Very much.'
- 'Me: But the beauty of it is that these products here are more likely to get promoted
  by Google now because they''ve got a deal on.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: The. Should see an uplift. In fact, what I might do. I''m curious as to what
  effect this has, so what I''ll do is I''m. Going to track the performance of those
  products over the next week. And see whether it made any difference to their sales
  volume. That would be an interesting test.'
- 'Them: What about that one? Sharing. Of course. Today. Cool. Thank you so much.
  So essentially, you set up the promotion in matching center and then you add in
  the new create your own promotion id, add that into a G sheet with all the item
  IDs, and then add it as a supplemental feed. And then when it runs.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Y. Es. Just make sure that promotion IDS are the same between the two
  of them.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah? Yeah. Cool. And then.'
- 'Me: Yeah, who knows?'
- 'Them: You. Okay, cool. And then. Yeah, add that in a supplemental feed. It runs
  them and it will match everything together.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay. That''s pretty. It seems so simple.'
- 'Me: So simple.'
- 'Them: But it''s not.'
- 'Me: It''s the bane of my life that for years there''s been issues with that. It
  just doesn''t do what you expect it to do, and the visibility is not there. It says
  these aren''t match. Well, which ones aren''t matching? Tell me. It could be so
  easy to do it, but.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So with the ones that aren''t matching at the moment, you said there
  was like 600 and something of them. That''s something that needs to be fixed once
  I can help.'
- 'Me: We need to know which ones they are. Which ones don''t exist that we''re putting
  into the promotional feed. But I don''t exist in merchants. I can do that and run
  it and see which ones they are. Then we see what we can do about it.'
- 'Them: I don''t mind helping. It''ll help me to learn as well.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: Cool. I''m just going to match the center right now. It''s a Black Friday
  promotions 2025. Okay, cool. So I think, yeah, there''s 627 products. But you''d
  need to.'
- 'Me: Download button there.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so that. So it can show you which ones it is.'
- 'Me: Yeah. The great.'
- 'Them: Okay. Yeah. You can see the item ids.'
- 'Me: Thing is, the pressure''s off.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That they are actually live. So it does actually show you the item ID so, 1,
  2, 4.'
- 'Them: So we can put these in so much at Santa and it will show the list of. Products
  that I''ll have in the errors.'
- 'Me: All right. Out of stock. In fact, yes, that doesn''t exist. 1, 2, 4, 1, 7,
  3. Doesn''t exist in the uk.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And so 505. Nine doesn''t exist. Only check. Don''t exist. And in the other
  countries, they''re out of stock. Something that''s going to come in or not, I don''t
  know.'
- 'Them: We do have, usually this one, we have a stock analyst. Then she tells us,
  like, what will be back in stock and when. But I''m assuming that with Feed Optimizer
  will automatically update when things are back in stock. Is that correct? Yeah.
  So I think I should be fine.'
- 'Me: Every day. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: With the item ID on the skew list. I gave you an item ID on Merchant center,
  although it''s not the same.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Sorry. They are the same. They''re not the same.'
- 'Me: No, they are the same. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Oh, okay. That''s fine, then. Oh, so it''s just.'
- 'Me: Well, that''s how I''ve managed to put it in.'
- 'Them: Okay. It''s just that.'
- 'Me: That sheet.'
- 'Them: It''s just that when you submitted it, Google, and it''s on that end. Was
  bugging out and creating issues. Like, yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. No other reason apart from it being Google? And it didn''t like the feed.
  It didn''t like the big feed where it''s setting everything up. Because if you do
  the big feed, it doesn''t mean you need to go through that promotions bit. I actually
  set the promotion. It''ll do the promotion and add the products to it. That''s what
  it''s supposed to do. I''m never, ever going to do it again.'
- 'Them: I would do it.'
- 'Me: I''ll always use the other method. I always set the promotion up first and
  then add the products to it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because what you can do, you can actually cut and paste the IDS into it if
  you wanted to. You don''t necessarily need to use a feed for it.'
- 'Them: Okay, so you can just create the promotion. Create your information ID, add
  it in with item IDs, and then upload.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Okay. I''m gonna get some practice with this and read some more on merchants
  as well. Thank you, Peter.'
- 'Me: Y. Ep. No problem.'
- 'Them: Yeah. If there''s anything else I need to do, I''ll let you know.'
- 'Me: Ok? Can I ask just. If we could just do a simple thing, like a G sheet or something,
  with what your expectation is of me to do. And then I can then update it with a
  completion date.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then at least you know what I''ve done.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah, that sounds good.'
- 'Me: Because it''s like with the images. Because we''re talking one minute about
  the images, next we say, no, I''ll do it. And then it just got confusing.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So if we could do that. Just something. I''m not one for huge amounts of paperwork,
  but I don''t want to be seen to be under delivering.'
- 'Them: It''s the understood. There are no.'
- 'Me: So if we could do it that way, that''d be fantastic.'
- 'Them: Okay. Yeah, that''s fine. Yeah. Usually, like when I ask for as it greets
  to be updated, I just think everything. Like text, images, URLs, everything. But
  I''ll write that down as well.'
- 'Me: Yeah, ok.'
- 'Them: Cool. Thank you so much.'
- 'Me: Cheers. Bye.'

- Me: Hello there.
- Them: Morning. Morning. Sorry I was late. I was on there. I'm on time.
- Me: I'm sorry. One time.
- Them: Late. No, it's just trying to avios offer up with ba quick. It's one of them. Whereas if I forget it, you're not going to.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Answer.
- Me: There's a friend of mine absolutely obsessed with Aleos. But he's a british aries gold card member. And he's just like, He just lives it. You know, he'll actually go on a trip just to get keep his gold card status. Yeah, I just bought it. Off to Sweden or something for the weekend, just to keep his Gold Card status.
- Them: Nice.
- Me: Rob. Hello.
- Them: On the same with nectar points.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: How are you?
- Me: What do you do with him?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So it pretty much pays for all the Christmas shops.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So I accumulated. I've got a Nectar Dynamics. That's a Nectar one, so you just get your two for one, two points for a pound. And then so we've got, like, 200 quid.
- Me: All right.
- Them: So when we host for Christmas, it pretty much covers that. So it's what? It's worth it in that way.
- Me: We've got the Tesco Club card, but the thing with that is we just go. Yeah, I'll have the money then. It's going to sound really Pontius. We just give it away. We actually give it to the Trussell shots. We go and buy some food from Jasper and take it down there because you think, well. It's not really my money. But then another year we went and got did the chuck paper the channel tunnel on. It. And it was so much cheaper. Incredible. I can never be asked.
- Them: It's good value. It's good value. So we go out dinner on the Pizza Express four or five times a year. Pay about 10 on this brand year market. So pay for the four of us. Sometimes they let me do it on food and drink.
- Me: Right, okay. Really? Nice.
- Them: S the table once for. Yeah, but again, if this last time we went four of us, and that's like, eat as much as you can. Worked out about 13 quid in cash. You had to pay.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: Right. That's pretty good.
- Me: I looked that one up.
- Them: I agree. Okay? Everything, man. So I'll look into whether we strip out the men allow.
- Me: Co. Ol? Hi, lauren. Happy black Friday. Yeah, good. Thanks. Yeah, good. I'm glad. I've sorted the promotions out, that's for sure.
- Them: Me? Yeah. Think we're sorting that out. I did want to spend a majority of the school just going through, like, how you've set things up. Just so that in the future, if I need to troubleshoot anything or handset things up myself, I'm very clear on, like, what you've done.
- Me: Okay? Yeah, no problem.
- Them: Call. No, sorry. Finish. Sorry. I was just going to say. And is everything clear of, like, how we can just, like, improve the process going forward? Like, just setting things, like, even. Yeah, just make sure there's no errors and all those kinds of things.
- Me: Just. Just to check this, what I've done. Just to check this. I was about here yesterday. Because I'm. I've just got a load of stuff chucked at me. I'm trying to get through as quickly as I possibly can. And there was no way to keep a track of it at all. That was. That was the problem I had.
- Them: Okay? Well, going forward, we'll put in. I'll create a checklist so that we can just keep track of everything between us. Just make sure everything's out correctly, because it's that we just sit up currently the first time, then have things live and they're not correct, and then customers see that.
- Me: Right? Yeah, yeah, no problem. Oh, yeah, I don't. I mean. There was nothing. Incorrect. The customers saw. You know, like, we've got to get it in contact a little bit. There was nothing that they saw. They were going to go, I'm never going to shop at Smythson again. It's just that on the 17th of November they might not have seen the Black Friday offer rather than now they would see. A Black Friday offer.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So, yeah, I get it. Yeah, it's got to be right. But, you know, so we've also got to have a little bit of context of what. What was being seen. I think it's more whether the business would have seen it. I've seen stuff they would have expected to see, which is just. As important. I get it. Yeah, no problem.
- Them: Because I think so we've seen a couple of things and, like, our stationery as we're showing off is that shouldn't have been. But, yeah, we'll just put in the process going forward. So, yeah, I'm just gonna.
- Me: Why was he on the us. So we saw it on the us.
- Them: No. So I noticed in the US Account that there was, like, notebooks. Notebooks had the offer. Alex had seen that there was, like, 20% on notebooks. That personally was my fault. Because I didn't update the copy. And then with the Black Friday assets themselves, the. The images hadn't been updated. So it's like you're seeing Black Friday text but seeing it with product imagery.
- Me: Yeah. Okay?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Yeah. Whatever.
- Them: Just stuff like that. Cool. I will record for everyone's okay. That. Well, I was just going to go through quick. Was there anything that. I'm needed for. Otherwise, I'll jump back into my BO Stuff. If you guys are going through Merchant center promos.
- Me: That's more important to you, mate. That's fine. That's fine.
- Them: Yeah, that's fine. Alex. I just wanted to confirm with you if you're happy for us to meet the compliments you this wrapping unhinged. Or in position three? I wouldn't put it in. What's national one or two? Was that specifically for the one that's targeting aspirin. Well, I could have done it across everything, but we could. Oh, no, no, no, not across everything. Yeah, no, sorry, not, of course, everything. What I was mentioning yesterday, for those in particular headlines, was more related to Aspinall and how. What have we got? That. Is that right? A usp? Obviously, everything we put in headline should be a usb. But specifically with the Investor Time campaign, it's important that we make sure we call out the points of difference between us and them. So we're going to spend money. We need to make sure that people searching for them see a point of difference. Yeah, that makes sense. And the main ones are. And then we've got the complimentary in that case. If it's just on those ads, we can put it in. Position to the position 14 Black Friday. It just means that on those ads they're not pulling it. People aren't going to see anything else. Except our Black Friday event is here. Complimentary gift wrapping. That's what they're going to see in the headline because they'll usually just see headband one and two pinned. I think that's fine, because our offer is 20% less than theirs anyway. So we're not going to win on that. They're offering up to 50% off everything. Ours is only up to 30 on selected.
- Me: Can I. Can I just. Can I just jump in on this old competitor situation we're actually bidding for on competitor terms? I just. I just think it's a waste of time.
- Them: Always. So we just see the.
- Me: I think, and more importantly, a waste of money at the end of the day. You know we're being targeted on a Rowan target. Given a certain amount of money, And yet we're throwing hundreds of pounds away per day trying to. I don't understand it. It's only because the business doesn't like it. They're bidding on it. I mean, the big competitors asset group will be targeting them anyway. Effective way. I'm pulling out of it quicker rather than just going for straightforward search terms.
- Them: Mobile.
- Me: You know, it just seems. It seems crazy spending that money on it when it's not going to give us any sort of return at all. There's a contradiction in what we're aiming at, you know, really. If the business is insisting on us targeting competitors with keywords, then they should apply, assign a separate budget to it.
- Them: Yeah. So this is what you'll get. And then because the world might get up here and you'll get this thing if you just click the image we expect to the portion. You understand what you're saying, Peter, but some of the campaigns are booming like the US Both compared to Asset Group and the search. Campaign are both performing.
- Me: Rather than getting us to the existing budget and not get their ass.
- Them: When I look at CPCs when I last checked, they both had a similar CPC, so it's not like husband. And outrageously more on the search campaign. Yes, there are some search campaigns that aren't converting, for example in the uk, but the same could be said for the Competitor Asset Group. So they're essentially both doing the same job.
- Me: Ign. Ments. Well, and they are competing against each other, then.
- Them: It's just that one is not one shown for product. I guess products and ones targeting the searches. I think what we need to look at is which one has the cheapest cpc.
- Me: The asset group will be targeting search terms as well, won't it?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I just don't see any point. I see it as a waste of money.
- Them: I get what you're saying, but I think we just need to look at what's converting. And if there's a positive for us, then it's not necessarily a waste of time. I don't think that if it's generating convergence for us, Where does the pmax one sit? Is that in here as? Yeah. I've seen the search one. I mean, that's spending 10 times a day, so I'm not. I'll get that down in future. Yeah. Neither here nor there. Okay? Next in some very rare cases. I don't know. Yeah.
- Me: It's just my.
- Them: Spell up. I would love nothing in the image will be there.
- Me: They're probably not making any money either.
- Them: Very good. On the other way. Some Sevyn. It's one of them where we charge. It's not there. Five days and then usually he gets an analysis from Lauren, for example, to say, look, five days we spent 500 quid. It's done nothing we recommend and we can put it back and that's. All he wants. That's all he wants. Here's the ask. Five days a week if it's a pink waste of time. But that can definitely show the data for that. If we carry this on, it is just going to take away from the campaigns that do need the budget. So this is the recommendation we turn off.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: It's not making impacts and it's moving.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Them: At least then we've done it, and then we've kind of reported on the performance of it. Yeah. So I showed some of the data yesterday, particularly the contains that we're performing well. I didn't really have any questions about it. It was meant. It's in a deep dive, Alex, that we didn't get to go through last week. And more breakdown of the computer campaigns and how they're doing or not doing. But yeah, we haven't had a chance to go through that, so I'll just send it over. And then she has this on saying what we can do. Yeah, that's perfect. And I mean, just to go back to Peter's point as well, you are right in saying that the ultimate kind of thing is ecommerce. Money that you've got to spend on mobile. That is the ultimate. Are we all two to three of us doing a good job? So, yeah, I think with the competitive thing, there'll be ideas like that as well that won't even get. Past you guys, but this particular one, I think it's. Try it. Spent probably three in the UK about 300 quid so far between the PMX asset group and the search. And what they do, run it for another day or two, do a wrap up and then I suspect. We'll have a clear answer then. It's just not doing much for the business. Or it is, yeah. Originally, I'd given it more to spend, but because I've been seeing it's not been spending well, performing well in terms of converting, I've just reduced it to ten pound a day. I don't want it to always bend. Sure. All right, we'll follow up with that. Then towards the end of the week,
- Me: Just. Just another quick one before you go. Just on the. On the actual spend. I've tweaked the dashboard now, so the dashboard shows. It's showing the trajectory of where we should be on revenue. Against what it was last year as in the the way. So there's a waiting there as as to where we're sitting in the actual month. So it's looking at revenue. So it's expecting at the moment, 308,000, and we're on 374, which is great. But the spend is higher than it's expecting. So the spend is at the moment is 76. The expected spend is 55. So, yes, we're getting more revenue, but according to the waiting, we shouldn't be spending that much money to get that revenue, if you get what I mean. So I'm just. I'm just flagging it. That's all that, you know, is. Is to whether to hold back on budget.
- Them: From what I. Can. Yeah. What's the cable forward?
- Me: And roas decreases. Until a little bit later when the, the, the conversion rates are going to be higher. We just change all the asset groups to put new asset text in and so on. That needs to bed itself in a little bit.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And then increase the revenue. We're at the beginning of the of the week now. Where is it? It's fake Friday on this Friday, isn't it? So we might see, looking back on historical results, we see an increase round about that time and it might be better to do it then rather than now. And if we're limited by budget, let's keep the ROAS targets as they are. So we're getting them profitable. The ROAS is what, nearly five at the moment? Which is fantastic. You know, that's exactly where we want it to be, but we're not seeing a slow up yet. In the volume of revenue that's coming in.
- Them: Sure. Peter. I'm seeing something different on my side. So I'm tracking things, like, every day. And I can see that. Yeah. We spent 75k almost yesterday. And in terms of, like, revenue, we're at, like, 40.77%, just 39.28 for Google. And spins about the same. So we're like, we've got 186k to spend. And by the end of this week, we're trying to get to about 61% of that spend right now at like, 40%. So I think we're okay. Like, yes, it's good to keep on that budget for the. For next week. But we'll still have, like, 40% of the budget left to spend. Next week. We share this. When we showed you, like, the revenue targets and we said that we have to bridge that gap. It had the budgets on there. So, yeah, I think we're okay. Like, I get what you're saying about the Roth and not dropping them too soon, and. Yeah, I agree. Like, I've been holding off. On doing that. Compared to like what it said in the strategy record, which was to change it on Friday. Because I'm also as much as the historical data I'm looking at what's happening right now as well. And conversion rates aren't. They were trending downwards until yesterday. Yesterday they shut up and so, yeah, I'M not. I don't want to increase everything. I'm just trying to look at, like, has there been a massive increase? In conversion rate between the last two weeks. And there's like, one campaign that's done that. The other campaigns I'm holding off because I want to see what happens over the next couple of days and thirds and upward trend.
- Me: Yeah, just. That's just by helping you with just the fact that when we. When we get to Friday, it really will shoot up. And if we've got a limited amount of money left, we've got 110,000 left in the last 13 days of the month away, 50% of it is going. To be.
- Them: So yeah.
- Me: From the end of this week onwards, then it's just keeping our powder dry, really. I say just. Just flagging it.
- Them: Thank you.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: What I would. Is there anything else from anyone before we go through the matching center bits?
- Me: No.
- Them: Just one bit. It's probably more of a wrap up thing, but I may as well because we're on the same call. This is probably more of a planning question in hindsight, which is always fun. Do you think maybe one for next year as well? Given. In hindsight, do you think the way we structured we share structure the campaigns differently, Given that for Black Friday we were only ever going to get one graphic. Zero videos. Obviously the message is only up to 30% off. Therefore, those three things I've just mentioned seem to go against achieving a strong or an excellent PMAX campaign. So would we have been better initiatives? Something I was thinking about. Last night because I'm sad. Would we have been better having maybe one or two people's campaigns as more of a capsule for this and then supplementing the rest of it with RSAs, the real thing? This approach was the right way to do it because we pretty much mirrored, from what I can see, the Christmas setup slightly different because it's got a lot more assets and creatives and videos. So it's just a thought to throw? I don't think so. I think what we've done is fine because I think it's good that we've got the product groups split out and so the audience. Are in the all targeted with the same ad. They're still searching for what they're searching for and going to the right places. I think last year we just had one catch all Black Friday campaign, and that's just going to like, maybe like the generic, like, Black Friday page. Whereas at least in the. Even if someone was looking for a notebook, they're going Street to the notebook Black Friday page and going to exactly what they're looking. For or they're still finding, like, notebook products, for example. Would I? That's a good point. Would an rsa have covered that? Yeah. So we have rsys as well, but where you've got product as well. You want to have both.
- Me: The the majority. The majority of the revenue, apart from Brown, is going to come from shopping. So that's going to be in the main, is going to be your pmax campaigns. I wouldn't have structured it the way it was, but. Well, the structure would have been. Would be the way it was, but I wouldn't have done the text the way it's been done. The text has been just been blanket bombed with Black Friday messaging. Which, whilst it's going to appeal to people who are looking for Black Friday stuff, It's not necessarily going to appeal to people who weren't looking for Black Friday stuff. We spend a huge amount of our time making asset text relevant.
- Them: Right. You're saying.
- Me: And if you think on a notebook campaign, you want text, which is about. Not about black.
- Them: Yeah. You know?
- Me: Because what it's going to do, what you want to do, is trying to resonate. The advert there they're looking for is correct. That's exactly what they're looking for. If you think at the moment, if someone's looking for a note, they're going to get an advert that says Black Friday deals now on. That's not what I was looking for. I was. Actually looking for an you might actually jeopardize.
- Them: Yeah, that was the simple.
- Me: Because it's got a massive. But more importantly, the fact that Google are actually quality.
- Them: Thing. I'll say this about. You have access to the industry.
- Me: And saying whether they're relevant. Or not. If you don't include. Different. Ways of saying. Within. Is going to go down. It's almost like you put in notebooks. And your sort of thing, it's not relevant.
- Them: Coverage.
- Me: To what? They search you? Change of all the asset text. You may well make the campaign. The arts make up. So personally, I think. Just a few Black Friday notebooks. Rather funny deals. Now on if Black Cody notebooks in a few places, like three of those headline positions and maybe one of two. The description and the long headlines.
- Them: And that's not.
- Me: Then that.
- Them: Your message.
- Me: Might have been a better approach than just not mentioning notebooks at all. He says in a few. He says it in two or three. The actual product.
- Them: I hope.
- Me: Having a black Friday. Asset group. Which had targeting audience, targeting towards people who are looking for an offer. Then you would have been using the audiences to target. And the messaging and landing them on the Black Friday page, because if you look now, it's going to show Black Friday. No matter what. It doesn't necessarily have to land on a Black Friday page. So that's what I would have done.
- Them: Okay? Completely good. What you mean, Peter? We'll repeat. Max Hex. We do have, like, free headlines that are, like, up to 20% off notebooks. Or shop. Luxury level notebooks. So there's still a couple of headlines that are or Shopsimizer notebooks. There's still a couple of headlines are tailored to people who are just shopping for notebooks. The thing is, when people are searching, if they're searching for a notebook and they see our ad and they don't know. It's Black Friday. And then they see an Aspen or ad, for example, and they see Black Friday, and it's a notebook. They're more likely to click Aspen because they know they're going to get that discount with Buyer Notebook. Even though people are still shopping up with things, they're aware that it's Black Friday and they're more likely to click something that's going to get them a cheaper deal. So that's why we've got both in there. It's not just like completely smothered with Black Friday, as you just get correctly said, we don't want to be doing that, but that isn't the case here.
- Me: So the shopping ads wouldn't be affected by that. They will be affected by the promotional text. So we're just thinking about search ads.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The promotion extension would have done that anyway. And putting site links in there which are related to Black Friday would have given people the same messaging. But the potential then wasn't in there to disrupt the quality score of the ads during this period and the period when we revert all this back again.
- Them: Ok, what do you mean again? We have headlines that are tailored just for the product in search as well. So it covers both Search and pmax, where we've got, like, shops and notebooks, for example, but also the Black Friday headlines.
- Me: Yep. It's just my. Just my opinion, that's all.
- Them: Yeah, I agree with you, what you're saying, but that's like what has been done.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: No, that's the only bit from me. Yeah. I'll leave you guys to go through the merchants in the promos.
- Me: Okie dokie. See you later, ed.
- Them: Thanks, alex. Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Me: Okay, let me share my screen. This was a pain in the ass.
- Them: Did you have to work late on it? Yesterday. Or this morning.
- Me: It was late in the morning. I swung one of those. You know what? He just gets you. And you think I really do just need to box this off. It was a pain. Second. Is that the one Motion Center?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Okay, so in Merchant center on the promotions. You have a number of ways in which you gran a promotion. So what I did. Well, what I've done in the past is gone to our promotions here and done it that way. Now, I'll show you how that works in a minute. What I did this time is manage promotion sources, which is that one. Because. What we had was we had a spreadsheet and it was almost there. It was almost what Google are looking for as far as this promotional feed is concerned. So I amended. I created a spreadsheet which has everything in it. It has the promotion name, it has the code, it has all the rest of it in there. Start and end date. And then literally just load that up. It's got the ID against each one of them. In fact, I'll show you. It was that one. Okay?
- Them: So this has got the skus in it from the sheet that we had.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Which is that one there. Okay?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Now what I cocked up on, I didn't realize it was actually a code. So this one here, when I first loaded it, said no code. I didn't realize there was a code for it. And then there's the Redemption code there. So this is the amended version of it, which I loaded up afterwards. So I uploaded that. The first time it went up. It went up as a Japanese, as a target in Japan. Because even though it's a UK account, it defaults to Japan, of all things, which is in really little, tiny writing on it. So I uploaded it. And the main thing with these, with anything you do on the promotions, is they take ages for them to actually review. So you upload them and it takes hours. And the more times you upload it to correct it, the longer it takes in between. So last night, I think I checked about 10 o'clock and then. It was about 20 past 1 in the morning when it actually came back to say, no, that's rubbish. So you got to start all over again. So that was the reason for the delay in all of it. So I uploaded this. And for the second time and then thought, that's fantastic, that's actually worked. But then look at what it does is it creates a promotion where we were before. Like that one there. This is one of the ones that came from the feed. So if we look at that. What he says. Review approved. Skew. Review disapproved and final. State disapproved. And when you look at this as a promotion, And go on to the next page where it says, It only comes in one product. Just load a whole lot up, all the product ids. So that bombed out as well. So what I did this morning, I went back. I went old school the way I've always done it. Which is to create a file like that. I'll share this with you now, while I think so you can take a look at it.
- Them: Thank you.
- Me: So this is kind of more of a two step process where you create a supplemental feed, you know, like we've done before, creating a supplemental feed.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So this has promotion ID and item id. So the item ID is your unique ID for the product. And then this promotion ID will then correspond with the promotion that you set up within Merchant center. So I uploaded that as.
- Them: Okay, so the promotion ID is, like,
- Me: Data sources.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, I think I've got it. So essentially, going to map the.
- Me: It'll all slot into place in a second when I show you that other one. So this is the Black Friday promotions. As a supplemental feed. So it uploaded that G sheet, and basically all it's doing is for every item ID on there, it's saying this has this promotion id. Yeah. So it's like Custom Label on Custom Label 2. It's just saying in that instance, it's a special field called Promotion id. So uploaded that, and then I went in to promotions and I actually manually created a promotion like this one.
- Them: Meeting.
- Me: So these obviously won't be grayed out when you first soarks in the United Kingdom language English. You create your start and end date. Here.
- Them: Really verified.
- Me: Of when the promotion is going to be. Then you do your incentives, the incentive that you can see on here. There's different sorts. Of incentives that you can have. In our case, it was a percentage off.
- Them: On the second.
- Me: And this is the 20% off one because it's for books. And then on the next page, you choose. Which product it's going to be. So I've said I want them all to be this promotion id, which is what you set in the supplemental feed. So that's how they tie up. That's where you tie the product up with the promotion you've done.
- Them: Okay, so it will match the item ID in that sheet with the promotion. The promotion ID on your page right now.
- Me: Yep. And you can see. Look, it's just grayed out. There. That's the promotion id. So then you put your code in, and away you go. That's it. And that appears to have worked. I showed you. The. If I do. I don't know what it's on all. The. Notebooks. It's on some of them. So you see 20% off there. And it's got this bit. So the headline is still the main price, but he says 136 pound with code. If you click on that, it then comes up with what the offer is.
- Them: Beautiful is there right for me, Sue? Is there a way for me to do this so that I can practice it without setting it live?
- Me: Well, you could set something to go in the future. The problem is, when you go on to set these up, you can say to it, the schedule is the 17th and November to 25 to 1st December 2025. But sometimes when you do it that there's going to be a 30% off, but it's going to be a strike through on the page, as in it will show that there is a reduction. If when it tests it, it isn't there, it'll go. No, that's disapproved now. But it's not going to be live until that effective date. So sometimes you actually have to set it up on the day when the site has changed, when there's a strike through. I like this. A sale price on just that it gets past this point. Which is just bonkers. Absolutely. Box.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But it is what it is. But they're live. It seems to work. There's absolutely no way you can go into products and add promotion ID as a column in here either. There's nothing in there to modify columns. Yeah. Promotion ID is not on, though. Yes. You can't double check. There were some products that didn't match on that spreadsheet. The promotion, the item ID wasn't there. But it's just going to ignore those. That's not an issue.
- Them: I mean, she said.
- Me: There you go.
- Them: Thank you. So with the. Just have a go at it and then, yeah. Hopefully it just pulls it with the item IDs. You took them from the column E, the duplicate articles. It looks like the same. Okay, cool.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay, so you set up.
- Me: I did a bit of a sense check on it to see what was there. And I can't remember how many words, probably about 30 that didn't actually exist. But say it's no great shapes. In fact, I think if I go back to just show you, If I go to data sources. Oh, there you go. 757 not matching. So normally what it says the only offer doesn't exist. It means either 627 products where it didn't match. I don't. Know. Why?
- Them: Very much.
- Me: But the beauty of it is that these products here are more likely to get promoted by Google now because they've got a deal on.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: The. Should see an uplift. In fact, what I might do. I'm curious as to what effect this has, so what I'll do is I'm. Going to track the performance of those products over the next week. And see whether it made any difference to their sales volume. That would be an interesting test.
- Them: What about that one? Sharing. Of course. Today. Cool. Thank you so much. So essentially, you set up the promotion in matching center and then you add in the new create your own promotion id, add that into a G sheet with all the item IDs, and then add it as a supplemental feed. And then when it runs.
- Me: Yeah. Y. Es. Just make sure that promotion IDS are the same between the two of them.
- Them: Oh, yeah? Yeah. Cool. And then.
- Me: Yeah, who knows?
- Them: You. Okay, cool. And then. Yeah, add that in a supplemental feed. It runs them and it will match everything together.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay. That's pretty. It seems so simple.
- Me: So simple.
- Them: But it's not.
- Me: It's the bane of my life that for years there's been issues with that. It just doesn't do what you expect it to do, and the visibility is not there. It says these aren't match. Well, which ones aren't matching? Tell me. It could be so easy to do it, but.
- Them: Yeah. So with the ones that aren't matching at the moment, you said there was like 600 and something of them. That's something that needs to be fixed once I can help.
- Me: We need to know which ones they are. Which ones don't exist that we're putting into the promotional feed. But I don't exist in merchants. I can do that and run it and see which ones they are. Then we see what we can do about it.
- Them: I don't mind helping. It'll help me to learn as well.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: Cool. I'm just going to match the center right now. It's a Black Friday promotions 2025. Okay, cool. So I think, yeah, there's 627 products. But you'd need to.
- Me: Download button there.
- Them: Yeah, so that. So it can show you which ones it is.
- Me: Yeah. The great.
- Them: Okay. Yeah. You can see the item ids.
- Me: Thing is, the pressure's off.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That they are actually live. So it does actually show you the item ID so, 1, 2, 4.
- Them: So we can put these in so much at Santa and it will show the list of. Products that I'll have in the errors.
- Me: All right. Out of stock. In fact, yes, that doesn't exist. 1, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3. Doesn't exist in the uk.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And so 505. Nine doesn't exist. Only check. Don't exist. And in the other countries, they're out of stock. Something that's going to come in or not, I don't know.
- Them: We do have, usually this one, we have a stock analyst. Then she tells us, like, what will be back in stock and when. But I'm assuming that with Feed Optimizer will automatically update when things are back in stock. Is that correct? Yeah. So I think I should be fine.
- Me: Every day. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: With the item ID on the skew list. I gave you an item ID on Merchant center, although it's not the same.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Sorry. They are the same. They're not the same.
- Me: No, they are the same. Yeah.
- Them: Oh, okay. That's fine, then. Oh, so it's just.
- Me: Well, that's how I've managed to put it in.
- Them: Okay. It's just that.
- Me: That sheet.
- Them: It's just that when you submitted it, Google, and it's on that end. Was bugging out and creating issues. Like, yeah.
- Me: Yeah. No other reason apart from it being Google? And it didn't like the feed. It didn't like the big feed where it's setting everything up. Because if you do the big feed, it doesn't mean you need to go through that promotions bit. I actually set the promotion. It'll do the promotion and add the products to it. That's what it's supposed to do. I'm never, ever going to do it again.
- Them: I would do it.
- Me: I'll always use the other method. I always set the promotion up first and then add the products to it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because what you can do, you can actually cut and paste the IDS into it if you wanted to. You don't necessarily need to use a feed for it.
- Them: Okay, so you can just create the promotion. Create your information ID, add it in with item IDs, and then upload.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Okay. I'm gonna get some practice with this and read some more on merchants as well. Thank you, Peter.
- Me: Y. Ep. No problem.
- Them: Yeah. If there's anything else I need to do, I'll let you know.
- Me: Ok? Can I ask just. If we could just do a simple thing, like a G sheet or something, with what your expectation is of me to do. And then I can then update it with a completion date.
- Them: Okay? Yeah.
- Me: And then at least you know what I've done.
- Them: Y. Eah, that sounds good.
- Me: Because it's like with the images. Because we're talking one minute about the images, next we say, no, I'll do it. And then it just got confusing.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So if we could do that. Just something. I'm not one for huge amounts of paperwork, but I don't want to be seen to be under delivering.
- Them: It's the understood. There are no.
- Me: So if we could do it that way, that'd be fantastic.
- Them: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Usually, like when I ask for as it greets to be updated, I just think everything. Like text, images, URLs, everything. But I'll write that down as well.
- Me: Yeah, ok.
- Them: Cool. Thank you so much.
- Me: Cheers. Bye.

## Strategic Decisions

- Hold off on changing ROAS targets until end of week when conversion rates potentially stabilize
- Consider reducing competitive keyword bidding due to low return on investment
- Carefully structure PMAX campaigns with more nuanced asset text and targeting

## Key Learnings

- Blanket Black Friday messaging can potentially reduce ad relevance for specific product searches
- Promotional feeds in Google Merchant Center require careful setup and mapping
- Tracking performance of promoted products can provide valuable insights

Me: Hello there.
Them: Morning. Morning. Sorry I was late. I was on there. I'm on time.
Me: I'm sorry. One time.
Them: Late. No, it's just trying to avios offer up with ba quick. It's one of them. Whereas if I forget it, you're not going to.
Me: Okay?
Them: Answer.
Me: There's a friend of mine absolutely obsessed with Aleos. But he's a british aries gold card member. And he's just like, He just lives it. You know, he'll actually go on a trip just to get keep his gold card status. Yeah, I just bought it. Off to Sweden or something for the weekend, just to keep his Gold Card status.
Them: Nice.
Me: Rob. Hello.
Them: On the same with nectar points.
Me: Okay?
Them: How are you?
Me: What do you do with him?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So it pretty much pays for all the Christmas shops.
Me: Okay?
Them: So I accumulated. I've got a Nectar Dynamics. That's a Nectar one, so you just get your two for one, two points for a pound. And then so we've got, like, 200 quid.
Me: All right.
Them: So when we host for Christmas, it pretty much covers that. So it's what? It's worth it in that way.
Me: We've got the Tesco Club card, but the thing with that is we just go. Yeah, I'll have the money then. It's going to sound really Pontius. We just give it away. We actually give it to the Trussell shots. We go and buy some food from Jasper and take it down there because you think, well. It's not really my money. But then another year we went and got did the chuck paper the channel tunnel on. It. And it was so much cheaper. Incredible. I can never be asked.
Them: It's good value. It's good value. So we go out dinner on the Pizza Express four or five times a year. Pay about 10 on this brand year market. So pay for the four of us. Sometimes they let me do it on food and drink.
Me: Right, okay. Really? Nice.
Them: S the table once for. Yeah, but again, if this last time we went four of us, and that's like, eat as much as you can. Worked out about 13 quid in cash. You had to pay.
Me: Wow.
Them: Right. That's pretty good.
Me: I looked that one up.
Them: I agree. Okay? Everything, man. So I'll look into whether we strip out the men allow.
Me: Co. Ol? Hi, lauren. Happy black Friday. Yeah, good. Thanks. Yeah, good. I'm glad. I've sorted the promotions out, that's for sure.
Them: Me? Yeah. Think we're sorting that out. I did want to spend a majority of the school just going through, like, how you've set things up. Just so that in the future, if I need to troubleshoot anything or handset things up myself, I'm very clear on, like, what you've done.
Me: Okay? Yeah, no problem.
Them: Call. No, sorry. Finish. Sorry. I was just going to say. And is everything clear of, like, how we can just, like, improve the process going forward? Like, just setting things, like, even. Yeah, just make sure there's no errors and all those kinds of things.
Me: Just. Just to check this, what I've done. Just to check this. I was about here yesterday. Because I'm. I've just got a load of stuff chucked at me. I'm trying to get through as quickly as I possibly can. And there was no way to keep a track of it at all. That was. That was the problem I had.
Them: Okay? Well, going forward, we'll put in. I'll create a checklist so that we can just keep track of everything between us. Just make sure everything's out correctly, because it's that we just sit up currently the first time, then have things live and they're not correct, and then customers see that.
Me: Right? Yeah, yeah, no problem. Oh, yeah, I don't. I mean. There was nothing. Incorrect. The customers saw. You know, like, we've got to get it in contact a little bit. There was nothing that they saw. They were going to go, I'm never going to shop at Smythson again. It's just that on the 17th of November they might not have seen the Black Friday offer rather than now they would see. A Black Friday offer.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So, yeah, I get it. Yeah, it's got to be right. But, you know, so we've also got to have a little bit of context of what. What was being seen. I think it's more whether the business would have seen it. I've seen stuff they would have expected to see, which is just. As important. I get it. Yeah, no problem.
Them: Because I think so we've seen a couple of things and, like, our stationery as we're showing off is that shouldn't have been. But, yeah, we'll just put in the process going forward. So, yeah, I'm just gonna.
Me: Why was he on the us. So we saw it on the us.
Them: No. So I noticed in the US Account that there was, like, notebooks. Notebooks had the offer. Alex had seen that there was, like, 20% on notebooks. That personally was my fault. Because I didn't update the copy. And then with the Black Friday assets themselves, the. The images hadn't been updated. So it's like you're seeing Black Friday text but seeing it with product imagery.
Me: Yeah. Okay?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yeah. Whatever.
Them: Just stuff like that. Cool. I will record for everyone's okay. That. Well, I was just going to go through quick. Was there anything that. I'm needed for. Otherwise, I'll jump back into my BO Stuff. If you guys are going through Merchant center promos.
Me: That's more important to you, mate. That's fine. That's fine.
Them: Yeah, that's fine. Alex. I just wanted to confirm with you if you're happy for us to meet the compliments you this wrapping unhinged. Or in position three? I wouldn't put it in. What's national one or two? Was that specifically for the one that's targeting aspirin. Well, I could have done it across everything, but we could. Oh, no, no, no, not across everything. Yeah, no, sorry, not, of course, everything. What I was mentioning yesterday, for those in particular headlines, was more related to Aspinall and how. What have we got? That. Is that right? A usp? Obviously, everything we put in headline should be a usb. But specifically with the Investor Time campaign, it's important that we make sure we call out the points of difference between us and them. So we're going to spend money. We need to make sure that people searching for them see a point of difference. Yeah, that makes sense. And the main ones are. And then we've got the complimentary in that case. If it's just on those ads, we can put it in. Position to the position 14 Black Friday. It just means that on those ads they're not pulling it. People aren't going to see anything else. Except our Black Friday event is here. Complimentary gift wrapping. That's what they're going to see in the headline because they'll usually just see headband one and two pinned. I think that's fine, because our offer is 20% less than theirs anyway. So we're not going to win on that. They're offering up to 50% off everything. Ours is only up to 30 on selected.
Me: Can I. Can I just. Can I just jump in on this old competitor situation we're actually bidding for on competitor terms? I just. I just think it's a waste of time.
Them: Always. So we just see the.
Me: I think, and more importantly, a waste of money at the end of the day. You know we're being targeted on a Rowan target. Given a certain amount of money, And yet we're throwing hundreds of pounds away per day trying to. I don't understand it. It's only because the business doesn't like it. They're bidding on it. I mean, the big competitors asset group will be targeting them anyway. Effective way. I'm pulling out of it quicker rather than just going for straightforward search terms.
Them: Mobile.
Me: You know, it just seems. It seems crazy spending that money on it when it's not going to give us any sort of return at all. There's a contradiction in what we're aiming at, you know, really. If the business is insisting on us targeting competitors with keywords, then they should apply, assign a separate budget to it.
Them: Yeah. So this is what you'll get. And then because the world might get up here and you'll get this thing if you just click the image we expect to the portion. You understand what you're saying, Peter, but some of the campaigns are booming like the US Both compared to Asset Group and the search. Campaign are both performing.
Me: Rather than getting us to the existing budget and not get their ass.
Them: When I look at CPCs when I last checked, they both had a similar CPC, so it's not like husband. And outrageously more on the search campaign. Yes, there are some search campaigns that aren't converting, for example in the uk, but the same could be said for the Competitor Asset Group. So they're essentially both doing the same job.
Me: Ign. Ments. Well, and they are competing against each other, then.
Them: It's just that one is not one shown for product. I guess products and ones targeting the searches. I think what we need to look at is which one has the cheapest cpc.
Me: The asset group will be targeting search terms as well, won't it?
Them: Yeah.
Me: I just don't see any point. I see it as a waste of money.
Them: I get what you're saying, but I think we just need to look at what's converting. And if there's a positive for us, then it's not necessarily a waste of time. I don't think that if it's generating convergence for us, Where does the pmax one sit? Is that in here as? Yeah. I've seen the search one. I mean, that's spending 10 times a day, so I'm not. I'll get that down in future. Yeah. Neither here nor there. Okay? Next in some very rare cases. I don't know. Yeah.
Me: It's just my.
Them: Spell up. I would love nothing in the image will be there.
Me: They're probably not making any money either.
Them: Very good. On the other way. Some Sevyn. It's one of them where we charge. It's not there. Five days and then usually he gets an analysis from Lauren, for example, to say, look, five days we spent 500 quid. It's done nothing we recommend and we can put it back and that's. All he wants. That's all he wants. Here's the ask. Five days a week if it's a pink waste of time. But that can definitely show the data for that. If we carry this on, it is just going to take away from the campaigns that do need the budget. So this is the recommendation we turn off.
Me: Okay?
Them: It's not making impacts and it's moving.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Them: At least then we've done it, and then we've kind of reported on the performance of it. Yeah. So I showed some of the data yesterday, particularly the contains that we're performing well. I didn't really have any questions about it. It was meant. It's in a deep dive, Alex, that we didn't get to go through last week. And more breakdown of the computer campaigns and how they're doing or not doing. But yeah, we haven't had a chance to go through that, so I'll just send it over. And then she has this on saying what we can do. Yeah, that's perfect. And I mean, just to go back to Peter's point as well, you are right in saying that the ultimate kind of thing is ecommerce. Money that you've got to spend on mobile. That is the ultimate. Are we all two to three of us doing a good job? So, yeah, I think with the competitive thing, there'll be ideas like that as well that won't even get. Past you guys, but this particular one, I think it's. Try it. Spent probably three in the UK about 300 quid so far between the PMX asset group and the search. And what they do, run it for another day or two, do a wrap up and then I suspect. We'll have a clear answer then. It's just not doing much for the business. Or it is, yeah. Originally, I'd given it more to spend, but because I've been seeing it's not been spending well, performing well in terms of converting, I've just reduced it to ten pound a day. I don't want it to always bend. Sure. All right, we'll follow up with that. Then towards the end of the week,
Me: Just. Just another quick one before you go. Just on the. On the actual spend. I've tweaked the dashboard now, so the dashboard shows. It's showing the trajectory of where we should be on revenue. Against what it was last year as in the the way. So there's a waiting there as as to where we're sitting in the actual month. So it's looking at revenue. So it's expecting at the moment, 308,000, and we're on 374, which is great. But the spend is higher than it's expecting. So the spend is at the moment is 76. The expected spend is 55. So, yes, we're getting more revenue, but according to the waiting, we shouldn't be spending that much money to get that revenue, if you get what I mean. So I'm just. I'm just flagging it. That's all that, you know, is. Is to whether to hold back on budget.
Them: From what I. Can. Yeah. What's the cable forward?
Me: And roas decreases. Until a little bit later when the, the, the conversion rates are going to be higher. We just change all the asset groups to put new asset text in and so on. That needs to bed itself in a little bit.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And then increase the revenue. We're at the beginning of the of the week now. Where is it? It's fake Friday on this Friday, isn't it? So we might see, looking back on historical results, we see an increase round about that time and it might be better to do it then rather than now. And if we're limited by budget, let's keep the ROAS targets as they are. So we're getting them profitable. The ROAS is what, nearly five at the moment? Which is fantastic. You know, that's exactly where we want it to be, but we're not seeing a slow up yet. In the volume of revenue that's coming in.
Them: Sure. Peter. I'm seeing something different on my side. So I'm tracking things, like, every day. And I can see that. Yeah. We spent 75k almost yesterday. And in terms of, like, revenue, we're at, like, 40.77%, just 39.28 for Google. And spins about the same. So we're like, we've got 186k to spend. And by the end of this week, we're trying to get to about 61% of that spend right now at like, 40%. So I think we're okay. Like, yes, it's good to keep on that budget for the. For next week. But we'll still have, like, 40% of the budget left to spend. Next week. We share this. When we showed you, like, the revenue targets and we said that we have to bridge that gap. It had the budgets on there. So, yeah, I think we're okay. Like, I get what you're saying about the Roth and not dropping them too soon, and. Yeah, I agree. Like, I've been holding off. On doing that. Compared to like what it said in the strategy record, which was to change it on Friday. Because I'm also as much as the historical data I'm looking at what's happening right now as well. And conversion rates aren't. They were trending downwards until yesterday. Yesterday they shut up and so, yeah, I'M not. I don't want to increase everything. I'm just trying to look at, like, has there been a massive increase? In conversion rate between the last two weeks. And there's like, one campaign that's done that. The other campaigns I'm holding off because I want to see what happens over the next couple of days and thirds and upward trend.
Me: Yeah, just. That's just by helping you with just the fact that when we. When we get to Friday, it really will shoot up. And if we've got a limited amount of money left, we've got 110,000 left in the last 13 days of the month away, 50% of it is going. To be.
Them: So yeah.
Me: From the end of this week onwards, then it's just keeping our powder dry, really. I say just. Just flagging it.
Them: Thank you.
Me: Okay?
Them: What I would. Is there anything else from anyone before we go through the matching center bits?
Me: No.
Them: Just one bit. It's probably more of a wrap up thing, but I may as well because we're on the same call. This is probably more of a planning question in hindsight, which is always fun. Do you think maybe one for next year as well? Given. In hindsight, do you think the way we structured we share structure the campaigns differently, Given that for Black Friday we were only ever going to get one graphic. Zero videos. Obviously the message is only up to 30% off. Therefore, those three things I've just mentioned seem to go against achieving a strong or an excellent PMAX campaign. So would we have been better initiatives? Something I was thinking about. Last night because I'm sad. Would we have been better having maybe one or two people's campaigns as more of a capsule for this and then supplementing the rest of it with RSAs, the real thing? This approach was the right way to do it because we pretty much mirrored, from what I can see, the Christmas setup slightly different because it's got a lot more assets and creatives and videos. So it's just a thought to throw? I don't think so. I think what we've done is fine because I think it's good that we've got the product groups split out and so the audience. Are in the all targeted with the same ad. They're still searching for what they're searching for and going to the right places. I think last year we just had one catch all Black Friday campaign, and that's just going to like, maybe like the generic, like, Black Friday page. Whereas at least in the. Even if someone was looking for a notebook, they're going Street to the notebook Black Friday page and going to exactly what they're looking. For or they're still finding, like, notebook products, for example. Would I? That's a good point. Would an rsa have covered that? Yeah. So we have rsys as well, but where you've got product as well. You want to have both.
Me: The the majority. The majority of the revenue, apart from Brown, is going to come from shopping. So that's going to be in the main, is going to be your pmax campaigns. I wouldn't have structured it the way it was, but. Well, the structure would have been. Would be the way it was, but I wouldn't have done the text the way it's been done. The text has been just been blanket bombed with Black Friday messaging. Which, whilst it's going to appeal to people who are looking for Black Friday stuff, It's not necessarily going to appeal to people who weren't looking for Black Friday stuff. We spend a huge amount of our time making asset text relevant.
Them: Right. You're saying.
Me: And if you think on a notebook campaign, you want text, which is about. Not about black.
Them: Yeah. You know?
Me: Because what it's going to do, what you want to do, is trying to resonate. The advert there they're looking for is correct. That's exactly what they're looking for. If you think at the moment, if someone's looking for a note, they're going to get an advert that says Black Friday deals now on. That's not what I was looking for. I was. Actually looking for an you might actually jeopardize.
Them: Yeah, that was the simple.
Me: Because it's got a massive. But more importantly, the fact that Google are actually quality.
Them: Thing. I'll say this about. You have access to the industry.
Me: And saying whether they're relevant. Or not. If you don't include. Different. Ways of saying. Within. Is going to go down. It's almost like you put in notebooks. And your sort of thing, it's not relevant.
Them: Coverage.
Me: To what? They search you? Change of all the asset text. You may well make the campaign. The arts make up. So personally, I think. Just a few Black Friday notebooks. Rather funny deals. Now on if Black Cody notebooks in a few places, like three of those headline positions and maybe one of two. The description and the long headlines.
Them: And that's not.
Me: Then that.
Them: Your message.
Me: Might have been a better approach than just not mentioning notebooks at all. He says in a few. He says it in two or three. The actual product.
Them: I hope.
Me: Having a black Friday. Asset group. Which had targeting audience, targeting towards people who are looking for an offer. Then you would have been using the audiences to target. And the messaging and landing them on the Black Friday page, because if you look now, it's going to show Black Friday. No matter what. It doesn't necessarily have to land on a Black Friday page. So that's what I would have done.
Them: Okay? Completely good. What you mean, Peter? We'll repeat. Max Hex. We do have, like, free headlines that are, like, up to 20% off notebooks. Or shop. Luxury level notebooks. So there's still a couple of headlines that are or Shopsimizer notebooks. There's still a couple of headlines are tailored to people who are just shopping for notebooks. The thing is, when people are searching, if they're searching for a notebook and they see our ad and they don't know. It's Black Friday. And then they see an Aspen or ad, for example, and they see Black Friday, and it's a notebook. They're more likely to click Aspen because they know they're going to get that discount with Buyer Notebook. Even though people are still shopping up with things, they're aware that it's Black Friday and they're more likely to click something that's going to get them a cheaper deal. So that's why we've got both in there. It's not just like completely smothered with Black Friday, as you just get correctly said, we don't want to be doing that, but that isn't the case here.
Me: So the shopping ads wouldn't be affected by that. They will be affected by the promotional text. So we're just thinking about search ads.
Them: Yeah.
Me: The promotion extension would have done that anyway. And putting site links in there which are related to Black Friday would have given people the same messaging. But the potential then wasn't in there to disrupt the quality score of the ads during this period and the period when we revert all this back again.
Them: Ok, what do you mean again? We have headlines that are tailored just for the product in search as well. So it covers both Search and pmax, where we've got, like, shops and notebooks, for example, but also the Black Friday headlines.
Me: Yep. It's just my. Just my opinion, that's all.
Them: Yeah, I agree with you, what you're saying, but that's like what has been done.
Me: Yep.
Them: No, that's the only bit from me. Yeah. I'll leave you guys to go through the merchants in the promos.
Me: Okie dokie. See you later, ed.
Them: Thanks, alex. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Me: Okay, let me share my screen. This was a pain in the ass.
Them: Did you have to work late on it? Yesterday. Or this morning.
Me: It was late in the morning. I swung one of those. You know what? He just gets you. And you think I really do just need to box this off. It was a pain. Second. Is that the one Motion Center?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Okay, so in Merchant center on the promotions. You have a number of ways in which you gran a promotion. So what I did. Well, what I've done in the past is gone to our promotions here and done it that way. Now, I'll show you how that works in a minute. What I did this time is manage promotion sources, which is that one. Because. What we had was we had a spreadsheet and it was almost there. It was almost what Google are looking for as far as this promotional feed is concerned. So I amended. I created a spreadsheet which has everything in it. It has the promotion name, it has the code, it has all the rest of it in there. Start and end date. And then literally just load that up. It's got the ID against each one of them. In fact, I'll show you. It was that one. Okay?
Them: So this has got the skus in it from the sheet that we had.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Which is that one there. Okay?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Now what I cocked up on, I didn't realize it was actually a code. So this one here, when I first loaded it, said no code. I didn't realize there was a code for it. And then there's the Redemption code there. So this is the amended version of it, which I loaded up afterwards. So I uploaded that. The first time it went up. It went up as a Japanese, as a target in Japan. Because even though it's a UK account, it defaults to Japan, of all things, which is in really little, tiny writing on it. So I uploaded it. And the main thing with these, with anything you do on the promotions, is they take ages for them to actually review. So you upload them and it takes hours. And the more times you upload it to correct it, the longer it takes in between. So last night, I think I checked about 10 o'clock and then. It was about 20 past 1 in the morning when it actually came back to say, no, that's rubbish. So you got to start all over again. So that was the reason for the delay in all of it. So I uploaded this. And for the second time and then thought, that's fantastic, that's actually worked. But then look at what it does is it creates a promotion where we were before. Like that one there. This is one of the ones that came from the feed. So if we look at that. What he says. Review approved. Skew. Review disapproved and final. State disapproved. And when you look at this as a promotion, And go on to the next page where it says, It only comes in one product. Just load a whole lot up, all the product ids. So that bombed out as well. So what I did this morning, I went back. I went old school the way I've always done it. Which is to create a file like that. I'll share this with you now, while I think so you can take a look at it.
Them: Thank you.
Me: So this is kind of more of a two step process where you create a supplemental feed, you know, like we've done before, creating a supplemental feed.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So this has promotion ID and item id. So the item ID is your unique ID for the product. And then this promotion ID will then correspond with the promotion that you set up within Merchant center. So I uploaded that as.
Them: Okay, so the promotion ID is, like,
Me: Data sources.
Them: Yeah. Okay, I think I've got it. So essentially, going to map the.
Me: It'll all slot into place in a second when I show you that other one. So this is the Black Friday promotions. As a supplemental feed. So it uploaded that G sheet, and basically all it's doing is for every item ID on there, it's saying this has this promotion id. Yeah. So it's like Custom Label on Custom Label 2. It's just saying in that instance, it's a special field called Promotion id. So uploaded that, and then I went in to promotions and I actually manually created a promotion like this one.
Them: Meeting.
Me: So these obviously won't be grayed out when you first soarks in the United Kingdom language English. You create your start and end date. Here.
Them: Really verified.
Me: Of when the promotion is going to be. Then you do your incentives, the incentive that you can see on here. There's different sorts. Of incentives that you can have. In our case, it was a percentage off.
Them: On the second.
Me: And this is the 20% off one because it's for books. And then on the next page, you choose. Which product it's going to be. So I've said I want them all to be this promotion id, which is what you set in the supplemental feed. So that's how they tie up. That's where you tie the product up with the promotion you've done.
Them: Okay, so it will match the item ID in that sheet with the promotion. The promotion ID on your page right now.
Me: Yep. And you can see. Look, it's just grayed out. There. That's the promotion id. So then you put your code in, and away you go. That's it. And that appears to have worked. I showed you. The. If I do. I don't know what it's on all. The. Notebooks. It's on some of them. So you see 20% off there. And it's got this bit. So the headline is still the main price, but he says 136 pound with code. If you click on that, it then comes up with what the offer is.
Them: Beautiful is there right for me, Sue? Is there a way for me to do this so that I can practice it without setting it live?
Me: Well, you could set something to go in the future. The problem is, when you go on to set these up, you can say to it, the schedule is the 17th and November to 25 to 1st December 2025. But sometimes when you do it that there's going to be a 30% off, but it's going to be a strike through on the page, as in it will show that there is a reduction. If when it tests it, it isn't there, it'll go. No, that's disapproved now. But it's not going to be live until that effective date. So sometimes you actually have to set it up on the day when the site has changed, when there's a strike through. I like this. A sale price on just that it gets past this point. Which is just bonkers. Absolutely. Box.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But it is what it is. But they're live. It seems to work. There's absolutely no way you can go into products and add promotion ID as a column in here either. There's nothing in there to modify columns. Yeah. Promotion ID is not on, though. Yes. You can't double check. There were some products that didn't match on that spreadsheet. The promotion, the item ID wasn't there. But it's just going to ignore those. That's not an issue.
Them: I mean, she said.
Me: There you go.
Them: Thank you. So with the. Just have a go at it and then, yeah. Hopefully it just pulls it with the item IDs. You took them from the column E, the duplicate articles. It looks like the same. Okay, cool.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay, so you set up.
Me: I did a bit of a sense check on it to see what was there. And I can't remember how many words, probably about 30 that didn't actually exist. But say it's no great shapes. In fact, I think if I go back to just show you, If I go to data sources. Oh, there you go. 757 not matching. So normally what it says the only offer doesn't exist. It means either 627 products where it didn't match. I don't. Know. Why?
Them: Very much.
Me: But the beauty of it is that these products here are more likely to get promoted by Google now because they've got a deal on.
Them: Okay?
Me: The. Should see an uplift. In fact, what I might do. I'm curious as to what effect this has, so what I'll do is I'm. Going to track the performance of those products over the next week. And see whether it made any difference to their sales volume. That would be an interesting test.
Them: What about that one? Sharing. Of course. Today. Cool. Thank you so much. So essentially, you set up the promotion in matching center and then you add in the new create your own promotion id, add that into a G sheet with all the item IDs, and then add it as a supplemental feed. And then when it runs.
Me: Yeah. Y. Es. Just make sure that promotion IDS are the same between the two of them.
Them: Oh, yeah? Yeah. Cool. And then.
Me: Yeah, who knows?
Them: You. Okay, cool. And then. Yeah, add that in a supplemental feed. It runs them and it will match everything together.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay. That's pretty. It seems so simple.
Me: So simple.
Them: But it's not.
Me: It's the bane of my life that for years there's been issues with that. It just doesn't do what you expect it to do, and the visibility is not there. It says these aren't match. Well, which ones aren't matching? Tell me. It could be so easy to do it, but.
Them: Yeah. So with the ones that aren't matching at the moment, you said there was like 600 and something of them. That's something that needs to be fixed once I can help.
Me: We need to know which ones they are. Which ones don't exist that we're putting into the promotional feed. But I don't exist in merchants. I can do that and run it and see which ones they are. Then we see what we can do about it.
Them: I don't mind helping. It'll help me to learn as well.
Me: Ok?
Them: Cool. I'm just going to match the center right now. It's a Black Friday promotions 2025. Okay, cool. So I think, yeah, there's 627 products. But you'd need to.
Me: Download button there.
Them: Yeah, so that. So it can show you which ones it is.
Me: Yeah. The great.
Them: Okay. Yeah. You can see the item ids.
Me: Thing is, the pressure's off.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That they are actually live. So it does actually show you the item ID so, 1, 2, 4.
Them: So we can put these in so much at Santa and it will show the list of. Products that I'll have in the errors.
Me: All right. Out of stock. In fact, yes, that doesn't exist. 1, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3. Doesn't exist in the uk.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And so 505. Nine doesn't exist. Only check. Don't exist. And in the other countries, they're out of stock. Something that's going to come in or not, I don't know.
Them: We do have, usually this one, we have a stock analyst. Then she tells us, like, what will be back in stock and when. But I'm assuming that with Feed Optimizer will automatically update when things are back in stock. Is that correct? Yeah. So I think I should be fine.
Me: Every day. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: With the item ID on the skew list. I gave you an item ID on Merchant center, although it's not the same.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Sorry. They are the same. They're not the same.
Me: No, they are the same. Yeah.
Them: Oh, okay. That's fine, then. Oh, so it's just.
Me: Well, that's how I've managed to put it in.
Them: Okay. It's just that.
Me: That sheet.
Them: It's just that when you submitted it, Google, and it's on that end. Was bugging out and creating issues. Like, yeah.
Me: Yeah. No other reason apart from it being Google? And it didn't like the feed. It didn't like the big feed where it's setting everything up. Because if you do the big feed, it doesn't mean you need to go through that promotions bit. I actually set the promotion. It'll do the promotion and add the products to it. That's what it's supposed to do. I'm never, ever going to do it again.
Them: I would do it.
Me: I'll always use the other method. I always set the promotion up first and then add the products to it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because what you can do, you can actually cut and paste the IDS into it if you wanted to. You don't necessarily need to use a feed for it.
Them: Okay, so you can just create the promotion. Create your information ID, add it in with item IDs, and then upload.
Me: Yep.
Them: Okay. I'm gonna get some practice with this and read some more on merchants as well. Thank you, Peter.
Me: Y. Ep. No problem.
Them: Yeah. If there's anything else I need to do, I'll let you know.
Me: Ok? Can I ask just. If we could just do a simple thing, like a G sheet or something, with what your expectation is of me to do. And then I can then update it with a completion date.
Them: Okay? Yeah.
Me: And then at least you know what I've done.
Them: Y. Eah, that sounds good.
Me: Because it's like with the images. Because we're talking one minute about the images, next we say, no, I'll do it. And then it just got confusing.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So if we could do that. Just something. I'm not one for huge amounts of paperwork, but I don't want to be seen to be under delivering.
Them: It's the understood. There are no.
Me: So if we could do it that way, that'd be fantastic.
Them: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Usually, like when I ask for as it greets to be updated, I just think everything. Like text, images, URLs, everything. But I'll write that down as well.
Me: Yeah, ok.
Them: Cool. Thank you so much.
Me: Cheers. Bye.
