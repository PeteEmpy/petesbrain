Meeting Title: Smythson Catch up
Date: Nov 3
Meeting participants: Peter Empson

Transcript:
 
Them: Hello. How are you?  
Me: I'm very well, thank you. I'm doing a new kind of tack on life. Instead of saying, oh, I'm all right, Let's just be positive. It's a good start to a meeting. I'm brilliant, mate. How are you?  
Them: Yeah, I think I'll have to work on it.  
Me: All right.  
Them: I work on my version of that.  
Me: I was away at the weekend. I went to the lakes for the weekend and we were truly off grid for two days. It was bizarre.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: So it's like picking your phone up and you go, why am I doing this? And just trying to find something on your phone that actually works without the Internet. And it's nothing. I'll tell you now, it's nothing. So it was good. We played games, we went to the pub, we talked it. Was just really good.  
Them: Oh, nice. Nice. How long does it take to get out? There.  
Me: It's a couple of hours. It was Delandale, so it's a bit twisty once you get past Ambleside, so it's two hours to get there. Yeah, dodge the weather as well. It was Friday night, blew an absolute hooley, raining and stuff, but we're already in the pub. And then Saturday it did the same as blowing a hooley again, but Saturday we got out and did a six mile walk on Saturday and. Shower here and there, but nothing much.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: Very nice. Very nice.  
Them: Oh, good.  
Me: Like with the lakes. You've got to do it. It's why we got the camper van. You can just say, let's not look at the weather forecast, let's just go. And see what happens.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: When people say it rains. Yeah, but how long did it rain for? Was it 10 minutes? Was it continually for six hours? Invariably, it's just a bit of a shower. Now, if you got a coat, it doesn't really matter. But no, it was worth it. I'm reenergized again for coming back. I've just sent you that invoice back as well, mate. A massive apologies for that. That was me trying to get the invoice thing done as quickly as possible and it didn't quite work.  
Them: No, that's fine. It just means that, you know, at least. I suppose you. The worst thing I could do is kind of just go, oh, yeah, there's the invoice. Just chuck it through.  
Me: Yeah. Yes.  
Them: Because it's the first one because I knew that you needed to do we'd missed a couple of product hero things. That's why particularly check that one because make sure you got that. But no it doesn't matter. It's just doesn't go anywhere. There's only to Be Incept. So I'm not sure.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I've done it as a third. It's a third. We spoke on the 20th and things cracked on on the 23rd. It seems as though he's been full on since then, but if you're happy with that. And that's fine. If you're not sending. Okay, cool.  
Them: Yeah, no, that's fine.  
Me: Mike.  
Them: Yeah, I'm kind of hoping that. It won't need to be as kind of full on. Not that for any other reason other than I'm just thinking proudly how there's a lot of stuff in there for you to be getting on with. You've got other bits as well. So hoping that. Changes in the corrections and stuff. Have been made.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, let me tell you where I'm up to at the moment with this is. I know, I know. I talk a lot about AI. I'm having an epiphany at the moment. And I bought a lot of people about this recently, but we are now at a massive sea change in things, and I've done nothing.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Well, apart from doing account changes, I am full on with doing an AI system. And it's Smartson that's actually driving. Obviously, I'm using it for all my clients, but there's some very specific smites and things, so I created this strategy document.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Using that. And can we get over this thing where you just say, yeah, AI, can you just go and sort that out for me? It's really not that easy. But I got together a document and all the supporting bits and pieces for Smyson, so that going forward, I am just in the process of writing a spreadsheet. That lets us know where we're up to. So at any one time, depends how frequently we want this. But we can check where we're up to and I can make suggestions as to where we change budgets or target roas or whatever. So it's because it's a big old thing, this that we're trying to do. We want to come in on revenue and budget. So that's why I've developed it, so we can actually keep control of it and it's not going to be an all time consuming thing. And we can also, you know, between us, we can discuss it.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So that's where I'm at the moment, just for a bit of fun. Since I started, the ROAS has got on up 22% on the campaigns, which I've made changes on. And that's bearing in mind year on year. Changes to conversion rates. I did that first, but it's a week, so it means absolutely deadly shit. But that's the sort of level that we can do this analysis on and be able to do it very quickly. And if there's any things like I quoted it before, 137 years in business. Well, don't do that. So whenever it creates text in the future, it won't do that. But that's the sort of thing I'm building into it, so baking in all these ideas. And it creates thing called a context file for Smythen. So it then combines that with my context file, which is. Everything about the stuff that I do, all the things I know about Google Ads, all the things that have happened with other customers on Google Ads and either worked or not. It builds me a nice little. It's a self building agency, so that's the route I'm on. I'm going to try not to. You always know when you get an AI document, don't you? Because sometimes they can be really kind of overly detailed and they look like they've been written by machine. I'm trying to get away from that and make it more direct.  
Them: Yeah. Because sometimes it almost formats things too well. It looks like a professional presentation, doesn't it?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Blind me. If someone really that would take a human. Like quite a bit of time.  
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And hoping I'm going to do that, you know, just to, you know, to be able to do quick documents for you that you can use for the powers that be. They do look professional, but it's all the stuff that goes behind it. AI is about context. You know, not one person's AI is not the same as another person's AI. And to that effect, the project is called Pete's Brain. Because that's really what it is. You know, I'm just dumping everything that I know about. I'm putting all my experience into it so that it can tap into it. It's long and arduous to do it, but we should be able to get some decent results at it. And as far as smarter is concerned,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We're going to be able to keep on top of this and know where things are veering off, not just by looking at a budget every month, but also where roas should be and where conversion rate should be. So it gives us other things to aim at.  
Them: No. Okay, that makes sense.  
Me: The trouble is I have is when Lauren says to me, how did you get these product ids? I can't just say to was AI that did it, because it needs context as to how to pull things off, linking merchant centers and Google Ads and so on. So there'd be certain things I'm not going to be able to teach you because it goes into areas that are a little bit beyond the brief.  
Them: No, no, that makes sense. I mean, it's not. A design to. Yeah. Stop. Say it's not course, is it? That you're not trying to put a through by bringing you on is to dedicate with. No, that makes sense.  
Me: No, that's right. Yeah. But things seem to be going okay. We're getting these, I think. I appreciate when you got in touch. And we put things into context where things are. And have the conversation with her about who's going to be doing what. I mean, I got that whole load of stuff on Friday, which unfortunately went a little bit over my head because I didn't get it till Sunday night when I got home. But at least she's doing something with it. That's great.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Just moving things forward. Have you had your meeting with her?  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Try to kind of make it clear, but clear and kind. I suppose that's the. Yeah.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Just to kind of say, you know, these are the bits where I need you to do more. And get more of a grip off and stuff. Yeah. I mean, it kind of, I guess. It remains to be seen on it over the next couple of weeks.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: We see a bit of. A. Bit of a change, but more on her kind of, you know, feeling the responsibility of the account rather than kind of. Diverting to Seb or you, as you know, just do the last thing that one of you guys said rather than for herself coming up with the direction.  
Me: Absolutely. Yeah.  
Them: So, yeah, so we'll see. So I've had that. Had that chat and sent some, like, kind of objectives, if you like. So, well, yeah, we'll see how we go. But, yeah, I think the main thing for this really is just getting all of that Christmas stuff live, isn't it?  
Me: Yes. Yeah, absolutely.  
Them: Selena seeing what. What impact that has.  
Me: It's interesting that the getting rid of the returning and new customers has made a big impact. We've seen an increase in revenue by taking the campaigns away and adjusting the other ones. And the asset groups are starting to work already. So that's very encouraging, I think, as far as the asset groups are concerned. I know Lauren wants a big list in the marketing department. Wants a big list, but why stop? Why? Not just segment this as much as we possibly can as far as the products are concerned and just so that we can put valid content in front of the customers, because we're going to increase CTR and conversion rate by doing that, by giving them the right message if they're looking for a watch role or give them an advert about a watch role, they're more likely to click on it and then land them on the watch role page. So it's an ongoing process, really. I did a prioritized list at the beginning, but there's no reason why that can't continue on. It's almost as though if you sat there and you can't think of something to do, go make an asset group and roll it out. I'm also doing some stuff on looking at Europe and rest of the world. I think the rest of the world.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: There's some possibility there because of the strength of the Myson brands. If we divert the money towards the right places, then we can maximize the potential of those campaigns. And they do seem to convert quite well, because if someone's going to be. If someone's going to order from Egypt or something, they're not going to order a pen, are they? On its own, they're AOV is likely to be quite high. So I'm going to try and segment out into best countries and worst countries and divert the budget towards the best countries and ensure that the spend that we are doing on those is the best it can be. And same with Europe. That's happened in the past, hasn't it with Germany. Putting more money towards Germany than any other countries is just taking a step back and seeing is that still the case or not? Or can we be kicking up some other campaigns because we have that location data available. Let's push it out to more. Is there a desire of the business to do more international stuff?  
Them: There is, ultimately. I mean, separately. I don't care, just. But yeah, salty. There is a yeah for us in the world, whether it's Europe or even the States to grow. That sign of the business. Yeah, there definitely is. But at the minute, he's kind of like, just wants to follow. Follow the wallets at the moment.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: And whether they're coming from Singapore or New York.  
Me: That, isn't it Singapore's.  
Them: We don't care. Yeah.  
Me: Well, I suppose there's a possibility with the states to split it out. By seeing how the individual states are doing, we get more money from New York than we are from anywhere else. In that case, we could actually split out those campaigns into individual states over time and ensure that the money's going the right way. There may be more of a desire to buy in New York than there is in Oklahoma or something.  
Them: Well, we do that on Meta at the minute. So we. If we're gonna target particular audiences, it will be New York.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Primarily. So we know that's where that's. The in terms of like when Caleb said her kind of lead table of the US States. New York, some of the highest ones. So, yeah, we, we do, we do a bit more targeting on meta.  
Me: Ok. Ok. Well, I'll bear that in mind. Now then, going forward. To be able to segment that out a little bit more. If you look at the actual campaigns we've got, They're ok. They are ok. We've got coverage. Of things we've now not doing the new and returning that's making a massive difference. I think this more in depth stuff. Of making sure the money's going the right direction. Is starting to come to the front more because our volumes are increasing. The more volume you've got, the more data you've got to look at to see where we should be pushing the money. And this is a great time of year to be doing it, so whilst there's still some stuff to be done. As far as the campaigns are concerned. There's that background stuff as well. Of budget allocation that needs to be kept an eye on.  
Them: No, no, that makes sense. Let's just make a note about the. The regions, because I think that'll be. I'd like to actually get. I think there's probably three ways of looking at it. Just going back to that for a sec. Because I've got the paid social view. But then I'd be interesting to see. Is it interesting for you to see it from. An actual demand point of view from the website side or purely just where AdWords shows.  
Me: Now? I don't think so. Because what we're doing is we're saying that which states responded to the campaigns that you're actually doing. And how is Google apportioning that out to those states? I think the first step is to look at the data that we've got contained within Google Ads. But going forward, I mean, it wouldn't harm because it's like the products. What I'm doing with the products is trying to say well, look, we've doing this on Google Ads. Sorry. On the website. This particular product is doing really, really well. But on Google Ads, it's doing nothing. Well, why is that? And looking, making sure that we've got a unified set of data that says, well, you're actually missing bits out here. Then why is people not looking at that particular product and go into it in more depth?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I think these sorts of things are the epitome of what AI Is going to help me do. To pinpoint these kind of areas that we could be missing on the website. You saying, well, the red widget is our very best selling product, and I'm going, God, we don't even advertise that. Well, there's a hole there, isn't there?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And actually look at that and see why it is. It might not be the feed. It might be that the blue widget shows more than the red widget. In which case we could possibly just stop the blue widget and do the red widget. Welcome to my head. It kind of steamrolls the whole thing. It's an unstoppable force of how far you can go with this.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: But we've got all this data. We've got all the GA4 data as well.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I can make sure that I look at that as well and see whether it would be nice where you got to the point where you say, well, look, you're selling so many red widgets through SEO. Don't advertise it on paid. Yeah. Two weeks ago, I wouldn't have been even entertained that idea. Because I wouldn't be able to surface the information. But now it's infinitely available. And, yeah, it's like chomping at the bit, just trying to. Trying to get into it as much as possible. I don't have enough screens in front of me to be able to run all these things, so it's just prioritizing the priority number one, make sure the strategy for Christmas works. And there are levers to pull. I don't think the lever, for me, the big picture, I don't think the lever is to pull out whether we've got this image or that image on an ad. But they need to be done. The business. If the business looks at the ads and says, why are we using that one? Then all hell will break loose, won't it? It won't be a case of. Yeah, but only. It's only ever shown once. I don't care. It's the wrong image.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Me: So he's balancing that off as well as the stuff that's going to make a difference to the cash. But we're heading in the right direction. Have I said that already? We're heading in the right direction. I'm recording this, I'm going to go back afterwards and say, how many times did they say we're heading in the right direction? Are you diving into AI quite heavily.  
Them: More than when we spoke a few months ago.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So a bit more. A bit more now. So just more for, like, probably not as much as most people, but more from a research.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Point of view. So rather than me having to trawl through search engine results and articles, I can just. And then. Yes, it's much easier to just search and then refine.  
Me: Have you used chat GPT atlas yet? The new browser.  
Them: No.  
Me: So Chat GPT atlas, you've got to download it and. I don't know, have you got. Have you got Chat GPT subscription at all?  
Them: I just use it. Very well.  
Me: With the free one, you're limited a little bit on how many times you can use it, but basically it's Chat GPT, but it's a browser, and for the sort of stuff you're just talking about, it's very good. Because if you think what you use in Chat GPT for is solving a problem. Whereas Google, you're asking it to bring you a page up, it's got that information on it.  
Them: At a bit.  
Me: So you're quite right. Research, you say? Go and find me. I was looking for a new monitor this morning. Go and find me a monitor similar to the one I've got at the best price, and tell me what cables I need to connect it to this particular computer. I just set it up and leave it. And it just goes too clean off. You can carry on with something else and eventually it will come back with what you're looking for, rather than saying 27 inch monitor, which is where you normally start, isn't it? So it does save you a huge amount of time. Absolutely massive. Yeah, that's good. Once you.  
Them: No, we've done it with cars so that we bought a car. But looking at car model. So, you know. What year. You know, this model versus this model and my priorities. I don't know. Value, then reliability. And then off that model. Which year, and then it tells yourself, you know, like, you know, this particular model had a makeover in 2021, so you're better off buying the 2022 onwards because it's all newer. And stuff. So it's all bits that you don't really. Yeah. And then it'll come up with, like, based on what you said, your priorities, you know, go for 20, 23.  
Me: Right, okay.  
Them: Version of this car with less than 35,000 miles.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So it kind of does, yeah. So for that kind of stuff, Yeah, definitely useful.  
Me: Would it troll through autotrader then? Do you have Auto trader or.  
Them: Yeah. No, I just think. I don't know if it. Not sure if it does, I presume. I don't know. I didn't really check. What? Kind of looks quite like the information it gave me.  
Me: No, I was thinking more from a viewpoint of go and find me the cheapest one.  
Them: Right.  
Me: S so it could actually go and find you that particular company when you're ready.  
Them: Yeah. No, I never got that far down the road of it, so I sort of got, like, all of my filter options, if you like. So this year, this make, this model, this mileage. So enough for me to go on to an auto trader. And select exactly that. And see what comes out, but, yeah, I still think that's a little while off yet.  
Me: Right.  
Them: But that sort of stuff. Yeah, useful.  
Me: Yeah. One thing you find in Claude is you can create projects. So if you had a car project, you could actually write a document beforehand with all your criteria in it and then attach it to that project. So every time you did a search, it would use that document. As your criteria. And you'd be able to save it in there. Once you get into Claude code, it will write back to the document as well, which is all they call the markdown files, which give you the context. But with ChatGPT doesn't do projects or files yet, but I find them really, really useful and people do them for companies. So you could have a document for spices. You could do an HR document, a purchasing document, an invoicing document. And then everybody works in those departments writes a document, and then you upload it into Claude. So whenever you do something within the business, it uses that as context for what you're doing? If you uploaded it with all your marketing information. You could say, write me a new marketing campaign in the style of that one. But this time I want to do this, this, this, or this and this, and then it will come back with the right tone of voice for it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But it's amazing since we last spoke how much it's all moved on, isn't it? Another six months and God it will be. God knows what it will be. I've got a microphone in front of me now. I just talk into my computer all day and he just does voice. It's bizarre. My wife keeps on thinking I'm talking to her. He sadly mistaken. But you can talk at 130, 540 words per minute. You can't type that quickly.  
Them: No, I still haven't got into the talking, into that sort of stuff. Don't do voice search. Okay?  
Me: I wasn't comfortable with it. I'm not anymore. Once you get over that, it increases your productivity quite dramatically.  
Them: Oh, yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, definitely.  
Me: You think of all those spreadsheets and stuff that you're doing? If you could use Claw to write back to those spreadsheets. And keep them updated. You'd save hours. Absolutely. Hours.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: Yeah, it would revolutionize what you're doing. And it's actually not that difficult. Once you wrap your head around it. 's basically Claude code. It's not as complex, just so long as you get the concept of it. You're there, then if you understand what it's trying to do and the way to ask it things. If you don't know how to do something, ask it. If you don't like what the solution it comes back with you say, I don't like that. Try something else. But no, don't get too argumentative, as I do sometimes. You just go, that was shit. And it comes back to, you're quite correct.  
Them: Yeah, I think I'm still a bit hot behind the curve. With that sort of stuff.  
Me: I do. Using it, mate, that's above the curve for most people. Some people. A lot of people don't use it at all. So I wouldn't. Do yourself down at all.  
Them: Okay. Yeah. Okay. There. I think the more you get into stuff, the more you kind of find, actually. It's just. Yeah, it's become a lot more. I'd love to see a thing of. My usage of it.  
Me: Yes. Yeah. And the best thing you can do is think of something you do on a regular basis. Think. Just ask Claude how you could automate that.  
Them: Yeah, that's a good point, actually.  
Me: Yeah. I'll just get it to go and Tuttle off and go and do it. You need something like Claude code when you're doing more. Apparently I write a load of Python scripts and stuff at the moment and use Flask, the app, and I don't know I'm doing it. I use OAUTH. And APIs and MCPs don't really know what they are in total, but I've got the general idea. But I wouldn't. Know how to write one manually. And it's only through asking that it comes back. And if you don't understand something, I don't know what that means, we'll let it break it down even further. And if you get into that idea of it being a conversation and you're saying to it, I'm thinking of doing this. What do you think? How do you think I should go about that and then refine what it's coming back with?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: To what exactly you want to do, you'll end up with a good solution for you. And they say if it's a spreadsheet that you update on a regular basis, that's a great place to start. Really, really great place to start. Google Claude Co can actually read G sheets. I'm not too sure. The Claude Cabinet certainly read docs if you've got a shared docket or read it. It's actually homework, mate.  
Them: No, no, I know. Well, that's the other thing, isn't it? But then sometimes actually it's sounds sad, but sometimes it's worth something I like looking at just outside of actually sat here doing work.  
Me: Yes, yes.  
Them: To be fair.  
Me: Well, you got to build your skills, haven't you?  
Them: Well, yeah. And that's it. I think, especially with this AI Stuff, if you can kind of absorb more and not actually increase the amount of time it takes.  
Me: Yes. Yeah, definitely. Oh, I feel as I'm investing, And then investing time. It's taking me more time to do things at the moment, but I know I can replicate that. You know, I can. I can bang it out quicker next time and quite substantially quicker next time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then that gives you more headspace to go. Ok, well, I'm looking at that. But what, what if I did that? And what if I did that? And how would that benefit that and gives you time to then physically go and do it while it's totally not doing its analysis and working out what your next step is. I don't work for Claude. So I've got a. I've just written a strategy document thing where we can look at the way things are tracking against. Time. It's a bit of a mess at the moment, but I will ping this over to you. And it's got a week by week. Shit. It's got a week by week plan and it tells us where we are on it. It's got some choppy like system on it. So when I've done that, I'll whiz it over to you.  
Them: Perfect. Thank you.  
Me: Try that scary. And then it just takes another bit of worry out for Lauren. I suppose we are actually hitting where we want to be. Because there are a lot of figures in there.  
Them: Yeah, it'll be interesting. How she summarizes it this afternoon in terms of performance and stuff for the last week.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. I tried to say to her. Look, try and. Yeah, by all means. That'd be helpful, actually. But I'll try and say to. You know, it's also about the people you're talking to. Because they don't understand. Phrases like pmax and generics. It's about being clear, but also in a way that they can kind of at least grasp what you're talking about. So we'll see. Kind of What? But, yeah, anything you've got in terms of performance, that'd be really useful. Just context.  
Me: What if I. What if I do a simplified version of the strategy and targeted non technical people? And then do a summary of where we're up to today. I mean, we've not even started yet because it's the 3rd of November. But what if I do. And just as a sample, just a week on weekend analysis of the way in which all the countries are performing. And just do it as a straight AI type summary based upon the information I've uploaded to it to date. So that we can actually see. So it gives some sort of guide here as to why it's supposed to be looking and what language to use in it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Then that might help to put that across to non technical people. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, I think that's it, because it's like, you know, talking in the language. That you would with Google reps and stuff just doesn't work for the person who. Se job is to kind of move products around on the front of the website. I mean, I've got. No, it's not when they don't want to know they're interested, but so I said to her, you know, it's. It's about kind of what can you show as well, so.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, this is as much as kind of presenting as understanding what you're saying to people.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So we'll see. We'll see. But, yeah, anything from your point of view, just to contextualize the numbers, then. And also, I guess it'll be beneficial for me because then I'll be able to see that and then kind of compare to what Lauren's interpretation is as well.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And then just, we can just, you know, then just help her kind of. Actually, if I've seen what your context is and go, well, have you thought actually, well, what about this? Or what about these campaigns or this account, and just see kind of where her head's at and what she's looking at and. What? She's kind of maybe missing to help her. I guess that could be quite useful.  
Me: Okay, no worries. I'll justify the last two weeks of my life, I think then. Please take it.  
Them: Well, hopefully it's not as insane. This week.  
Me: Easy.  
Them: Hopefully it's not as nuts this week. I've got everyone back off holiday now as well.  
Me: All. Right. So you're not doing emails anymore?  
Them: Paid social.  
Me: God. Jesus. Works. There's something that needs analysis doing. Aren't we paid? Social? Does it work? Facebook, yes. Me, no.  
Them: No, exactly. Exactly. It's just throwing money out and.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: We'll see.  
Me: It's joining the dots, isn't it? Joining the arts. Okay?  
Them: Perfect.  
Me: All right, mate?  
Them: Thanks for that, then. You happy for this to stay in 1:00, all right.  
Me: No worries.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. I don't know why I've told you today.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But yeah, if.  
Them: No, no, no, that's fine. I just. Because I didn't put it in when I said I was going to put it in.  
Me: You. That's fine. No.  
Them: Perfect.  
Me: All right. Mate.  
Them: Cool. All right. I'll speak to you in a bit. Thank you.
