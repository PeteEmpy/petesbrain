15% ROAS Reduction Strategy & Optimal Timing Analysis
Historical Q4 2024 Pattern Analysis - Foundation for ROAS Strategy
ð Q4 2024 Historical Analysis - Multi-Regional Seasonal Patterns
Based on historical performance data across all four Smythson regions, Q4 2024 demonstrated significant seasonal uplift patterns that provide the strategic foundation for implementing a coordinated 15% ROAS reduction across markets.
ð¬ð§ Smythson UK - Purchase Action Focus (Clean Growth Pattern)
Q4 2024 Purchase Performance (Google Ads Purchase Only):â¢ Purchase Conversion Rate Growth: 4.54% (Oct) â 5.74% (Nov) â 5.95% (Dec)â¢ Peak Performance: December 2024 with 5.95% Purchase conversion rateâ¢ Q4 vs Q3 Purchase Uplift: +31.0% Purchase conversion rate improvementâ¢ Purchase ROAS Consistency: 6.82 â 10.15 â 9.66 (average 8.88)â¢ Clean Data: Focuses purely on Google Ads Purchase transactions only
Strategic Insight: UK Purchase data shows a strong and reliable seasonal pattern, making it the anchor market for ROAS reduction timing with clean purchase-focused metrics.
ðºð¸ Smythson USA - Purchase Action Focus (Google Ads Purchase Only)
Q4 2024 Purchase Performance (Google Ads Purchase Only):â¢ Purchase Conversion Rate Growth: 2.97% (Oct) â 3.81% (Nov) â 4.35% (Dec)â¢ Peak Performance: December 2024 with 4.35% Purchase conversion rateâ¢ Q4 vs Q3 Purchase Uplift: +22.1% Purchase conversion rate improvementâ¢ ROAS Progression: 3.46 â 4.71 â 7.31 (strong December acceleration)â¢ Clean Data: Focuses purely on Google Ads Purchase transactions only
Strategic Insight: USA demonstrates progressive improvement through Q4, with December being optimal for ROAS reduction.
ðªðº Smythson EUR - Moderate but Profitable Pattern
Q4 2024 Performance:â¢ Conversion Rate: 2.94% (Oct) â 2.17% (Nov) â 2.93% (Dec)â¢ Peak Performance: October/December with ~2.94% conversion rateâ¢ Q4 vs Q3 Uplift: +96.6% conversion rate improvementâ¢ ROAS Stability: 7.02 â 3.67 â 4.35 (October strong, stabilizing in December)
Strategic Insight: EUR shows bookend strength (Oct/Dec), suggesting split ROAS reduction strategy.
ð Smythson ROW - Emerging Pattern (Limited Q4 Data)
Q4 2024 Performance:â¢ Limited December Activity: 0.00% conversion rate in Decemberâ¢ November Peak: 2.57% conversion rateâ¢ Seasonal Volatility: Requires cautious ROAS reduction approach
Strategic Insight: ROW needs conservative ROAS reduction due to performance variability.
ð¯ Key Finding: Optimal 15% ROAS Reduction Timing
Primary Insight: Both UK and USA Purchase data show consistent seasonal growth patterns through Q4, while other regions show varied patterns, validating the seasonal ROAS reduction strategy with UK and USA as the anchor markets using clean purchase-focused metrics.
Timing Recommendation: November 1st coordinated launch based on UK and USA Purchase conversion strength and other regions' patterns, with both markets leading the ROAS reduction strategy.
15% ROAS Reduction Implementation Strategy - Multi-Regional Approach
ð 15% ROAS Reduction Implementation Strategy - All Regions
Strategic Decision: Based on Q4 2024 historical analysis showing measurable seasonal uplifts across three major regions, implementing a coordinated 15% ROAS reduction starting November 1st, 2025, with region-specific adjustments based on each market's optimal performance windows.
