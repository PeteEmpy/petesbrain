>
> **2024**
> - Brand: £189,561 (66.8%) | £16,704 cost | 15,067 clicks | £1.11 CPC | 11.35x ROAS
> - Non-Brand: £94,326 (33.2%) | £25,995 cost | 14,894 clicks | £1.75 CPC | 3.63x ROAS
> - **TOTAL 2024**: £283,888 | £42,699 cost | 29,961 clicks | £1.43 CPC | 6.65x ROAS
>
> **Year over Year Change**
> - Total: +£29,857 (+10.5%) | +£13,807 cost (+32.3%) | +6,662 clicks (+22.2%) | +£0.11 CPC (+7.7%) | -1.10x ROAS (-16.5%)
> - Brand: -£16,494 (-8.7%) | +£8,117 cost (+48.6%) | -1,124 clicks (-7.5%) | +£0.67 CPC (+60.4%) | -4.38x ROAS (-38.6%)
> - Non-Brand: +£46,351 (+49.1%) | +£5,690 cost (+21.9%) | +7,786 clicks (+52.3%) | -£0.35 CPC (-20.0%) | +0.81x ROAS (+22.3%)
>
> **Key Highlights:**
> - ✅ Total revenue +10.5% with +32% cost increase
> - ✅ Non-brand revenue +49.1% - strong growth from £94k to £141k
> - ✅ Non-brand ROAS improved 22% from 3.63x to 4.44x
> - ✅ Brand mix diversified from 66.8% to 55.2% (-11.6pp)
> - ⚠️ Brand revenue declined 8.7% with CPCs up 60% (£1.11 → £1.78)
> - ⚠️ Brand still profitable at 6.97x ROAS but down from 11.35x

**Peter Empson:**
> The non-brand has certainly improved dramatically year-on-year but it's more expensive to get the non-brand than the brand. On top of all this the CPCs on the brand campaigns went up as well. I would suspect that new customer acquisition is a lot better this year than last year but I don't have that kind of data

**Peter Empson:**
> I need to get a strategy implemented today to ensure that we maximise our chances of hitting the target

### Data Verification

**Alex Clarke:**
> Am I okay to take the £283,888 total from the table above for the UK, instead of the £195,176 in the first table

**Peter Empson:**
> Let me double-check. I'm trying to bang these out as quickly as possible. Sorry

**Alex Clarke:**
> We're all good, the second table looks more to what I expected but just wanted to double check before telling the powers that be

**Peter Empson:**
> 💡 This is a silver lining
>
> The account has successfully diversified from 66.8% brand dependency down to 56.2%, with non-brand increasing its efficiency (ROAS from 3.63x to 4.44x)

### 20% off Gifts Promotion - Implementation Discussion

**Alex Clarke:**
> Yep I'll do my best, it's very much hot off the press in the last 15 minutes.
>
> Some further context for 20% off Gifts, we will likely get one creative but unlike Black Friday, we will be able to weave in the headlines, descriptions and Image into the existing Christmas campaigns. No separate asset groups or campaigns necessary, unless of course you'd prefer to

**Alex Clarke:**
> I'm working on the copy here
> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/PAID_MEDIA_AD_COPY

**Alex Clarke:**
> We'll cover it tomorrow, but would you be happy if for the 20% off gifts, I only include the headlines relating to that offer. That way those are the ones that can be added to the existing campaigns
>
> So in theory we just add the new ones rather than replacing everything

**Peter Empson:**
> Let's talk about it tomorrow. I think the most important thing on that is the Merchant Centre promotion which is shown against the shopping ads.

**Peter Empson:**
> I certainly don't want any additional asset groups. I don't think it would benefit at all

**Alex Clarke:**
> No not at all, I agree. I think we just sprinkle this promo into the existing mix
>
> It's still christmas gifting after all, just with 20% off selected styles

**Peter Empson:**
> It'll probably be the Christmas campaigns that get the best benefit out of this because the audiences are targeting people looking for gifts

**Peter Empson:**
> Snap

**Alex Clarke:**
> Yeah perfect

### Black Friday Strategy - Urgent Approval Required

**Peter Empson:**
> I've just sent you the strategy. I could do with you scanning through it because I need to implement it at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning. Starting off with some campaign pauses so the sooner you could give the nod on this the better please

**Alex Clarke:**
> one point to confirm, we will be back to 'Christmas gifting' (Business as usual campaigns) from the morning of the 2nd of December

**Alex Clarke:**
> Happy for you to proceed with the strategy you've outlined

**Peter Empson:**
> Great, thank you and thanks for the confirmation. I'm actually going to start with the pausing of the campaigns tonight. They're poorly performing and it will help shift focus tomorrow onto the better performing campaigns. Let's go!

**Alex Clarke:**
> That's a really easy to digest strategy by the way, thank you!

**Peter Empson:**
> My head's pickled

**Peter Empson:**
> But thanks

**Alex Clarke:**
> It may be little consolation but I am grateful!

**Peter Empson:**
> Not at all. It's good to be appreciated

---

### Last Order Dates Request

**Peter Empson:**
> Just a note for tomorrow I could do with last order dates for all the various regions

**Alex Clarke:**
> No problem, I've got those along with a site link for each if you want it
