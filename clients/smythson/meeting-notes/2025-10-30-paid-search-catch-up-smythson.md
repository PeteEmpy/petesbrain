Transcript:
 
Me: These are the logos for Roksys, which is my company. This is an abbreviation of rock. Systems are okay Systems. It would be good to add this logo and also use this color scheme from the logo. On. All documents. And web pages. Which spreadsheet is this? Go for it. Oh, God. Budding. Can you hear me? Now? Yes. No. You don't hear me? You can hear me. I can't hear you. I'm going to go off and come back again.  
Them: I don't know. Like an email has come through, maybe.  
Me: Am I back in the room?  
Them: Or maybe it's in a business manager. Yeah. Can you hear us?  
Me: Yes. I'm not doing very well with British summertime at the moment. I was up at quarter past five and I've just seen myself the first time this morning on a call, I think. No, it does look like I've been up at Corbus 5. Apologies. Maybe I should use a mirror rather than the camera. Okay? I think there's some confusion here, Lauren. I'd like to sort out. Okay, let me share my screen with you.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I've not explained this particularly well. Apologies. Right. Can you see that? Okay, so this is the PMAX campaign. These are the two new asset groups which I've created. I've had to create new listing groups for the travel bags because there wasn't one already. So I've created this. It doesn't matter, but I've created a supplemental feed for it which puts those products in. I can explain that to you on another day. So what there is in the way I've set these up is I've created them in Ads Editor and then uploaded them into Google Ads. So one of the prerequisites for creating an asset group is there are certain things that need to exist within the asset details, and if I click through on them, they are the headlines. I think you need to do a minimum of five headlines, three each of the long headlines and descriptions. And it needs to have images in there. It won't upload without them. So I don't know what images to put against them. So all I've done is just selected some random images.  
Them: I know.  
Me: They've got nothing to do with notebooks. To put in there so that we can get it into the system up and running. And then what I didn't explain to you is the fact that. I know you have a better contact with marketing than I do. And the whole image thing, that's the bit I struggle with because I don't have that content, that personal communication with those. Would you be okay? Creating these images in this asset group so that I can just churn through the asset groups and create the ones that are necessary. So that's the first question now, where these are actually used. There's a number. There's a number of different places where these images are used. So what I've done is done some analysis this morning on where those are for this particular campaign. So this is really. So you can explain to marketing as well, if they're concerned about it. So, looking at the stats for October for this particular campaign, this is where they appear. Okay, now, Google search. The top 93.9% of the time they appear in Google Search. It's a misnomer. Google actually called, like, Google Search. It's actually shopping. It's the shopping ads. So it doesn't even use these images that I've uploaded in there. It's gonna look at Merchant center and pull the images straight from the product catalog. So we can discount that. We've got that. We've got that boxed off. It's automatically going to do it, but then you can. See out of the spend how little is spelled spent elsewhere. I've just noticed these figures are actually wrong. That should be 0.5%. 20 quid out of that amount is on YouTube, maps, display, network, discovery. It's nothing. The majority of times in PMAX is going to be a shopping ad. So the actually normality of this, I don't know why it's done. 5%. I say that should be 0.5% there. You can see the number of impressions, the number of times it's actually been shown. It's minimal. It really is minimal. So the messaging that is coming across to the customer. This isn't a big thing. It's really not a big thing in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't really matter whether you. Wait. If we put some placeholders in there now, just some pictures of notebooks or travel bags, and then on Monday we can put the correct thing in, they will appear. With a Christmas message unit, be quite happy. But if we stop right now and say, right, we're all going to have to sit back and wait for marketing to do this is going to hold the whole thing up.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And it's going to stop our flow. Does that explain things a little bit better, what I was trying to do?  
Them: I always understood what you were trying to achieve, and I completely did it.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: Shopping feed with the shopping feed, but.  
Me: So. Rry, lauren.  
Them: And no worries.  
Me: It's going to be one of those days. Sorry. The bit I heard was you understood what I was trying to do.  
Them: Yeah, but I'm just concerned about, like, for example, Sam sees these images being served. She's gonna be like, well, these aren't what I approved. I did explain to her. I did show her an example yesterday of. Let me forward you the example I showed her. I was showing her how like the briefcases. It was from your travel bags asset group.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. I showed her an example of that ad and how it would look with the images that are in there at the moment. One of them being this white background image.  
Me: Ok. And that was the thing I was getting across. You don't show them that. We just need to show them some images. Some of these examples with the actual travel bags in just some product images, they are literally just placeholders. This was a moment in time. It's all been dropped in there.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: And I've gone. There's the asset group. I've set the listing group up. It can run 94% of the time. It will actually be showing a shopping ad. Anyway, it's working. We're getting some stats coming in, but we just needed those taken out. Put some pictures of travel bags in there. And then you can show her and go. There you go. That's the ad.  
Them: We all agreed that we ignore marketing for a minute.  
Me: Yes, please.  
Them: Okay? Are we all agreed? That this is the right thing to do. Ignoring, yes, a marketing department. Yes, outside of marketing is the right thing to do. And we're saying that. Whatever these images are. Nine and a half times out of 10, they're gonna show on a shock. Yeah.  
Me: Correct.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We just bought sticking, Alex. That's all we're doing. We're box ticking for Google.  
Them: And. With. Yeah. Yeah, no, I understand. And then we're saying that. Ultimately. For whatever reason, we didn't brief in as a wee. I was on the smart inside. Didn't brief in these asset product images. Whatever. Two weeks ago. Otherwise we would have used them. Okay, fine. Yeah. I think for the sake of.  
Me: We still would have been waiting for them.  
Them: Yeah, either. Yeah. Either way.  
Me: Being realistic. We're not actually talking about creating finely crafted display ads here. That's not what the purpose of this is. If we do the demand gen campaign or a display campaign, you go, yeah, yeah, get that. That's what we want to be showing.  
Them: Yeah. Got it. Y. Eah. And then lawrence. Have you put the benefit of obviously, the rest of for November and December? We brief have we briefed in. What marketing would ultimately like to see. Yeah. So, for Chris. Well, they've given us the Christmas assets and knows I briefed in. I breathed in, like, four times. Vertical four times Landscape, for example, for Christmas. And they've given us a set of, like, product images. Because we only decided last week that we were going to split out by. Product group. It's, like, too late to, like, go back to them and say, oh, we need, like, Christmas assets for this. These, like, 10 different product groups. But luckily, from what they've given us a large selection, so we kind of have that covered already. Yeah. But until from now until Sunday, we don't have anything to cover like autumn winter 25 in those different product groups, essentially, because that should have been briefed in, like, back in August when Autumn Winter 25 went live. Yeah, no, that's fine. I'm not too. Not too worried about that part.  
Me: Can I just make a point here? The ideal situation here, which keeps everybody happy. Is that given where these are displayed and you've got text by the side of them. If we just had generic images force myson they showed even if you had all the products on there. It really does tick the box. Because you could just do. You could do Christmassy type ads. And just display Smythen as a brand, because that's the. That's the function of this, really. You know, if you think when you're on YouTube and you being retargeted to buy one of these ads, it's going to appear and there'd be wording there and the images. Isn't the thing that's selling this. This isn't actually attracting the click, it's the wording. So the wording is relevant.  
Them: Yeah. Absolutely.  
Me: That's far more important, which it is. It's far more important than the actual image being relevant. So if we did a generic, we did a set of generics, we could just say, right, that set of generics, whoosh, in we go. Every asset group we create, we'll use those generic type images, and I presume that's what the Christmas ones are going to be.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, I'm not. For this example, especially when we're talking about a few days if it's the difference between a campaigns being in a better place come Monday, because that's ultimately what we'll give. Josh Long. I'm happy for Sam to kind of just. Not be ignored. But for the purpose of this group, be ignored for a couple of days.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I can share. Like what? Let me show my screen what I do have. We have, like, some briefcases and, like, a kingly tote bag, which isn't really a travel bag, but, oh, well.  
Me: Is it? Back at the end of the day, Lauren.  
Them: Yeah. So this is what we have. This is what we can work with.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, that whole top row is fine.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And that is enough. That's horizontal, square, vertical. Bang them in just those four.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That would be fine for this particular asset group.  
Them: And for notebooks. Are we just going to ignore and then use the pack shots?  
Me: Just use product images.  
Them: Okay? I'll have to. I don't know, Alex. If I can screenshot them from the website or, like, save the image. From the website.  
Me: Yeah, just do that.  
Them: Probably.  
Me: Well, you could actually do it from within the asset group, because you can just use.  
Them: Yes. Where it takes it from the URL.  
Me: Yeah. Can I share my screen?  
Them: Yeah. No worries.  
Me: So I've just bashed on with this, and I'm not really explaining what I've meant by it. So when you edit merchant products. There's every single merchant boat. 8,730 images there.  
Them: Okay? Yeah. Let's use this.  
Me: You could actually just go in and go. Yeah. Product name. Contains notebook. Yeah. I mean, they're not the most exciting images in the world, but if you pick something like the leopard print one is quite bright, a red one, you got 739. 739 rectangles to choose from. But again, it's just ticking. The box.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: For Google. You do actually have some images.  
Them: Yeah, that makes sense.  
Me: And if you saw this on YouTube, a little, tiny little ad on YouTube with a little picture of a brightly colored notebook and then the actual text by the side of it telling you what it is. It does the trick, doesn't it? And that's 0.5% of the time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I think what I'm trying to get across is the amount of time to create that we're spending on doing these images is disproportionate to the number of times it's actually going to be showing. I'm not saying disregard it. I do understand that we have the brand to preserve. But we're doing that by actually using the brand's images. We're not showing. It's not a screenshot I've done of something or an iPhone picture I've taken of someone's bag that I'm throwing up there, which would look rubbish. We're actually showing. We're shown this Smyths and image and it means that I hate. To say it, but we've got, like, seven or eight weeks now to get this running as best as we can. So I'm trying to production line the whole thing.  
Them: That makes sense. Here. Yeah, if that makes sense.  
Me: To get the structure going as quickly as possible, because then we're going to roll it out to the US as well. Once these asset groups are done, copy all that over, make sure all that's ok. So that will be another set of assets that we create, but it should pay off, though.  
Them: Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. All on the same page.  
Me: Cool. Was the report OK for the. Sorry. Is that OK for the assets? You're happy with that?  
Them: Alex's final.  
Me: Yeah. Ok. So as far as the budgets and target roas were, you were happy with that? The last report I sent you, where it breaks it down, tells you exactly what the roas targets I'll need to cut when they need to come down and buy, how much overall?  
Them: Bit. Yeah. So I'll just reopen it again. So, I don't know if you saw my messages, say, but I didn't make any changes. Especially to the budget, because our budget. Because we're trying to split this budget until the 3rd. Yeah, the 3rd of November.  
Me: This is where your skill is going to come in, though.  
Them: Or 2nd of November, so.  
Me: This is where your skills, you know, where you are up to with this. So I'm going to stress it again. This is indicative. This is. At least it gives us some milestones, you know, where we want conversion rate to be, where we want roas to be.  
Them: Yeah. Just ro. Yeah, that makes sense. So, yeah, I didn't make any changes to the budget because it's essentially asking me to increase them. And we want to, you know, keep as much budget as we can for November. So I haven't made any changes there. And then as for roas, from what I checked yesterday for the UK for period, to date. We were at 4.3. So I'm like, just keep it as it is. And then for Europe, we were. Let me just double check again. But I think we were, bro. I think it was like 3.27. I'm just. Check that again. 3.75 now. Yeah. So when it comes to tolerance, I can, like, reduce all of them by 15 cent, is that what you mean?  
Me: Yes, please.  
Them: Okay, cool.  
Me: 15 was it. They were split. I can't remember what it was now, what the recommendation was. I think for the uk. It doesn't all come down in one go, does it?  
Them: Sorry. For Europe. It says target Roth 1.5 baseline.  
Me: Yeah. That's where we are at the moment.  
Them: But.  
Me: So leaving the baseline, just leave it as it is at the moment. And then when we get to those milestones that we actually change, there are us.  
Them: On. Okay? Okay? Sorry, I'm just a bit confused because the Roth is actually higher.  
Me: Yeah, it's just taking it as a baseline at the moment when it says baseline. Don't touch anything.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: If it says bring it down by a percentage, then that's what we're going to do. It is confusing that I agree with you.  
Them: Yeah. Just because, like. Yeah, what's in here is not what I'm seeing on the platform.  
Me: It's fine. Yeah.  
Them: Okay? Cool.  
Me: That report has driven me mad. Absolutely mad to try and get it right, because obviously things have changed all the time when we're working on slightly flawed data from previously. So I think the most important thing is those reductions in roas. And when we do those, I'm going to try and produce some other reporting for you that actually tells us where we are at the moment.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.  
Me: Using BI conversion time as an indicative of where the ROAS is and where it should be. So I'm going to try and put some checks and balances in place for that.  
Them: You. Know. Okay, that's fine.  
Me: But really, it's not really about the 15th of November, when the big changes start to kick in, and that's where the conversion rates start to increase, when it starts to go mad.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: So you're quite right. I mean, it'd be in our favor slightly, anyway. I don't remember when they first did the report. It's going like on this day and at this time, at this day, at this time, they say, I didn't know. That's far too granular. What we want is by week. So when we say we're talking about November the fifteenth or even November the first,  
Them: That's a sad day. Even.  
Me: It doesn't really matter. Yeah, we'll do it on Monday because then we've got more money for when the conversion rate is higher, so it actually work in our favor to do that.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So that's fine. See, on Monday, I will just let you know because there's, like, an action point in there for the usa. So I'll let you know, like, what the Ross is and then can work on it from there.  
Me: Ok, wonderful.  
Them: Cool. Okay? So all agreed. Right. So, Peter, you're going to did us that groups.  
Me: Cool. I'm going to complete. That. I'll let you know when each one's done. I'll let you know when it is. And if you can just jump in, put something in place for the images.  
Them: Cool. Okay. I'm just going to use the merchant center images that you. Yeah, that you've shown us.  
Me: Yeah. And then come round to Monday. Put the Christmas images in there.  
Them: Yeah, we just won't have any videos. Only have. We only have diary video in a backpack video which we can use. I'll also put in the asset library. I'll put together a folder with those images I just showed you the autumn winter ones. And I will work on the ad copy for the BAU campaigns just to enhance those. I've also got some paid social stuff to do today, so, yeah.  
Me: Great stuff. How exciting.  
Them: Christmas. Yeah. And yeah, and just been doing negative SQLs as well. I've just been keeping an eye on any wasteful search for search terms. So yeah, I'll do that yesterday as well. So yeah, all good.  
Me: Brilliant. As I say, I'm going to try and produce as many things, reports and stuff for you as I can that we can track this between us. So that we're on the right target because there are levers we can pull along the way. If it's overperforming, it's underperforming, then there are things that we can do, we know what they are, but it's just when to actually implement. Them.  
Them: Here.  
Me: My priority now is the asset groups. Let's get those up and running. We've consolidated the campaigns, we've taken the new customer returning customer off. So by Monday, Yeah, we'll be good to roll. Really good to roll. I was hoping to get the asset group done a bit quicker than this, but that's fine. Just long as they're done for Monday. That's the priority.  
Them: One question I have again about ad copyright. I know PC. You put in new ad copy for Brad Stationery. If I create new ad copy or. This is a question for Alex and Peter. Is it fine to just implement it without going through marketing? Okay? So we're creating new ad copy, Alex, just to enhance it and make it better and more relevant. But is it fine to just bypass marketing and implement it? Yeah. Providing. Yeah, it's been kind of. It's taken from the website in some degree, which. Should be feasible because anything we're trying to sell through Google Ads. Should be on the website anyway. Therefore, there should be some company that you can take and just tweak.  
Me: Yeah. I'm going to suggest as far as the asset groups are concerned. When I've finished the asset groups, I'll do a spreadsheet. I'll drop it all into spreadsheets. At least they can say they've seen it. And if there's anything cloud like the 137 years thing.  
Them: Yeah. That's important.  
Me: Can you change that? Or there's something glaringly not right with the as far as the brand is concerned. But I mean, the way I'm doing this is literally looking point of the AI at the site. Sticking a load of other criteria into it. And using that to generate some suggestions for the headlines and descriptions. So at least he's taking that into consideration.  
Them: Keep it uniform and maybe I'll just, like, copy over the ads. That ad copy from the asset groups into the search campaigns, rather than being like,  
Me: Yep. Yeah, why not?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We'll save you time as well.  
Them: Yeah. That's fine.  
Me: Winter is coming.  
Them: Y. Eah.  
Me: It was bloody cold at 6 o'clock this morning. Going for a walk.  
Them: It's really cl. Oud a dark all the time.  
Me: Yes. Yeah, I've saw the sunrise this morning. That's the only advantage of the clocks going. The clock's going back is actually saw the sunrise. Is that an advantage? I don't know.  
Them: It is. It's nice to wake up with something.  
Me: Take a photo of it and show me later. Ok? Are we happy?  
Them: Yes. Okay.  
Me: Wonderful. Ok, guys.  
Them: Cheers. Thank you. Thank you.
