- 'Them: 18 1. Which is 145 of which is the old Google budget. Plus 39 of new. So
  if you''ve got one seven one, that''s 10 of our 12 sorted. There.'
- 'Me: Okay? Well, November. I''ve always had 1, 8, 6.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s what I''ve got. Hang on, I''ve got 186051 for P8 third, two
  or 30th.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: For the 1st till the 20eigth of December. P9 I''ve got 1-80963.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay. I''ve got 1-83929, but it''s pretty nice. It''s three grand, isn''t
  it?'
- 'Them: Well, I''ll tell you what I know. Why that''s three grand is because I approximate
  your cost into that. So I''ve got 1, 8, 3. But I just take off. Portion. Three grand,
  for example, just to make sure that your costs is accounted for.'
- 'Me: Oh, I see. Okay?'
- 'Them: Something. If you work to 180. And then we''ve just got. Well, if you work
  to 181. For google.'
- 'Me: And you start taking Nick into consideration. The overspend for P8.'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So if we take. How much did we ever spend? 12 and up.'
- 'Me: 12. I think it was 11 summit.'
- 'Them: So we''ve got one. Six, eight, nine, six, three. Now we could. Pause. Bing.
  Because that''s three grand.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: And put that three back in to Google instead. If you think that''s.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Do that.'
- 'Me: It''s more likely to be controlled.'
- 'Them: Well, let''s do that then. So Bing becomes. Zero.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: For P9. So we''ll just pause all that, Just keeps it simple.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: And that means that Google for PD9 becomes 171963, so 17 2.'
- 'Me: Right. I''m back where I was then, right? Okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So that means we''re taking a 12 overspend. We''re taking 9 off Google
  and 3 off thing.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah. Okay? So that doesn''t so where where we are then with. So I''ve got
  total spend 171 in the in the projection.'
- 'Them: Cool. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So we''ll come in on budget revenue of 809,9500. So that''s with a an optimistic
  budget, an optimistic ROAS of 4.73. The only way. The only way we could hit. The.
  Expected revenue is by increasing roas to 6.56.'
- 'Them: Well, I think it''s a month of two halves, isn''t it?'
- 'Me: Wow. What I''ve got is seven days. Seven days of cyber week. So this is looking
  at conversion rates from last year.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Then mid December. Plus the diaries. For seven days. Potentially, then four
  days, where at that point that Europe and the rest of the world stop. I need to
  put that final little bit in. We got three days of the finishing off for the US.
  And then Christmas, four days. Boxing Day. Three days of Boxing Day up to Boxing
  day and the 26, 27, 28th. So I''ve got a. I''ve got a budget in there for those
  that varies. So the next seven days I got eight and a half grands.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Mid December go to nine and a half grand, because that''s when we''re likely
  to get the best. Return. Mid month eigth of the 14th. And then, as I say, Europe
  and possibly rest of the world stop, and we can allocate some of the budget. To
  the the other campaigns, but there''s not a great deal left then. So. Yes, it is.
  It is very much of two halves. We''ve got probably 14, 15, maybe 15 days. And then
  it kicks off again after Boxing Day. Very low level. Now, this is. These projections.
  I. I''ll give you a. I''ll give you a final version of this one. I know what the
  last order dates are. Because it''s almost like Europe and rest of world just. Just
  stop them. Just, you know, people want this for Christmas. What''s the point in
  spending everything on them?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I. I don''t want to completely pause them, but I would just drop the budgets
  down to as low, as low as I could, just as a marker so that they do actually start
  again in the new year. But I''ll be able to give you some. I''d be able to give
  you a better idea once I know when those last order dates. Are.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''m just painting them in our chat now. I just needed confirmation.'
- 'Me: Nice.'
- 'Them: So you have 16th, 16th, 17th and 21st. I''d ignore the click and collect
  one. Because not really sounding relevant for local.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: People to slow.'
- 'Me: Just bear with me while I just paste this into.'
- 'Them: So we probably want, which I''ll. Happy to add in close to the time. Adding
  some site links, I suspect just drop them in to say order by.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: But I can drop those in. To your sheet for you.'
- 'Me: Ep. Sure.'
- 'Them: To outline.'
- 'Me: Not a notch. Not in the sheet that''s still got the acid text in. That''s just
  aspect. If you put anything else in there.'
- 'Them: Oh, okay. I just put them in the account. Then.'
- 'Me: Just. Just ping them over to me, that''s fine.'
- 'Them: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Me: No. Well, I know what they are. I can put. I can stick those in. Yeah, that''s
  not a problem.'
- 'Them: Okay. Yeah, fine. Yeah. So I think we can probably put them.'
- 'Me: That''s not.'
- 'Them: In? Well, whenever, really. I guess. Couldn''t we? Because we''re in the
  cinema.'
- 'Me: I can''t. I can. Yeah, I can schedule them in. That''s not a problem.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, let''s get. Yeah, let''s get them in after tomorrow. So this
  week, I guess. One quick question. I was just doing some analysis on the performance.
  In google glance. Insights and reports. Search terms.'
- 'Me: Any particular account.'
- 'Them: No. Whichever one you fancy. I''m in the UK at the minute.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I''ll just share as well so you can see where I''m running around. So I just
  want to look at non brand terms, performance of non brand terms for the last week.
  So I''ve put a filter on. Says campaign name does not contain brand. Date filters
  last seven days, and then it gives me this search term report. Obviously this brand
  times in there. But is this a fair way of analyzing. What terms? Are doing better
  than others. So, for example, best notebooks.'
- 'Me: Well, it depends what you what you''re going to use it for.'
- 'Them: It''s just an update to say, because obviously, when I''m looking at. Traffic.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Non brand traffic in the UK for paid search was up on the year. So you see
  this highlighted row? Non brand Traffic is up 52%.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: I''m not trying to explain all of that 52%. I''m just trying to give a flavor
  of what were some of the better performing. Non brand. Terms that we picked up for
  last week.'
- 'Me: The Oxy question is. Probably. Let me just. Yes. Yes is the answer.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It won''t give you everything, but if you just want a flavor of it, then, yes,
  it will do. The only reason. The only reason I''m cautious is because you''ve got
  search shopping and PMAX in there.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah, so I''m just looking at. Go on.'
- 'Me: And I was just checking. They do. They do all actually show in there. Now,
  you won''t get everything if you added all those search terms up.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: The number of clicks and then looked at what it was for the whole account.
  They weren''t equal each other. They just don''t. And that''s just good. Google
  don''t want you to know everything. You know?'
- 'Them: No, that''s fine. I don''t want it to be mathematical. I just want to kind
  of say. Because obviously we know the brown ones. Myosin Smythins, blah, blah, blah.
  So I just want to kind of see what are the trends from the non branded terms that
  we''re seeing. So best notebooks.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Jewelry box, leather, men''s backpack.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: If I sort it by conversion value, for example. Two purses. I mean, I don''t
  know who they are, but that''s, you know, men''s other card holder. It''s just that
  get a flavor of. Okay, what are people searching for that is being picked up by
  our ads and what''s converting. So I''ve just searched by assorted by conversion
  value.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yep.'
- 'Them: And just picked out a couple of the ones that don''t have the word smarter
  than it, to be honest.'
- 'Me: Yep. Oh, some Belters. Absolute Belters. It''s. You know, we saw that the other
  day about the. Looking at Brown against non brands and how it''s improved. Obviously.
  The non branders we''ve seen is more expensive. But then new customers.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So it''s an interesting stuff that comes up, to be honest.'
- 'Me: It''s going to be very interesting when this is all done and dusted and we''re
  in a bit of a calm time is to do some analysis on. On. Brand non brand and see whether
  we''ve been getting a new custom data out of this as well. Is that new customer?
  Sorry I''m jumping around, but is that customer match data still being uploaded?
  You know that''s CSV file.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I checked it about two weeks ago.'
- 'Me: Right. Great.'
- 'Them: Because I. I wasn''t sure, but it''s been tiny. Done by. The separate team.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: They''re just the sheets connected to ads, and they''re just uploading the
  the Delta every week.'
- 'Me: Fantastic. That''s good. Especially now, it''s really, really important right
  now that we get that, that data, right? We might be able to get some, some information
  about new customers, because you can actually.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: New versus returning. Last seven days. Total account. Right. Let me show you
  this. Again. This is. This is going to be for afterwards. I''m just disappearing
  at my own today. You know, they''ve been Cyber Monday. This is one of those, isn''t
  it? Right. Okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''m looking at campaigns.'
- 'Them: Right.'
- 'Me: Let me show you that. So that''s the uk campaigns. If you go to segment. And.
  Conversions.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: New versus returning. Okay, so now it''s giving you a segment. So you got unknown,
  new and returning. So I think they''re self explanatory. Unknown would be Google
  have no idea who these people are. So it''s going to put them in and unknown bucket.
  They could have cookies set. They could be, you know, they don''t interact, whatever
  it is. Or they could be. They could not have a Google account.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Me: So if you go to important to go to this here really total account. You can
  see I''ve got this conversions here in this and column. So if you come down to unknown
  384unknown. 482 new customers and 102 returning customers.'
- 'Them: Nice.'
- 'Me: So the only bit you don''t know is is the unknown. Which is why it''s.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, I mean, that''s. They''ll always be.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: An element of that.'
- 'Me: Eah. I don''t know whether you could construe that. If you had. If you looked
  at new customers against returning customers, in that. In that particular instance,
  you got 482 returning customers. For a related to new customers 102 returning customers.
  Does that mean that 80% of your, you know, could you extrapolate that out and say
  it''s 80% of all the sales are coming from new customers? You say unknown out of
  it completely and just do it as a ratio. You know, why. Why wouldn''t. Why would
  new customers like to do an unknown or a new. And is it the same ratio to returning
  an unknown? But at least it gives you a starting point. I think it''s a. I think
  it''s a fantastic figure. And I just pinged you an email over the other day about.
  It is Salesforce you use, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah, I did see that in man on the Weekend, actually.'
- 'Me: Right, so what I''ve. What I''ve got is, and I''m doing this for, for all my
  customers is I can plug into the API now. Of their ecommerce system. And do some
  more analysis on it. So actually, you know, do a proper analysis on, we''re saying,
  say for instance, on, on Google, as you said, we''ve sold X number of this product.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: How does that reflect through on your system of how many you actually sold
  away? What percentages out of that are there, Are there particular products on your
  admin system you''re selling shed loads of. And we''re not selling anything on Google
  Ads. It''s gonna, it''s gonna identify some opportunities so that that''s just a
  few little bits and pieces about what could potentially do with it. And it''s only
  read only access. It''s not. It''s not right at all.'
- 'Them: No, it''s fine. I''m just gonna. While I want to call this. Forward it to
  bear. Who''s in charge of this stuff? I''ll put you in copy.'
- 'Me: Okay? Fantastic. Thank you. Again. This is going to have to be after. Christmas,
  I think. Unless it''s.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Giving me some great insights. Now, on on customer data.'
- 'Them: You''ll see that in copy in a sec. Just simply.'
- 'Me: Wonderful. Thank you. So, yeah, that''s. That''s. I think that''s one of the
  wins from the last few months, at least. The. The number of new customers that are
  coming through. The only downside is that there''s no actual KPI for that in the
  business yet. As to what percentage that needs to be, and also there being an allowance
  in the marketing spend for that.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. And that''s the thing. It''s. It''s always a bit like any sort
  of awareness campaign. It''s always the first thing that gets knocked on the head
  as soon as there''s a bit of pressure on sales targets. It becomes, you know, don''t
  worry. You know, just someone buy something from somewhere. Annoyingly.'
- 'Me: But it would be nice to actually come back to the business and say, what about
  lifetime value? You know, if we''d somehow we can do some analysis on lifetime value,
  especially if it''s. If we could identify that it''s a Google Ads customer coming
  through. Don''t know whether you can or not. Then that would justify doing a cpa
  target rather than I know the roas target.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: We can dream.'
- 'Them: Was I last week? Was I only working in the one sheet? The post Black Friday,
  Black Friday activation list sheet. There wasn''t two sheets, were there for, like,
  assets and text.'
- 'Me: There''s a. There''s an rsa one.'
- 'Them: I''m bloody. Find it. I know I''ve saved it.'
- 'Me: Should be in the chat.'
- 'Them: Problem is I''ve got so many folders for each subject to look after, but
  then in the actual folders, It''s a fucking mess.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''ve got. The shared special.'
- 'Me: Sorry. I was going to say, that''s another thing you never go back on and go,
  oh, let''s just. Step back from this and let''s just tidy everything up.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I''ve got it.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I''ve got it. Yeah. Right. Let me just put one of this PPC and put it in
  the top. Okay, so in terms of where we''re at, Just want to jump over to the stuff
  from tomorrow, then I think.'
- 'Me: You saw that thing about the one image ad in the. The one image in the pmax.
  Pmax asset group.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, the lowest one now is.'
- 'Me: Great stuff.'
- 'Them: Four.'
- 'Me: So it needs to be. There needs to be a landscape and a square. It doesn''t
  need the portrait. But, you know, if you''ve got one banger in.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I might take about these a bit more when they''re live, but I''m just
  looking across. Yeah. So in terms of the post Black Friday activation, this sheet,
  so the PMAX stuff.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: They''re all filled in now. Us, uk, rest of the world, Europe. So.'
- 'Me: Brilliant. Thank you. Well, I''m going to drive on those again today. I''ve
  done it four times already, but I''m going to dry run it again. Just make sure they
  all go in.'
- 'Them: That''s. Yeah. So that''s headlines, long headlines, descriptions and image
  asset ids all done.'
- 'Me: Wonderful. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.'
- 'Them: Now. I know. It''s fine. It''s good, actually. I don''t mind. I quite like
  getting back into. Always get a bit worried. Yeah. Yeah. I don''t like staying away
  from it for too long because then you end up forgetting where stuff lives.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: The only in terms of rsas post black Friday. I''m pretty much happy with
  uk us. And rest of the world.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: So I''ve just changed the color of the tabs. The green once they''re good.'
- 'Me: Eah. Yep.'
- 'Them: Europe. The only ones I haven''t touched are the translated ones. You''ll
  see some gaps on the Europe tab.'
- 'Me: I don''t. I don''t think there are any that were Black Friday, to be honest.'
- 'Them: Yes, I took all the tuple away. Anything related to 30% in Black Friday out.
  But what. I don''t know if we ever not we. But I''m not sure if Lauren ever saved
  down.'
- 'Me: No. She didn''t.'
- 'Them: So I might just arrange for them to be. Worked on this week.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Otherwise, that''s mostly done. So I think we''re in terms of assets
  and text and imagery, I think we''re fine for tomorrow. The main thing will be.
  Once you''ve. I guess from probably Wednesday, I''ll start working on the promo.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So are you happy for me to drop in? One to two headlines. Per country. And.
  For the rsas and for the pmax.'
- 'Me: Yeah, sure, yeah.'
- 'Them: We don''t need to piss about too much. I think I''ll pretty much just. Replace
  a couple of what might be. The weakest ones with the up to 20% off whatever it is
  we''re going to call it.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Might replace one description. For example, I''ll probably just highlight
  where the changes have been made.'
- 'Me: Yeah, that''d be good. Yes. He''s not bothered about the colors in the background.
  It is just going to take the text. So if you do that.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I thought. I thought. Yeah. I thought it''s much better. At least the
  colors we can kind of see, which. Is where we''re at. And then you can always just
  put it back to black and white when using.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And all I need is for you to just to wait until everything''s in, till
  I give you the go ahead.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So if you''re changing it tomorrow, I''ll wait till Wednesday anyway.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Cool.'
- 'Them: And then is that same process again with the assets. I will probably just
  add. The because we''ve got room on almost all of the pmax campaigns to add in.
  Just. I''ll add them in as additional images. For the 20% off.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: But. Because then we can just take them straight back out again.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Cool. All right, that''s fine. So.'
- 'Me: If you wanted to color code it, that they''re the ones that are going to come
  out.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I think I might do. Yeah. So I''ll put everything back to. I''ll reset
  it now that all the stuff that''s done, and maybe I''ll just keep the tabs green.
  So that''s all good for tomorrow. And then I''ll just highlight what the promo ones
  are. And then we know exactly what to take back out.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: After the promo.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Cool. Okay, so now it goes. I think we''re in a good place. For tomorrow.'
- 'Me: If it works.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s on your head. I''ve sat there for six hours on Friday putting
  all the testing.'
- 'Me: I''m. Gonna. Oh, I''m gonna be shitting myself, I really am. It''s. I''ve.
  I''ve tested it so many times. I got so many rollbacks on it. Sony backups, and
  it''s. It''s unbelievable. But there''s still going to be that bit where you just
  go, okay. I''ve actually got into another customer and changed some of their RSAs.
  And asset groups using the same process just to make sure it works.'
- 'Them: If you. I''ll be on the train tomorrow morning from like, seven, so. If it
  all goes peaked on just WhatsApp me. And then when I see your name appear on my
  phone, I''ll know not to look.'
- 'Me: Sure. I''m going to WhatsApp you then. Go what may.'
- 'Them: Cool. I hope we got a good process here, though. This will be all right.
  This will work.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s just getting it working. It''s. As I say, it''s a. It''s a new
  kind of concept. I''ve had to jump through hoops trying different things out with
  Google, but it would, it will be a good thing if it works, to roll forward because
  it''s like you. Know, taking Christmas off and stuff, you can just go straight into
  there and just change it, you know, It''s. It''s.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s easy enough to do. There''s still some in there that aren''t sentence
  case.'
- 'Them: Oh, no. It is. Yeah. Yeah, I did see some. But then, interestingly, what
  I thought was odd was when you go into Google Ads itself and you. I don''t know.
  Go into a PMAX asset group and look at headlines. When they give you examples, they''ve
  got it capitalized still.'
- 'Me: I know. And that''s the confusion with it all. You know, there''s stuff I sent
  you through the other day. The analysis is just third party analysis on what''s
  working and what''s not.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Working. So would it make much difference? I don''t know.'
- 'Them: No. Well, what I''ve done is. For this. For now, I''ve kept it with the status
  quo. So I just followed what was the most. Yeah, if it was capitalizing the sheet,
  we''ll just keep it capitalized for now.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Rather than have me put the new ones in is like sentence case, and then it''s
  going to mix or capitalize ones. I''d rather just all one way or the other way.
  And for now it''s all capitalized, which is fine.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. I mean, within, within ads editor, you can actually just go pick
  the assets and just say change it to sentence case. But then you have to remember,
  okay, well, what is uppercase? Is Panama uppercase?'
- 'Them: So names and stuff? Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. On street. You know, all those bits and pieces. What. What is actually
  supposed to be uppercase and what isn''t, which has never had to be decided before.
  But if we had it, if we had a translation list between the two of them, it would
  make it. You know, it would make it easier to do.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But again, losing sleep over it.'
- 'Them: Just come. Nine. No, no, no. I think it''s just consistency either way.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Just so one way or another, it''s. It''s either that or this.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, cool. What else did we have that. Oh. What did you reckon on the. Competitor
  RSA then for the uk. So I saw it was about three and a half. Row s. Obviously it''s
  not really doing much in terms of. It spent 250 quid in the last seven days.'
- 'Me: Let me have a look.'
- 'Them: It''s. Not. It''s not stinking the place out.'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: But equally, it''s. I''ll do an update to Seb on it anyway.'
- 'Me: There''s only one conversion with the search term on it as well. Which is annoying.
  Also me doesn''t track everything. It''s. It''s Aspen. All that has, actually. Converted.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So we stole one customer.'
- 'Me: Like 710 ROAS as well, which is really annoying. Because it''s actually quite
  good. Two pound fifty one average cpc. I. I just. I just. Well, you know what I
  think? I just think takes up so much time for something that''s so irrelevant. And
  he''s not going to make us an absolute fortune.'
- 'Them: Have we got them? I''ll. Yeah, I''ll see what he says then. In at 2:00. If
  we got any in the us. EU and rest of the world that we could just pause because
  I think I saw.'
- 'Me: The us has got one. Or not.'
- 'Them: Yeah, because we can definitely save money there. I mean, it''s not. I think
  Lauren has set them up.'
- 'Me: Hing. Live.'
- 'Them: Oh, no, that''s paused. Well, I''m falling fine.'
- 'Me: Yeah, that was. That was. I don''t know when that was, but it has been paused.'
- 'Them: Okay? That''s cool.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I think the main thing for me is just managing your expectations. There''s
  no way we''re going to hit the revenue target. I''m the most positive guy in the
  world as far as these can things concern me. It''s just not going to happen. It
  really is not going to happen.'
- 'Them: We just need lips from other channels. That''s a. Hang on.'
- 'Me: I think so. Yeah, I think so. You know, we''ve given it the best shot, but.
  Hindsight. Don''t spend the money at the beginning of the month. It has been one
  of the most phased things ever over the last week, I suppose, but it was. It''s
  a case of waiting until the conversion rate was good. It''s like we''re going to
  do now the first two weeks of December to spend more there than we do in the last
  two weeks in December.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, no one''s. You really do. Fall off a cliff.
  I think there''s a week where. You just will not set anything and get probably from
  like. Probably from, like,'
- 'Me: The 15th, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. 15th to the 23rd will be slow. There''s a bit of last minute, but obviously
  us and the rest of the world switch off first and in Europe follows and then it
  is just the uk, so it does drop down.'
- "Me: Yeah. I mean, this budget is really extreme because those last three days,\
  \ maybe from. The 21st, maybe till the 20eigth. It's going to have about \xA3300\
  \ a day budget. That's it."
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, because, I mean, no one''s going to. Be. We''re not going to
  be converting anyone, are we, at that stage?'
- 'Me: And they, they''re traditionally, you know, we go, we go from a 4.8. Roas last
  year for this this week down to a 4 and a 3.5 over that Christmas period. So, you
  know, there''s no point in spending money then when you''re not going to convert
  as well.'
- 'Them: No. And then we''ve got, I think, five weeks of sale from the 24th.'
- 'Me: Yeah, we should be driven by email.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Oh, there''s a lot to do in that.'
- 'Me: It''s. It''s nuts this time of year. It really is. As you.'
- 'Them: Please. Well, yeah, yeah. I''m just pleased the two bits I don''t have to.
  Well, I still have to look after, but I don''t have to. Go in and build stuff is
  paid, social and email.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Thankfully, I''ve at least not two people that. Can do that for me.'
- 'Me: Yeah. As a full time job. That''s the funny bit.'
- 'Them: Well, this is what I kind of thinking about digital marketing. It''s like
  every. Because, like my peer who looks after the website, It''s a very general role,
  so, you know, moving stuff around, looking at the search terms and the page speed,
  so, like, all of you can be experts in the whole thing. Whereas with the digital
  marketing side, There''s such different like SEO to email to paid search paid so
  they are expertise in themselves. And there''s no way you can.'
- 'Me: When I first started client side, I did all of them. In fact, back in 2000,
  they did all of them. So for 10 years, it''s like doing SEO affiliates, email. You
  know, the price comparison engines, all that, all that kind of stuff. But especially
  SEO. I mean, it''s just a. A dark art. You know, because if you ever say to someone,
  ask. Yeah? Why is that not appearing? Well, I changed it a week ago. It take three
  months to take effect. All right. Okay. And they''re hoping that you''re going to
  have forgotten influence time that you asked them to do it. So it''s. It''s not
  for me. I see how anymore.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Especially when you''re now getting into Chat GPT as well. You know where you
  need. Did you. Did I send you that stuff on the LLM txt file? I presume that was.
  I think you said you took that to the SEO guys.'
- 'Them: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so I just got a new. Consultant on board last week. First year.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So that''s on my full time, but they weren''t really. Were we needing them
  to be?'
- 'Me: You are a hardship manner. Aren''t you?'
- 'Them: I know, I know. My mother in law said that to me yesterday. She said, how
  many have you got now? I said, what? At my career?'
- 'Me: It''s very. So when you start buying stickers on your computer, that''s when
  you start worrying.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, I know. So I''ve just gone with. Yeah, I''ve gone with an old
  consultant. That I''ve worked with just to.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Because interestingly, the UK SEO like organic searches in the mud.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: But we''re not doing anything. But the US Is growing. But we''re not doing
  anything.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So I think I figure that one out. Like how on earth is how we grow in one
  market organically, but not the other. But we''re not doing anything one either.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Search shadow. Unravel it all and you end up just saying yes. It''s
  the financial situation at the moment that''s doing it.'
- 'Them: 70 ads.'
- 'Me: Yeah, because you''ve no idea, really. You know, it''s.'
- 'Them: No, everything is a huge pinch of salt as well.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I''ve got one. Luxury branded crap over Black Friday. Absolutely awful.
  And yet it''s the people with the money who don''t, who are normally not affected
  by it. But certainly not this time.'
- 'Them: There never seems to be enough people with the money that want to spend.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: It.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Interestingly enough, European. Spend. Was down on the we master pump some
  money in last year. We spent nearly 13 grand last week last year.'
- 'Me: Gosh, I really pushed Europe as well because it was doing very well.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. We spent 13 on paid social. 12 and a half. Sorry. 13 on paid
  search, 12 and a half on raid social. However. This is where it''s weird. Revenue
  plus 102% for 32% less spend.'
- 'Me: Overall.'
- 'Them: So total paid channel revenue.'
- 'Me: Buddy. Oh. Is that on target, though?'
- 'Them: Now it''s minus five to the target. But +102 last year.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: That''s a result. So there were more ambitious this year on the targets than
  last year.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, you gotta. It''s because. I mean, I don''t know, obviously I''m
  not involved in the conversations. At the top, but. There it was, you know, they
  wanted growth year on year. But it was never quite clear. It was almost like just
  someone you''re not just figure out. Where it''s coming.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: So you got to put the numbers in some way to make it add up. It''s what they
  get paid the big bucks for.'
- 'Me: Yeah, definitely. Definitely.'
- 'Them: Them. Oh, there you go. Best come back. All your boots. To that. She said,
  Sami, Because I don''t know what it means.'
- 'Me: I''ll ask claude. Nice. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. That is brilliant. Right.'
- 'Them: All good.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, that''s fantastic. So that was all the bits I''d asked for.'
- 'Them: I hope so. She''s normally quite switched on.'
- 'Me: Well, she''s in. I''ve got an email from her now. If I need anything, I just.
  I''ll. I''ll CC you in on it, but. Yeah, I''m sure.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, by all means. No, but it''s. That''s. That''s
  her world. She knows what she''s talking about there. I don''t have a clue what.
  What she talks about half the time.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But she''s good, all right. I''ll. Jump off. Well, if there''s nothing else,
  I do try and do another quick call before, too, but.'
- 'Me: Sorry. The ad extensions. Very quickly. The ad extensions are all scheduled,
  so you might see them in there, but they''re not going to show after today. For
  black Friday.'
- 'Them: Oh, okay. Perfect. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But yeah, so it''s fingers crossed for tomorrow. There''s shitloads of backups,
  mate. I''ll drop it all down into Google. That adds editor as well. So if the worst
  comes to worst, I just fire everything back in and straight as it is. There''s no.
  There''s no risk. I just want it to work right. First time for my own.'
- 'Them: Well, yeah, because then we know we''re in a good place then, don''t we?
  No, that''s fine. I''ll. Just see if someone''s putting like, a meeting for 9 o''clock
  tomorrow. Go away.'
- 'Me: It''d be lone. Ly.'
- 'Them: Thank you. I didn''t even ask for it as well. From Meta. No, thanks. Yeah,
  I''ll obviously jump on. I''ve got a half nine. I''ve got a 9 and a half, 9, a 10,
  a half, 10, 11. So at some point, if I''m lucky, there might be a gap and I''ll
  just get on and just do some front end checks.'
- 'Me: Brilliant. All right.'
- 'Them: And, like, yeah, just as a. As a glance, just to see it.'
- 'Me: Okay? Just double check. Just give me a heads up when the RSA is to be done
  today just so I can.'
- 'Them: But yeah. Yeah, I''m just gonna. I just want to double check all the links
  and stuff and make sure there''s nothing else that. So I might just do an hour this
  afternoon and I''ll come back before the end of the day. We''ve got a paid search.
  Catch up in for tomorrow 11. We don''t need that, do we?'
- 'Me: Okay? Well, that. That was. I think that was the one that Lauren had set up,
  wasn''t it? So.'
- 'Them: Yeah. You''re happy doing this? Monday one, Then we''ll.'
- 'Me: Mate. Yeah, I''m fine. Yeah, it gives me enough time to have a look at things.
  I just need to try and make sure it actually goes into my diary now, because it''s
  not doing so. But yeah. Cool.'
- 'Them: Delete that. There you go. So I can check stuff at 11 now? It''s taken one
  out. Good stuff. All right. Well, yeah, give me a shout on teams as any other bits
  you need from me. Although, yeah, chat, you know.'
- 'Me: Do you get teams when you''re out the office or do. Is it WhatsApp when you''re
  out the office?'
- 'Them: I get the note, okay?'
- 'Me: You do all right.'
- 'Them: I''m fully, unfortunately, fully connected to this business, no matter where
  I go. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. No, I get. I get notifications on my phone, so that''s
  fine.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Nice one. Thank you. Cheers.'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Them: 18 1. Which is 145 of which is the old Google budget. Plus 39 of new. So if you've got one seven one, that's 10 of our 12 sorted. There.
- Me: Okay? Well, November. I've always had 1, 8, 6.
- Them: Yeah, that's what I've got. Hang on, I've got 186051 for P8 third, two or 30th.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: For the 1st till the 20eigth of December. P9 I've got 1-80963.
- Me: Right. Okay. I've got 1-83929, but it's pretty nice. It's three grand, isn't it?
- Them: Well, I'll tell you what I know. Why that's three grand is because I approximate your cost into that. So I've got 1, 8, 3. But I just take off. Portion. Three grand, for example, just to make sure that your costs is accounted for.
- Me: Oh, I see. Okay?
- Them: Something. If you work to 180. And then we've just got. Well, if you work to 181. For google.
- Me: And you start taking Nick into consideration. The overspend for P8.
- Them: No.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So if we take. How much did we ever spend? 12 and up.
- Me: 12. I think it was 11 summit.
- Them: So we've got one. Six, eight, nine, six, three. Now we could. Pause. Bing. Because that's three grand.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: And put that three back in to Google instead. If you think that's.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Do that.
- Me: It's more likely to be controlled.
- Them: Well, let's do that then. So Bing becomes. Zero.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: For P9. So we'll just pause all that, Just keeps it simple.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: And that means that Google for PD9 becomes 171963, so 17 2.
- Me: Right. I'm back where I was then, right? Okay.
- Them: Yeah. So that means we're taking a 12 overspend. We're taking 9 off Google and 3 off thing.
- Me: Y. Eah. Okay? So that doesn't so where where we are then with. So I've got total spend 171 in the in the projection.
- Them: Cool. Yeah.
- Me: So we'll come in on budget revenue of 809,9500. So that's with a an optimistic budget, an optimistic ROAS of 4.73. The only way. The only way we could hit. The. Expected revenue is by increasing roas to 6.56.
- Them: Well, I think it's a month of two halves, isn't it?
- Me: Wow. What I've got is seven days. Seven days of cyber week. So this is looking at conversion rates from last year.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Then mid December. Plus the diaries. For seven days. Potentially, then four days, where at that point that Europe and the rest of the world stop. I need to put that final little bit in. We got three days of the finishing off for the US. And then Christmas, four days. Boxing Day. Three days of Boxing Day up to Boxing day and the 26, 27, 28th. So I've got a. I've got a budget in there for those that varies. So the next seven days I got eight and a half grands.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Mid December go to nine and a half grand, because that's when we're likely to get the best. Return. Mid month eigth of the 14th. And then, as I say, Europe and possibly rest of the world stop, and we can allocate some of the budget. To the the other campaigns, but there's not a great deal left then. So. Yes, it is. It is very much of two halves. We've got probably 14, 15, maybe 15 days. And then it kicks off again after Boxing Day. Very low level. Now, this is. These projections. I. I'll give you a. I'll give you a final version of this one. I know what the last order dates are. Because it's almost like Europe and rest of world just. Just stop them. Just, you know, people want this for Christmas. What's the point in spending everything on them?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I. I don't want to completely pause them, but I would just drop the budgets down to as low, as low as I could, just as a marker so that they do actually start again in the new year. But I'll be able to give you some. I'd be able to give you a better idea once I know when those last order dates. Are.
- Them: Yeah, I'm just painting them in our chat now. I just needed confirmation.
- Me: Nice.
- Them: So you have 16th, 16th, 17th and 21st. I'd ignore the click and collect one. Because not really sounding relevant for local.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: People to slow.
- Me: Just bear with me while I just paste this into.
- Them: So we probably want, which I'll. Happy to add in close to the time. Adding some site links, I suspect just drop them in to say order by.
- Me: Y.
- Them: But I can drop those in. To your sheet for you.
- Me: Ep. Sure.
- Them: To outline.
- Me: Not a notch. Not in the sheet that's still got the acid text in. That's just aspect. If you put anything else in there.
- Them: Oh, okay. I just put them in the account. Then.
- Me: Just. Just ping them over to me, that's fine.
- Them: Okay? Okay?
- Me: No. Well, I know what they are. I can put. I can stick those in. Yeah, that's not a problem.
- Them: Okay. Yeah, fine. Yeah. So I think we can probably put them.
- Me: That's not.
- Them: In? Well, whenever, really. I guess. Couldn't we? Because we're in the cinema.
- Me: I can't. I can. Yeah, I can schedule them in. That's not a problem.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, let's get. Yeah, let's get them in after tomorrow. So this week, I guess. One quick question. I was just doing some analysis on the performance. In google glance. Insights and reports. Search terms.
- Me: Any particular account.
- Them: No. Whichever one you fancy. I'm in the UK at the minute.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I'll just share as well so you can see where I'm running around. So I just want to look at non brand terms, performance of non brand terms for the last week. So I've put a filter on. Says campaign name does not contain brand. Date filters last seven days, and then it gives me this search term report. Obviously this brand times in there. But is this a fair way of analyzing. What terms? Are doing better than others. So, for example, best notebooks.
- Me: Well, it depends what you what you're going to use it for.
- Them: It's just an update to say, because obviously, when I'm looking at. Traffic.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Non brand traffic in the UK for paid search was up on the year. So you see this highlighted row? Non brand Traffic is up 52%.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: I'm not trying to explain all of that 52%. I'm just trying to give a flavor of what were some of the better performing. Non brand. Terms that we picked up for last week.
- Me: The Oxy question is. Probably. Let me just. Yes. Yes is the answer.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It won't give you everything, but if you just want a flavor of it, then, yes, it will do. The only reason. The only reason I'm cautious is because you've got search shopping and PMAX in there.
- Them: Okay? Yeah, so I'm just looking at. Go on.
- Me: And I was just checking. They do. They do all actually show in there. Now, you won't get everything if you added all those search terms up.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Me: The number of clicks and then looked at what it was for the whole account. They weren't equal each other. They just don't. And that's just good. Google don't want you to know everything. You know?
- Them: No, that's fine. I don't want it to be mathematical. I just want to kind of say. Because obviously we know the brown ones. Myosin Smythins, blah, blah, blah. So I just want to kind of see what are the trends from the non branded terms that we're seeing. So best notebooks.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Jewelry box, leather, men's backpack.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: If I sort it by conversion value, for example. Two purses. I mean, I don't know who they are, but that's, you know, men's other card holder. It's just that get a flavor of. Okay, what are people searching for that is being picked up by our ads and what's converting. So I've just searched by assorted by conversion value.
- Me: Yeah. Yep.
- Them: And just picked out a couple of the ones that don't have the word smarter than it, to be honest.
- Me: Yep. Oh, some Belters. Absolute Belters. It's. You know, we saw that the other day about the. Looking at Brown against non brands and how it's improved. Obviously. The non branders we've seen is more expensive. But then new customers.
- Them: Yeah. So it's an interesting stuff that comes up, to be honest.
- Me: It's going to be very interesting when this is all done and dusted and we're in a bit of a calm time is to do some analysis on. On. Brand non brand and see whether we've been getting a new custom data out of this as well. Is that new customer? Sorry I'm jumping around, but is that customer match data still being uploaded? You know that's CSV file.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: Yeah, I checked it about two weeks ago.
- Me: Right. Great.
- Them: Because I. I wasn't sure, but it's been tiny. Done by. The separate team.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: They're just the sheets connected to ads, and they're just uploading the the Delta every week.
- Me: Fantastic. That's good. Especially now, it's really, really important right now that we get that, that data, right? We might be able to get some, some information about new customers, because you can actually.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: New versus returning. Last seven days. Total account. Right. Let me show you this. Again. This is. This is going to be for afterwards. I'm just disappearing at my own today. You know, they've been Cyber Monday. This is one of those, isn't it? Right. Okay.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I'm looking at campaigns.
- Them: Right.
- Me: Let me show you that. So that's the uk campaigns. If you go to segment. And. Conversions.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: New versus returning. Okay, so now it's giving you a segment. So you got unknown, new and returning. So I think they're self explanatory. Unknown would be Google have no idea who these people are. So it's going to put them in and unknown bucket. They could have cookies set. They could be, you know, they don't interact, whatever it is. Or they could be. They could not have a Google account.
- Them: Yeah. Okay?
- Me: So if you go to important to go to this here really total account. You can see I've got this conversions here in this and column. So if you come down to unknown 384unknown. 482 new customers and 102 returning customers.
- Them: Nice.
- Me: So the only bit you don't know is is the unknown. Which is why it's.
- Them: Yeah, well, I mean, that's. They'll always be.
- Me: Y.
- Them: An element of that.
- Me: Eah. I don't know whether you could construe that. If you had. If you looked at new customers against returning customers, in that. In that particular instance, you got 482 returning customers. For a related to new customers 102 returning customers. Does that mean that 80% of your, you know, could you extrapolate that out and say it's 80% of all the sales are coming from new customers? You say unknown out of it completely and just do it as a ratio. You know, why. Why wouldn't. Why would new customers like to do an unknown or a new. And is it the same ratio to returning an unknown? But at least it gives you a starting point. I think it's a. I think it's a fantastic figure. And I just pinged you an email over the other day about. It is Salesforce you use, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah, I did see that in man on the Weekend, actually.
- Me: Right, so what I've. What I've got is, and I'm doing this for, for all my customers is I can plug into the API now. Of their ecommerce system. And do some more analysis on it. So actually, you know, do a proper analysis on, we're saying, say for instance, on, on Google, as you said, we've sold X number of this product.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: How does that reflect through on your system of how many you actually sold away? What percentages out of that are there, Are there particular products on your admin system you're selling shed loads of. And we're not selling anything on Google Ads. It's gonna, it's gonna identify some opportunities so that that's just a few little bits and pieces about what could potentially do with it. And it's only read only access. It's not. It's not right at all.
- Them: No, it's fine. I'm just gonna. While I want to call this. Forward it to bear. Who's in charge of this stuff? I'll put you in copy.
- Me: Okay? Fantastic. Thank you. Again. This is going to have to be after. Christmas, I think. Unless it's.
- Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Me: Giving me some great insights. Now, on on customer data.
- Them: You'll see that in copy in a sec. Just simply.
- Me: Wonderful. Thank you. So, yeah, that's. That's. I think that's one of the wins from the last few months, at least. The. The number of new customers that are coming through. The only downside is that there's no actual KPI for that in the business yet. As to what percentage that needs to be, and also there being an allowance in the marketing spend for that.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. And that's the thing. It's. It's always a bit like any sort of awareness campaign. It's always the first thing that gets knocked on the head as soon as there's a bit of pressure on sales targets. It becomes, you know, don't worry. You know, just someone buy something from somewhere. Annoyingly.
- Me: But it would be nice to actually come back to the business and say, what about lifetime value? You know, if we'd somehow we can do some analysis on lifetime value, especially if it's. If we could identify that it's a Google Ads customer coming through. Don't know whether you can or not. Then that would justify doing a cpa target rather than I know the roas target.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
- Me: We can dream.
- Them: Was I last week? Was I only working in the one sheet? The post Black Friday, Black Friday activation list sheet. There wasn't two sheets, were there for, like, assets and text.
- Me: There's a. There's an rsa one.
- Them: I'm bloody. Find it. I know I've saved it.
- Me: Should be in the chat.
- Them: Problem is I've got so many folders for each subject to look after, but then in the actual folders, It's a fucking mess.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Yeah, I've got. The shared special.
- Me: Sorry. I was going to say, that's another thing you never go back on and go, oh, let's just. Step back from this and let's just tidy everything up.
- Them: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I've got it.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I've got it. Yeah. Right. Let me just put one of this PPC and put it in the top. Okay, so in terms of where we're at, Just want to jump over to the stuff from tomorrow, then I think.
- Me: You saw that thing about the one image ad in the. The one image in the pmax. Pmax asset group.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, the lowest one now is.
- Me: Great stuff.
- Them: Four.
- Me: So it needs to be. There needs to be a landscape and a square. It doesn't need the portrait. But, you know, if you've got one banger in.
- Them: Yeah. I might take about these a bit more when they're live, but I'm just looking across. Yeah. So in terms of the post Black Friday activation, this sheet, so the PMAX stuff.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: They're all filled in now. Us, uk, rest of the world, Europe. So.
- Me: Brilliant. Thank you. Well, I'm going to drive on those again today. I've done it four times already, but I'm going to dry run it again. Just make sure they all go in.
- Them: That's. Yeah. So that's headlines, long headlines, descriptions and image asset ids all done.
- Me: Wonderful. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.
- Them: Now. I know. It's fine. It's good, actually. I don't mind. I quite like getting back into. Always get a bit worried. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like staying away from it for too long because then you end up forgetting where stuff lives.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Them: The only in terms of rsas post black Friday. I'm pretty much happy with uk us. And rest of the world.
- Me: Y.
- Them: So I've just changed the color of the tabs. The green once they're good.
- Me: Eah. Yep.
- Them: Europe. The only ones I haven't touched are the translated ones. You'll see some gaps on the Europe tab.
- Me: I don't. I don't think there are any that were Black Friday, to be honest.
- Them: Yes, I took all the tuple away. Anything related to 30% in Black Friday out. But what. I don't know if we ever not we. But I'm not sure if Lauren ever saved down.
- Me: No. She didn't.
- Them: So I might just arrange for them to be. Worked on this week.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Yeah. Otherwise, that's mostly done. So I think we're in terms of assets and text and imagery, I think we're fine for tomorrow. The main thing will be. Once you've. I guess from probably Wednesday, I'll start working on the promo.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So are you happy for me to drop in? One to two headlines. Per country. And. For the rsas and for the pmax.
- Me: Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Them: We don't need to piss about too much. I think I'll pretty much just. Replace a couple of what might be. The weakest ones with the up to 20% off whatever it is we're going to call it.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Might replace one description. For example, I'll probably just highlight where the changes have been made.
- Me: Yeah, that'd be good. Yes. He's not bothered about the colors in the background. It is just going to take the text. So if you do that.
- Them: Yeah, I thought. I thought. Yeah. I thought it's much better. At least the colors we can kind of see, which. Is where we're at. And then you can always just put it back to black and white when using.
- Me: Yeah. And all I need is for you to just to wait until everything's in, till I give you the go ahead.
- Them: Yeah. So if you're changing it tomorrow, I'll wait till Wednesday anyway.
- Me: Yeah. Cool.
- Them: And then is that same process again with the assets. I will probably just add. The because we've got room on almost all of the pmax campaigns to add in. Just. I'll add them in as additional images. For the 20% off.
- Me: Yeah, yeah.
- Them: But. Because then we can just take them straight back out again.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Cool. All right, that's fine. So.
- Me: If you wanted to color code it, that they're the ones that are going to come out.
- Them: Yeah, I think I might do. Yeah. So I'll put everything back to. I'll reset it now that all the stuff that's done, and maybe I'll just keep the tabs green. So that's all good for tomorrow. And then I'll just highlight what the promo ones are. And then we know exactly what to take back out.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: After the promo.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Cool. Okay, so now it goes. I think we're in a good place. For tomorrow.
- Me: If it works.
- Them: Yeah, that's on your head. I've sat there for six hours on Friday putting all the testing.
- Me: I'm. Gonna. Oh, I'm gonna be shitting myself, I really am. It's. I've. I've tested it so many times. I got so many rollbacks on it. Sony backups, and it's. It's unbelievable. But there's still going to be that bit where you just go, okay. I've actually got into another customer and changed some of their RSAs. And asset groups using the same process just to make sure it works.
- Them: If you. I'll be on the train tomorrow morning from like, seven, so. If it all goes peaked on just WhatsApp me. And then when I see your name appear on my phone, I'll know not to look.
- Me: Sure. I'm going to WhatsApp you then. Go what may.
- Them: Cool. I hope we got a good process here, though. This will be all right. This will work.
- Me: Yeah, it's just getting it working. It's. As I say, it's a. It's a new kind of concept. I've had to jump through hoops trying different things out with Google, but it would, it will be a good thing if it works, to roll forward because it's like you. Know, taking Christmas off and stuff, you can just go straight into there and just change it, you know, It's. It's.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's easy enough to do. There's still some in there that aren't sentence case.
- Them: Oh, no. It is. Yeah. Yeah, I did see some. But then, interestingly, what I thought was odd was when you go into Google Ads itself and you. I don't know. Go into a PMAX asset group and look at headlines. When they give you examples, they've got it capitalized still.
- Me: I know. And that's the confusion with it all. You know, there's stuff I sent you through the other day. The analysis is just third party analysis on what's working and what's not.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Working. So would it make much difference? I don't know.
- Them: No. Well, what I've done is. For this. For now, I've kept it with the status quo. So I just followed what was the most. Yeah, if it was capitalizing the sheet, we'll just keep it capitalized for now.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Rather than have me put the new ones in is like sentence case, and then it's going to mix or capitalize ones. I'd rather just all one way or the other way. And for now it's all capitalized, which is fine.
- Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. I mean, within, within ads editor, you can actually just go pick the assets and just say change it to sentence case. But then you have to remember, okay, well, what is uppercase? Is Panama uppercase?
- Them: So names and stuff? Yeah.
- Me: Yeah. On street. You know, all those bits and pieces. What. What is actually supposed to be uppercase and what isn't, which has never had to be decided before. But if we had it, if we had a translation list between the two of them, it would make it. You know, it would make it easier to do.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But again, losing sleep over it.
- Them: Just come. Nine. No, no, no. I think it's just consistency either way.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Just so one way or another, it's. It's either that or this.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay, cool. What else did we have that. Oh. What did you reckon on the. Competitor RSA then for the uk. So I saw it was about three and a half. Row s. Obviously it's not really doing much in terms of. It spent 250 quid in the last seven days.
- Me: Let me have a look.
- Them: It's. Not. It's not stinking the place out.
- Me: No.
- Them: But equally, it's. I'll do an update to Seb on it anyway.
- Me: There's only one conversion with the search term on it as well. Which is annoying. Also me doesn't track everything. It's. It's Aspen. All that has, actually. Converted.
- Them: Yeah. So we stole one customer.
- Me: Like 710 ROAS as well, which is really annoying. Because it's actually quite good. Two pound fifty one average cpc. I. I just. I just. Well, you know what I think? I just think takes up so much time for something that's so irrelevant. And he's not going to make us an absolute fortune.
- Them: Have we got them? I'll. Yeah, I'll see what he says then. In at 2:00. If we got any in the us. EU and rest of the world that we could just pause because I think I saw.
- Me: The us has got one. Or not.
- Them: Yeah, because we can definitely save money there. I mean, it's not. I think Lauren has set them up.
- Me: Hing. Live.
- Them: Oh, no, that's paused. Well, I'm falling fine.
- Me: Yeah, that was. That was. I don't know when that was, but it has been paused.
- Them: Okay? That's cool.
- Me: Yeah. I think the main thing for me is just managing your expectations. There's no way we're going to hit the revenue target. I'm the most positive guy in the world as far as these can things concern me. It's just not going to happen. It really is not going to happen.
- Them: We just need lips from other channels. That's a. Hang on.
- Me: I think so. Yeah, I think so. You know, we've given it the best shot, but. Hindsight. Don't spend the money at the beginning of the month. It has been one of the most phased things ever over the last week, I suppose, but it was. It's a case of waiting until the conversion rate was good. It's like we're going to do now the first two weeks of December to spend more there than we do in the last two weeks in December.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, no one's. You really do. Fall off a cliff. I think there's a week where. You just will not set anything and get probably from like. Probably from, like,
- Me: The 15th, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. 15th to the 23rd will be slow. There's a bit of last minute, but obviously us and the rest of the world switch off first and in Europe follows and then it is just the uk, so it does drop down.
- Me: Yeah. I mean, this budget is really extreme because those last three days, maybe from. The 21st, maybe till the 20eigth. It's going to have about £300 a day budget. That's it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, because, I mean, no one's going to. Be. We're not going to be converting anyone, are we, at that stage?
- Me: And they, they're traditionally, you know, we go, we go from a 4.8. Roas last year for this this week down to a 4 and a 3.5 over that Christmas period. So, you know, there's no point in spending money then when you're not going to convert as well.
- Them: No. And then we've got, I think, five weeks of sale from the 24th.
- Me: Yeah, we should be driven by email.
- Them: Yeah. Oh, there's a lot to do in that.
- Me: It's. It's nuts this time of year. It really is. As you.
- Them: Please. Well, yeah, yeah. I'm just pleased the two bits I don't have to. Well, I still have to look after, but I don't have to. Go in and build stuff is paid, social and email.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Thankfully, I've at least not two people that. Can do that for me.
- Me: Yeah. As a full time job. That's the funny bit.
- Them: Well, this is what I kind of thinking about digital marketing. It's like every. Because, like my peer who looks after the website, It's a very general role, so, you know, moving stuff around, looking at the search terms and the page speed, so, like, all of you can be experts in the whole thing. Whereas with the digital marketing side, There's such different like SEO to email to paid search paid so they are expertise in themselves. And there's no way you can.
- Me: When I first started client side, I did all of them. In fact, back in 2000, they did all of them. So for 10 years, it's like doing SEO affiliates, email. You know, the price comparison engines, all that, all that kind of stuff. But especially SEO. I mean, it's just a. A dark art. You know, because if you ever say to someone, ask. Yeah? Why is that not appearing? Well, I changed it a week ago. It take three months to take effect. All right. Okay. And they're hoping that you're going to have forgotten influence time that you asked them to do it. So it's. It's not for me. I see how anymore.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Especially when you're now getting into Chat GPT as well. You know where you need. Did you. Did I send you that stuff on the LLM txt file? I presume that was. I think you said you took that to the SEO guys.
- Them: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: Yeah, so I just got a new. Consultant on board last week. First year.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So that's on my full time, but they weren't really. Were we needing them to be?
- Me: You are a hardship manner. Aren't you?
- Them: I know, I know. My mother in law said that to me yesterday. She said, how many have you got now? I said, what? At my career?
- Me: It's very. So when you start buying stickers on your computer, that's when you start worrying.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, I know. So I've just gone with. Yeah, I've gone with an old consultant. That I've worked with just to.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Because interestingly, the UK SEO like organic searches in the mud.
- Me: Right.
- Them: But we're not doing anything. But the US Is growing. But we're not doing anything.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So I think I figure that one out. Like how on earth is how we grow in one market organically, but not the other. But we're not doing anything one either.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Search shadow. Unravel it all and you end up just saying yes. It's the financial situation at the moment that's doing it.
- Them: 70 ads.
- Me: Yeah, because you've no idea, really. You know, it's.
- Them: No, everything is a huge pinch of salt as well.
- Me: Yeah, I've got one. Luxury branded crap over Black Friday. Absolutely awful. And yet it's the people with the money who don't, who are normally not affected by it. But certainly not this time.
- Them: There never seems to be enough people with the money that want to spend.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: It.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Interestingly enough, European. Spend. Was down on the we master pump some money in last year. We spent nearly 13 grand last week last year.
- Me: Gosh, I really pushed Europe as well because it was doing very well.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. We spent 13 on paid social. 12 and a half. Sorry. 13 on paid search, 12 and a half on raid social. However. This is where it's weird. Revenue plus 102% for 32% less spend.
- Me: Overall.
- Them: So total paid channel revenue.
- Me: Buddy. Oh. Is that on target, though?
- Them: Now it's minus five to the target. But +102 last year.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So.
- Me: That's a result. So there were more ambitious this year on the targets than last year.
- Them: Yeah, well, you gotta. It's because. I mean, I don't know, obviously I'm not involved in the conversations. At the top, but. There it was, you know, they wanted growth year on year. But it was never quite clear. It was almost like just someone you're not just figure out. Where it's coming.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: So you got to put the numbers in some way to make it add up. It's what they get paid the big bucks for.
- Me: Yeah, definitely. Definitely.
- Them: Them. Oh, there you go. Best come back. All your boots. To that. She said, Sami, Because I don't know what it means.
- Me: I'll ask claude. Nice. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. That is brilliant. Right.
- Them: All good.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, that's fantastic. So that was all the bits I'd asked for.
- Them: I hope so. She's normally quite switched on.
- Me: Well, she's in. I've got an email from her now. If I need anything, I just. I'll. I'll CC you in on it, but. Yeah, I'm sure.
- Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, by all means. No, but it's. That's. That's her world. She knows what she's talking about there. I don't have a clue what. What she talks about half the time.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But she's good, all right. I'll. Jump off. Well, if there's nothing else, I do try and do another quick call before, too, but.
- Me: Sorry. The ad extensions. Very quickly. The ad extensions are all scheduled, so you might see them in there, but they're not going to show after today. For black Friday.
- Them: Oh, okay. Perfect. Yeah.
- Me: But yeah, so it's fingers crossed for tomorrow. There's shitloads of backups, mate. I'll drop it all down into Google. That adds editor as well. So if the worst comes to worst, I just fire everything back in and straight as it is. There's no. There's no risk. I just want it to work right. First time for my own.
- Them: Well, yeah, because then we know we're in a good place then, don't we? No, that's fine. I'll. Just see if someone's putting like, a meeting for 9 o'clock tomorrow. Go away.
- Me: It'd be lone. Ly.
- Them: Thank you. I didn't even ask for it as well. From Meta. No, thanks. Yeah, I'll obviously jump on. I've got a half nine. I've got a 9 and a half, 9, a 10, a half, 10, 11. So at some point, if I'm lucky, there might be a gap and I'll just get on and just do some front end checks.
- Me: Brilliant. All right.
- Them: And, like, yeah, just as a. As a glance, just to see it.
- Me: Okay? Just double check. Just give me a heads up when the RSA is to be done today just so I can.
- Them: But yeah. Yeah, I'm just gonna. I just want to double check all the links and stuff and make sure there's nothing else that. So I might just do an hour this afternoon and I'll come back before the end of the day. We've got a paid search. Catch up in for tomorrow 11. We don't need that, do we?
- Me: Okay? Well, that. That was. I think that was the one that Lauren had set up, wasn't it? So.
- Them: Yeah. You're happy doing this? Monday one, Then we'll.
- Me: Mate. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, it gives me enough time to have a look at things. I just need to try and make sure it actually goes into my diary now, because it's not doing so. But yeah. Cool.
- Them: Delete that. There you go. So I can check stuff at 11 now? It's taken one out. Good stuff. All right. Well, yeah, give me a shout on teams as any other bits you need from me. Although, yeah, chat, you know.
- Me: Do you get teams when you're out the office or do. Is it WhatsApp when you're out the office?
- Them: I get the note, okay?
- Me: You do all right.
- Them: I'm fully, unfortunately, fully connected to this business, no matter where I go. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. No, I get. I get notifications on my phone, so that's fine.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Nice one. Thank you. Cheers.

Them: 18 1. Which is 145 of which is the old Google budget. Plus 39 of new. So if you've got one seven one, that's 10 of our 12 sorted. There.
Me: Okay? Well, November. I've always had 1, 8, 6.
Them: Yeah, that's what I've got. Hang on, I've got 186051 for P8 third, two or 30th.
Me: Yeah.
Them: For the 1st till the 20eigth of December. P9 I've got 1-80963.
Me: Right. Okay. I've got 1-83929, but it's pretty nice. It's three grand, isn't it?
Them: Well, I'll tell you what I know. Why that's three grand is because I approximate your cost into that. So I've got 1, 8, 3. But I just take off. Portion. Three grand, for example, just to make sure that your costs is accounted for.
Me: Oh, I see. Okay?
Them: Something. If you work to 180. And then we've just got. Well, if you work to 181. For google.
Me: And you start taking Nick into consideration. The overspend for P8.
Them: No.
Me: Right.
Them: So if we take. How much did we ever spend? 12 and up.
Me: 12. I think it was 11 summit.
Them: So we've got one. Six, eight, nine, six, three. Now we could. Pause. Bing. Because that's three grand.
Me: Okay?
Them: And put that three back in to Google instead. If you think that's.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Do that.
Me: It's more likely to be controlled.
Them: Well, let's do that then. So Bing becomes. Zero.
Me: Yeah.
Them: For P9. So we'll just pause all that, Just keeps it simple.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: And that means that Google for PD9 becomes 171963, so 17 2.
Me: Right. I'm back where I was then, right? Okay.
Them: Yeah. So that means we're taking a 12 overspend. We're taking 9 off Google and 3 off thing.
Me: Y. Eah. Okay? So that doesn't so where where we are then with. So I've got total spend 171 in the in the projection.
Them: Cool. Yeah.
Me: So we'll come in on budget revenue of 809,9500. So that's with a an optimistic budget, an optimistic ROAS of 4.73. The only way. The only way we could hit. The. Expected revenue is by increasing roas to 6.56.
Them: Well, I think it's a month of two halves, isn't it?
Me: Wow. What I've got is seven days. Seven days of cyber week. So this is looking at conversion rates from last year.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Then mid December. Plus the diaries. For seven days. Potentially, then four days, where at that point that Europe and the rest of the world stop. I need to put that final little bit in. We got three days of the finishing off for the US. And then Christmas, four days. Boxing Day. Three days of Boxing Day up to Boxing day and the 26, 27, 28th. So I've got a. I've got a budget in there for those that varies. So the next seven days I got eight and a half grands.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Mid December go to nine and a half grand, because that's when we're likely to get the best. Return. Mid month eigth of the 14th. And then, as I say, Europe and possibly rest of the world stop, and we can allocate some of the budget. To the the other campaigns, but there's not a great deal left then. So. Yes, it is. It is very much of two halves. We've got probably 14, 15, maybe 15 days. And then it kicks off again after Boxing Day. Very low level. Now, this is. These projections. I. I'll give you a. I'll give you a final version of this one. I know what the last order dates are. Because it's almost like Europe and rest of world just. Just stop them. Just, you know, people want this for Christmas. What's the point in spending everything on them?
Them: Yeah.
Me: I. I don't want to completely pause them, but I would just drop the budgets down to as low, as low as I could, just as a marker so that they do actually start again in the new year. But I'll be able to give you some. I'd be able to give you a better idea once I know when those last order dates. Are.
Them: Yeah, I'm just painting them in our chat now. I just needed confirmation.
Me: Nice.
Them: So you have 16th, 16th, 17th and 21st. I'd ignore the click and collect one. Because not really sounding relevant for local.
Me: Yeah.
Them: People to slow.
Me: Just bear with me while I just paste this into.
Them: So we probably want, which I'll. Happy to add in close to the time. Adding some site links, I suspect just drop them in to say order by.
Me: Y.
Them: But I can drop those in. To your sheet for you.
Me: Ep. Sure.
Them: To outline.
Me: Not a notch. Not in the sheet that's still got the acid text in. That's just aspect. If you put anything else in there.
Them: Oh, okay. I just put them in the account. Then.
Me: Just. Just ping them over to me, that's fine.
Them: Okay? Okay?
Me: No. Well, I know what they are. I can put. I can stick those in. Yeah, that's not a problem.
Them: Okay. Yeah, fine. Yeah. So I think we can probably put them.
Me: That's not.
Them: In? Well, whenever, really. I guess. Couldn't we? Because we're in the cinema.
Me: I can't. I can. Yeah, I can schedule them in. That's not a problem.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, let's get. Yeah, let's get them in after tomorrow. So this week, I guess. One quick question. I was just doing some analysis on the performance. In google glance. Insights and reports. Search terms.
Me: Any particular account.
Them: No. Whichever one you fancy. I'm in the UK at the minute.
Me: Okay?
Them: I'll just share as well so you can see where I'm running around. So I just want to look at non brand terms, performance of non brand terms for the last week. So I've put a filter on. Says campaign name does not contain brand. Date filters last seven days, and then it gives me this search term report. Obviously this brand times in there. But is this a fair way of analyzing. What terms? Are doing better than others. So, for example, best notebooks.
Me: Well, it depends what you what you're going to use it for.
Them: It's just an update to say, because obviously, when I'm looking at. Traffic.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Non brand traffic in the UK for paid search was up on the year. So you see this highlighted row? Non brand Traffic is up 52%.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: I'm not trying to explain all of that 52%. I'm just trying to give a flavor of what were some of the better performing. Non brand. Terms that we picked up for last week.
Me: The Oxy question is. Probably. Let me just. Yes. Yes is the answer.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It won't give you everything, but if you just want a flavor of it, then, yes, it will do. The only reason. The only reason I'm cautious is because you've got search shopping and PMAX in there.
Them: Okay? Yeah, so I'm just looking at. Go on.
Me: And I was just checking. They do. They do all actually show in there. Now, you won't get everything if you added all those search terms up.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Me: The number of clicks and then looked at what it was for the whole account. They weren't equal each other. They just don't. And that's just good. Google don't want you to know everything. You know?
Them: No, that's fine. I don't want it to be mathematical. I just want to kind of say. Because obviously we know the brown ones. Myosin Smythins, blah, blah, blah. So I just want to kind of see what are the trends from the non branded terms that we're seeing. So best notebooks.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Jewelry box, leather, men's backpack.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: If I sort it by conversion value, for example. Two purses. I mean, I don't know who they are, but that's, you know, men's other card holder. It's just that get a flavor of. Okay, what are people searching for that is being picked up by our ads and what's converting. So I've just searched by assorted by conversion value.
Me: Yeah. Yep.
Them: And just picked out a couple of the ones that don't have the word smarter than it, to be honest.
Me: Yep. Oh, some Belters. Absolute Belters. It's. You know, we saw that the other day about the. Looking at Brown against non brands and how it's improved. Obviously. The non branders we've seen is more expensive. But then new customers.
Them: Yeah. So it's an interesting stuff that comes up, to be honest.
Me: It's going to be very interesting when this is all done and dusted and we're in a bit of a calm time is to do some analysis on. On. Brand non brand and see whether we've been getting a new custom data out of this as well. Is that new customer? Sorry I'm jumping around, but is that customer match data still being uploaded? You know that's CSV file.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Them: Yeah, I checked it about two weeks ago.
Me: Right. Great.
Them: Because I. I wasn't sure, but it's been tiny. Done by. The separate team.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: They're just the sheets connected to ads, and they're just uploading the the Delta every week.
Me: Fantastic. That's good. Especially now, it's really, really important right now that we get that, that data, right? We might be able to get some, some information about new customers, because you can actually.
Them: Yeah.
Me: New versus returning. Last seven days. Total account. Right. Let me show you this. Again. This is. This is going to be for afterwards. I'm just disappearing at my own today. You know, they've been Cyber Monday. This is one of those, isn't it? Right. Okay.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I'm looking at campaigns.
Them: Right.
Me: Let me show you that. So that's the uk campaigns. If you go to segment. And. Conversions.
Them: Yeah.
Me: New versus returning. Okay, so now it's giving you a segment. So you got unknown, new and returning. So I think they're self explanatory. Unknown would be Google have no idea who these people are. So it's going to put them in and unknown bucket. They could have cookies set. They could be, you know, they don't interact, whatever it is. Or they could be. They could not have a Google account.
Them: Yeah. Okay?
Me: So if you go to important to go to this here really total account. You can see I've got this conversions here in this and column. So if you come down to unknown 384unknown. 482 new customers and 102 returning customers.
Them: Nice.
Me: So the only bit you don't know is is the unknown. Which is why it's.
Them: Yeah, well, I mean, that's. They'll always be.
Me: Y.
Them: An element of that.
Me: Eah. I don't know whether you could construe that. If you had. If you looked at new customers against returning customers, in that. In that particular instance, you got 482 returning customers. For a related to new customers 102 returning customers. Does that mean that 80% of your, you know, could you extrapolate that out and say it's 80% of all the sales are coming from new customers? You say unknown out of it completely and just do it as a ratio. You know, why. Why wouldn't. Why would new customers like to do an unknown or a new. And is it the same ratio to returning an unknown? But at least it gives you a starting point. I think it's a. I think it's a fantastic figure. And I just pinged you an email over the other day about. It is Salesforce you use, isn't it?
Them: Yeah, I did see that in man on the Weekend, actually.
Me: Right, so what I've. What I've got is, and I'm doing this for, for all my customers is I can plug into the API now. Of their ecommerce system. And do some more analysis on it. So actually, you know, do a proper analysis on, we're saying, say for instance, on, on Google, as you said, we've sold X number of this product.
Them: Yeah.
Me: How does that reflect through on your system of how many you actually sold away? What percentages out of that are there, Are there particular products on your admin system you're selling shed loads of. And we're not selling anything on Google Ads. It's gonna, it's gonna identify some opportunities so that that's just a few little bits and pieces about what could potentially do with it. And it's only read only access. It's not. It's not right at all.
Them: No, it's fine. I'm just gonna. While I want to call this. Forward it to bear. Who's in charge of this stuff? I'll put you in copy.
Me: Okay? Fantastic. Thank you. Again. This is going to have to be after. Christmas, I think. Unless it's.
Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Me: Giving me some great insights. Now, on on customer data.
Them: You'll see that in copy in a sec. Just simply.
Me: Wonderful. Thank you. So, yeah, that's. That's. I think that's one of the wins from the last few months, at least. The. The number of new customers that are coming through. The only downside is that there's no actual KPI for that in the business yet. As to what percentage that needs to be, and also there being an allowance in the marketing spend for that.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And that's the thing. It's. It's always a bit like any sort of awareness campaign. It's always the first thing that gets knocked on the head as soon as there's a bit of pressure on sales targets. It becomes, you know, don't worry. You know, just someone buy something from somewhere. Annoyingly.
Me: But it would be nice to actually come back to the business and say, what about lifetime value? You know, if we'd somehow we can do some analysis on lifetime value, especially if it's. If we could identify that it's a Google Ads customer coming through. Don't know whether you can or not. Then that would justify doing a cpa target rather than I know the roas target.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
Me: We can dream.
Them: Was I last week? Was I only working in the one sheet? The post Black Friday, Black Friday activation list sheet. There wasn't two sheets, were there for, like, assets and text.
Me: There's a. There's an rsa one.
Them: I'm bloody. Find it. I know I've saved it.
Me: Should be in the chat.
Them: Problem is I've got so many folders for each subject to look after, but then in the actual folders, It's a fucking mess.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah, I've got. The shared special.
Me: Sorry. I was going to say, that's another thing you never go back on and go, oh, let's just. Step back from this and let's just tidy everything up.
Them: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I've got it.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I've got it. Yeah. Right. Let me just put one of this PPC and put it in the top. Okay, so in terms of where we're at, Just want to jump over to the stuff from tomorrow, then I think.
Me: You saw that thing about the one image ad in the. The one image in the pmax. Pmax asset group.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, the lowest one now is.
Me: Great stuff.
Them: Four.
Me: So it needs to be. There needs to be a landscape and a square. It doesn't need the portrait. But, you know, if you've got one banger in.
Them: Yeah. I might take about these a bit more when they're live, but I'm just looking across. Yeah. So in terms of the post Black Friday activation, this sheet, so the PMAX stuff.
Me: Yeah.
Them: They're all filled in now. Us, uk, rest of the world, Europe. So.
Me: Brilliant. Thank you. Well, I'm going to drive on those again today. I've done it four times already, but I'm going to dry run it again. Just make sure they all go in.
Them: That's. Yeah. So that's headlines, long headlines, descriptions and image asset ids all done.
Me: Wonderful. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.
Them: Now. I know. It's fine. It's good, actually. I don't mind. I quite like getting back into. Always get a bit worried. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like staying away from it for too long because then you end up forgetting where stuff lives.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Them: The only in terms of rsas post black Friday. I'm pretty much happy with uk us. And rest of the world.
Me: Y.
Them: So I've just changed the color of the tabs. The green once they're good.
Me: Eah. Yep.
Them: Europe. The only ones I haven't touched are the translated ones. You'll see some gaps on the Europe tab.
Me: I don't. I don't think there are any that were Black Friday, to be honest.
Them: Yes, I took all the tuple away. Anything related to 30% in Black Friday out. But what. I don't know if we ever not we. But I'm not sure if Lauren ever saved down.
Me: No. She didn't.
Them: So I might just arrange for them to be. Worked on this week.
Me: Okay?
Them: Yeah. Otherwise, that's mostly done. So I think we're in terms of assets and text and imagery, I think we're fine for tomorrow. The main thing will be. Once you've. I guess from probably Wednesday, I'll start working on the promo.
Me: Okay?
Them: So are you happy for me to drop in? One to two headlines. Per country. And. For the rsas and for the pmax.
Me: Yeah, sure, yeah.
Them: We don't need to piss about too much. I think I'll pretty much just. Replace a couple of what might be. The weakest ones with the up to 20% off whatever it is we're going to call it.
Me: Okay?
Them: Might replace one description. For example, I'll probably just highlight where the changes have been made.
Me: Yeah, that'd be good. Yes. He's not bothered about the colors in the background. It is just going to take the text. So if you do that.
Them: Yeah, I thought. I thought. Yeah. I thought it's much better. At least the colors we can kind of see, which. Is where we're at. And then you can always just put it back to black and white when using.
Me: Yeah. And all I need is for you to just to wait until everything's in, till I give you the go ahead.
Them: Yeah. So if you're changing it tomorrow, I'll wait till Wednesday anyway.
Me: Yeah. Cool.
Them: And then is that same process again with the assets. I will probably just add. The because we've got room on almost all of the pmax campaigns to add in. Just. I'll add them in as additional images. For the 20% off.
Me: Yeah, yeah.
Them: But. Because then we can just take them straight back out again.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Cool. All right, that's fine. So.
Me: If you wanted to color code it, that they're the ones that are going to come out.
Them: Yeah, I think I might do. Yeah. So I'll put everything back to. I'll reset it now that all the stuff that's done, and maybe I'll just keep the tabs green. So that's all good for tomorrow. And then I'll just highlight what the promo ones are. And then we know exactly what to take back out.
Me: Yep.
Them: After the promo.
Me: Okay?
Them: Cool. Okay, so now it goes. I think we're in a good place. For tomorrow.
Me: If it works.
Them: Yeah, that's on your head. I've sat there for six hours on Friday putting all the testing.
Me: I'm. Gonna. Oh, I'm gonna be shitting myself, I really am. It's. I've. I've tested it so many times. I got so many rollbacks on it. Sony backups, and it's. It's unbelievable. But there's still going to be that bit where you just go, okay. I've actually got into another customer and changed some of their RSAs. And asset groups using the same process just to make sure it works.
Them: If you. I'll be on the train tomorrow morning from like, seven, so. If it all goes peaked on just WhatsApp me. And then when I see your name appear on my phone, I'll know not to look.
Me: Sure. I'm going to WhatsApp you then. Go what may.
Them: Cool. I hope we got a good process here, though. This will be all right. This will work.
Me: Yeah, it's just getting it working. It's. As I say, it's a. It's a new kind of concept. I've had to jump through hoops trying different things out with Google, but it would, it will be a good thing if it works, to roll forward because it's like you. Know, taking Christmas off and stuff, you can just go straight into there and just change it, you know, It's. It's.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's easy enough to do. There's still some in there that aren't sentence case.
Them: Oh, no. It is. Yeah. Yeah, I did see some. But then, interestingly, what I thought was odd was when you go into Google Ads itself and you. I don't know. Go into a PMAX asset group and look at headlines. When they give you examples, they've got it capitalized still.
Me: I know. And that's the confusion with it all. You know, there's stuff I sent you through the other day. The analysis is just third party analysis on what's working and what's not.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Working. So would it make much difference? I don't know.
Them: No. Well, what I've done is. For this. For now, I've kept it with the status quo. So I just followed what was the most. Yeah, if it was capitalizing the sheet, we'll just keep it capitalized for now.
Me: Okay?
Them: Rather than have me put the new ones in is like sentence case, and then it's going to mix or capitalize ones. I'd rather just all one way or the other way. And for now it's all capitalized, which is fine.
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. I mean, within, within ads editor, you can actually just go pick the assets and just say change it to sentence case. But then you have to remember, okay, well, what is uppercase? Is Panama uppercase?
Them: So names and stuff? Yeah.
Me: Yeah. On street. You know, all those bits and pieces. What. What is actually supposed to be uppercase and what isn't, which has never had to be decided before. But if we had it, if we had a translation list between the two of them, it would make it. You know, it would make it easier to do.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But again, losing sleep over it.
Them: Just come. Nine. No, no, no. I think it's just consistency either way.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Just so one way or another, it's. It's either that or this.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay, cool. What else did we have that. Oh. What did you reckon on the. Competitor RSA then for the uk. So I saw it was about three and a half. Row s. Obviously it's not really doing much in terms of. It spent 250 quid in the last seven days.
Me: Let me have a look.
Them: It's. Not. It's not stinking the place out.
Me: No.
Them: But equally, it's. I'll do an update to Seb on it anyway.
Me: There's only one conversion with the search term on it as well. Which is annoying. Also me doesn't track everything. It's. It's Aspen. All that has, actually. Converted.
Them: Yeah. So we stole one customer.
Me: Like 710 ROAS as well, which is really annoying. Because it's actually quite good. Two pound fifty one average cpc. I. I just. I just. Well, you know what I think? I just think takes up so much time for something that's so irrelevant. And he's not going to make us an absolute fortune.
Them: Have we got them? I'll. Yeah, I'll see what he says then. In at 2:00. If we got any in the us. EU and rest of the world that we could just pause because I think I saw.
Me: The us has got one. Or not.
Them: Yeah, because we can definitely save money there. I mean, it's not. I think Lauren has set them up.
Me: Hing. Live.
Them: Oh, no, that's paused. Well, I'm falling fine.
Me: Yeah, that was. That was. I don't know when that was, but it has been paused.
Them: Okay? That's cool.
Me: Yeah. I think the main thing for me is just managing your expectations. There's no way we're going to hit the revenue target. I'm the most positive guy in the world as far as these can things concern me. It's just not going to happen. It really is not going to happen.
Them: We just need lips from other channels. That's a. Hang on.
Me: I think so. Yeah, I think so. You know, we've given it the best shot, but. Hindsight. Don't spend the money at the beginning of the month. It has been one of the most phased things ever over the last week, I suppose, but it was. It's a case of waiting until the conversion rate was good. It's like we're going to do now the first two weeks of December to spend more there than we do in the last two weeks in December.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, no one's. You really do. Fall off a cliff. I think there's a week where. You just will not set anything and get probably from like. Probably from, like,
Me: The 15th, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. 15th to the 23rd will be slow. There's a bit of last minute, but obviously us and the rest of the world switch off first and in Europe follows and then it is just the uk, so it does drop down.
Me: Yeah. I mean, this budget is really extreme because those last three days, maybe from. The 21st, maybe till the 20eigth. It's going to have about £300 a day budget. That's it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, because, I mean, no one's going to. Be. We're not going to be converting anyone, are we, at that stage?
Me: And they, they're traditionally, you know, we go, we go from a 4.8. Roas last year for this this week down to a 4 and a 3.5 over that Christmas period. So, you know, there's no point in spending money then when you're not going to convert as well.
Them: No. And then we've got, I think, five weeks of sale from the 24th.
Me: Yeah, we should be driven by email.
Them: Yeah. Oh, there's a lot to do in that.
Me: It's. It's nuts this time of year. It really is. As you.
Them: Please. Well, yeah, yeah. I'm just pleased the two bits I don't have to. Well, I still have to look after, but I don't have to. Go in and build stuff is paid, social and email.
Me: Yes.
Them: Thankfully, I've at least not two people that. Can do that for me.
Me: Yeah. As a full time job. That's the funny bit.
Them: Well, this is what I kind of thinking about digital marketing. It's like every. Because, like my peer who looks after the website, It's a very general role, so, you know, moving stuff around, looking at the search terms and the page speed, so, like, all of you can be experts in the whole thing. Whereas with the digital marketing side, There's such different like SEO to email to paid search paid so they are expertise in themselves. And there's no way you can.
Me: When I first started client side, I did all of them. In fact, back in 2000, they did all of them. So for 10 years, it's like doing SEO affiliates, email. You know, the price comparison engines, all that, all that kind of stuff. But especially SEO. I mean, it's just a. A dark art. You know, because if you ever say to someone, ask. Yeah? Why is that not appearing? Well, I changed it a week ago. It take three months to take effect. All right. Okay. And they're hoping that you're going to have forgotten influence time that you asked them to do it. So it's. It's not for me. I see how anymore.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Especially when you're now getting into Chat GPT as well. You know where you need. Did you. Did I send you that stuff on the LLM txt file? I presume that was. I think you said you took that to the SEO guys.
Them: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Me: Cool.
Them: Yeah, so I just got a new. Consultant on board last week. First year.
Me: Right.
Them: So that's on my full time, but they weren't really. Were we needing them to be?
Me: You are a hardship manner. Aren't you?
Them: I know, I know. My mother in law said that to me yesterday. She said, how many have you got now? I said, what? At my career?
Me: It's very. So when you start buying stickers on your computer, that's when you start worrying.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, I know. So I've just gone with. Yeah, I've gone with an old consultant. That I've worked with just to.
Me: Right.
Them: Because interestingly, the UK SEO like organic searches in the mud.
Me: Right.
Them: But we're not doing anything. But the US Is growing. But we're not doing anything.
Me: Okay?
Them: So I think I figure that one out. Like how on earth is how we grow in one market organically, but not the other. But we're not doing anything one either.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Search shadow. Unravel it all and you end up just saying yes. It's the financial situation at the moment that's doing it.
Them: 70 ads.
Me: Yeah, because you've no idea, really. You know, it's.
Them: No, everything is a huge pinch of salt as well.
Me: Yeah, I've got one. Luxury branded crap over Black Friday. Absolutely awful. And yet it's the people with the money who don't, who are normally not affected by it. But certainly not this time.
Them: There never seems to be enough people with the money that want to spend.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Interestingly enough, European. Spend. Was down on the we master pump some money in last year. We spent nearly 13 grand last week last year.
Me: Gosh, I really pushed Europe as well because it was doing very well.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. We spent 13 on paid social. 12 and a half. Sorry. 13 on paid search, 12 and a half on raid social. However. This is where it's weird. Revenue plus 102% for 32% less spend.
Me: Overall.
Them: So total paid channel revenue.
Me: Buddy. Oh. Is that on target, though?
Them: Now it's minus five to the target. But +102 last year.
Me: Right.
Them: So.
Me: That's a result. So there were more ambitious this year on the targets than last year.
Them: Yeah, well, you gotta. It's because. I mean, I don't know, obviously I'm not involved in the conversations. At the top, but. There it was, you know, they wanted growth year on year. But it was never quite clear. It was almost like just someone you're not just figure out. Where it's coming.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: So you got to put the numbers in some way to make it add up. It's what they get paid the big bucks for.
Me: Yeah, definitely. Definitely.
Them: Them. Oh, there you go. Best come back. All your boots. To that. She said, Sami, Because I don't know what it means.
Me: I'll ask claude. Nice. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. That is brilliant. Right.
Them: All good.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, that's fantastic. So that was all the bits I'd asked for.
Them: I hope so. She's normally quite switched on.
Me: Well, she's in. I've got an email from her now. If I need anything, I just. I'll. I'll CC you in on it, but. Yeah, I'm sure.
Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, by all means. No, but it's. That's. That's her world. She knows what she's talking about there. I don't have a clue what. What she talks about half the time.
Me: Okay?
Them: But she's good, all right. I'll. Jump off. Well, if there's nothing else, I do try and do another quick call before, too, but.
Me: Sorry. The ad extensions. Very quickly. The ad extensions are all scheduled, so you might see them in there, but they're not going to show after today. For black Friday.
Them: Oh, okay. Perfect. Yeah.
Me: But yeah, so it's fingers crossed for tomorrow. There's shitloads of backups, mate. I'll drop it all down into Google. That adds editor as well. So if the worst comes to worst, I just fire everything back in and straight as it is. There's no. There's no risk. I just want it to work right. First time for my own.
Them: Well, yeah, because then we know we're in a good place then, don't we? No, that's fine. I'll. Just see if someone's putting like, a meeting for 9 o'clock tomorrow. Go away.
Me: It'd be lone. Ly.
Them: Thank you. I didn't even ask for it as well. From Meta. No, thanks. Yeah, I'll obviously jump on. I've got a half nine. I've got a 9 and a half, 9, a 10, a half, 10, 11. So at some point, if I'm lucky, there might be a gap and I'll just get on and just do some front end checks.
Me: Brilliant. All right.
Them: And, like, yeah, just as a. As a glance, just to see it.
Me: Okay? Just double check. Just give me a heads up when the RSA is to be done today just so I can.
Them: But yeah. Yeah, I'm just gonna. I just want to double check all the links and stuff and make sure there's nothing else that. So I might just do an hour this afternoon and I'll come back before the end of the day. We've got a paid search. Catch up in for tomorrow 11. We don't need that, do we?
Me: Okay? Well, that. That was. I think that was the one that Lauren had set up, wasn't it? So.
Them: Yeah. You're happy doing this? Monday one, Then we'll.
Me: Mate. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, it gives me enough time to have a look at things. I just need to try and make sure it actually goes into my diary now, because it's not doing so. But yeah. Cool.
Them: Delete that. There you go. So I can check stuff at 11 now? It's taken one out. Good stuff. All right. Well, yeah, give me a shout on teams as any other bits you need from me. Although, yeah, chat, you know.
Me: Do you get teams when you're out the office or do. Is it WhatsApp when you're out the office?
Them: I get the note, okay?
Me: You do all right.
Them: I'm fully, unfortunately, fully connected to this business, no matter where I go. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. No, I get. I get notifications on my phone, so that's fine.
Me: Okay?
Them: Nice one. Thank you. Cheers.
