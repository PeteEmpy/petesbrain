  - Account performance immediately improved after correction
  - Conversion rate increased back to proper levels
  - February-March performance was artificially suppressed due to dual tracking
- Current October baseline: 4.64 ROAS, 4.54% conversion rate
- November/December seasonal uplift projections:
  - 26% increase in November (5.74 ROAS)
  - 31% increase in December (5.95 ROAS)
  - Revenue projections based on historical performance patterns
- Budget allocation strategy by region:
  - US: 51% of spend
  - UK: 43% of spend
  - Europe: 3.3% of spend

- New gifting campaign structure:
  - Dedicated gifting keywords campaign
  - Separate PMAX campaign for gifts
  - Christmas-specific product groups based on new assets

  - Use Christmas messaging in sitelinks and promotion extensions instead
- Campaign preparation timeline: all changes ready by November 1st for phased budget implementation
