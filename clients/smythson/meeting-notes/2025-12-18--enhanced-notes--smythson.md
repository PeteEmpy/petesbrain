- 'Me: On it. All right.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah.'
- 'Me: I am there. You might not want to look at me, but. How''s it going? Mate.'
- 'Them: I''m all right. You.'
- 'Me: Yeah, just crisp. I''m all Christmas out already. We on the eigth of December.
  It''s just bonkers. So yesterday I decided these freaking assets. You know when
  you start something. And you go down a path and you get to a certain point, you
  go. This would have been quicker to do with a quill. And a piss parchment and send
  it off by carrier pigeon. But, you know, you''ve gone too far down the road and
  you''re building something for the future, but you are actually getting to the point
  and going, is this really worth it? That was Yesterday at about 9:00. Then five
  hours later, I found out there was actually an error in Claude. Jesus. So that had
  to do a work round. I finished about 8:00 last night. I watched Norris win the Grand
  Prix, which is amazing. But, yeah, life and hours.'
- 'Them: Wow.'
- 'Me: And then my sis wanted to go to. Sorry, I just. I''d have a moan, just for
  a second, if you don''t mind.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: This needed to go to the hospital this morning for an appointment. And that
  was I had to get her there for half past seven. I wasn''t going to give up my daily
  walk, I wasn''t going to give up my breakfast, I wasn''t going to give up my yoga.
  So I had to get up at quarter to six. So I am absolutely wasted. I''m also delaying
  because I''m just running a quick report for you while we''re up to. I''m just working
  on the image assets are being problematic at the moment. They''re not the end of
  the world. That''s why, you know, I''m working on them now. I''ll get them in as
  soon as possible. But they''re not the end of the world. They''re just in the PMAX
  and the RSAs. But the actual text is in the promotion. Extension''s done. The merchant
  center promotions are working.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So we''re up. We''re up and running. I''m going to give you a shout. Might
  not be today, might be tomorrow. Where to let you know that the spreadsheets are
  ready for the next stage up in the 14th, so it might just be case we just take that
  bit out. But I''m going to reload them. So we''ve got a position where.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Me: It''s clean. It reflects exactly what''s in Google Ads. So one thing that''s
  come to my attention is that once that spreadsheet''s in, we can''t really change
  anything. We can''t change campaign names. We can''t change asset group names or
  anything. We''re going to leave it exactly as it is. Otherwise it won''t match.
  But whatever. So I''ve just run a report. So we''re sort of like P9 phase three
  now. So the problem last week, or the challenge last week, was to pull the budgets
  down without knackering it. We didn''t do too bad.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: We''re overspending on the UK budget, which is understandable. Anyway, to go
  from that massive point of Black Friday down to where it is at the moment and then
  bring it back again for the sale.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Is a challenge, to say the least. The roas is above target. We''re on 482 for
  P9, which is above where we wanted to be. I''m going to just get together a report
  for you. That just gives you a better something that you can present to the powers
  that be as to where we''re up to. But that''s basically it. We''re going to be under
  that target, mate. There''s absolutely no way, no how.'
- 'Them: No, that''s fine. As I say, It''s. If there are areas of the business were
  doing well or better, then there''d be more of a conversation around. Let''s spend
  some more. But we could spend another 50 grand. But it''s not going to change the
  fact that stores are down. So then ultimately the whole business is down anyway.'
- 'Me: And they''re bringing the bulk of the budget, of the money.'
- 'Them: So. Big. Yeah. Yeah. So we can''t over perform our target and their target.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: To get where we need to be. So it''s almost like, well, let''s just do what
  we can with what we got.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I think. I think the part of the debrief will be. Actually looking next
  time at doing this in August. You know, what''s the budget going to be? What''s
  the plan? Doing a marketing plan going forward. Doing it sensitively.'
- 'Them: Well, this. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I mean, even something as simple as changing these tax has just been a nightmare
  because it''s. They''re all over the place. It''s. It. It wasn''t necessarily in
  a logical place. To do them all. So that, that''s something to work on for the future.
  But, yeah, I''m ringing it as much as I can, and I''m spending the money where they,
  where the, the, the roas is highest. You know, the, the Europe''s done particularly
  well. We''re on 745roas for Europe. The only one that''s underperforming, really,
  is the UK. 3. 73. The US is on 608, rest of the world''s on 501, so total is 4 82.
  But of course, the UK is a big percentage of that, so it does, it does drag it down.
  So. Yeah. So the plan is to spend some money this week. Then the week after, just.
  Let''s just see what we''ve got left. I think it''s been impossible to actually
  say, this is definitely what''s going to happen there. This is definitely what''s
  going to happen there. It''s looking at how the budget ebbs and flows, gives you.
  If you push your budget up to five grand one day, then bring it down to one grand
  the next day. Then Google''s saying, well, you, that''s, that''s five grand over
  30 days. So that''s six grand over 30 days. So let''s, let''s split that out. You
  know, that''s, that''s how much it''s going to be. It doesn''t just go, that''s.
  An absolute amount of money that you can spend. So it''s like, I liken it to. If
  you imagine you were in a balloon and you wanted to go up, you go and like that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then you wait 30 seconds, then it starts to go up. And it''s the same when
  you come down. You know, you let it out and it''s still. I know it''s not quite
  like a boom, but all steering a big tanker as well. It just takes a long time for
  this steering to go.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I need a. I need something in between the tanker and the balloon analogy.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But, yeah, I''ll. I''ll pink something over to you as soon as I can. Just you''ve
  got something to. To present. So I''ve not got. I haven''t. I don''t really have
  a number for you yet. As to what we''re likely to hear. Oh, projected P9 revenue
  8, 8, 6. So that will be 21 below the target.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. You know what? As I say, it is what it is.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I don''t think. The amount of money that we''d have to spend in order to.
  Come in on target. The rice for that?'
- 'Me: 50 grand.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And I don''t. I don''t know whether it''s too late anyway.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Well, this is it. And the other thing that, because it gets absorbed
  into one view now is we''ve actually got. We''ve got an additional 39 that we''re
  using this month anyway. So.'
- 'Me: Right. Right. I mean, I''ve got. I''ve got one eight. Three. 1-833-929 I''m
  working on.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So we had to reduce it last week to one certain 1-963 because of our
  12 overspend from last. So I''ve got zero spending bing for this month.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So of the 12. Overspend. Three of it''s going to be covered by Bing because
  everything''s paused.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then 9 of it needs to be covered by Google.'
- 'Me: So I''ve got to come down to 174.'
- 'Them: 11172.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Because if I take, if I ignore that 9. Yeah.'
- 'Me: You''re right, mate. No, you''re right.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You''re right. I. I literally did this five minutes before we came on, right?
  Are you right?'
- 'Them: No, it''s fine. I mean, this is why these meetings are good, because.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah. So the new. The new p9. Budget is 17 2.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I''m just going to ping in our chat. Just the view that I''ve got.
  So we''ve got the same.'
- 'Me: 1-7-1963. Okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So 117 2. That takes into account nine of the 12 overspend. And then,
  as I say, the remaining three, I''ve just put Bing to zero.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay? Yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: Cool, so. Okay. Yeah, I mean, text ads and stuff. Front ended, looking good.
  And actually, I don''t know if it''s just a bit of luck. In terms of what I''m served.
  But it works quite nicely the text ads that I''m seeing, because we haven''t.'
- 'Me: A skill adjustment, mate. It''s not. Look.'
- 'Them: Spaffed. 20 everywhere.'
- 'Me: Good.'
- 'Them: It reads quite nicely. Listen to ones I''ve seen.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Well, I''ve got smice and a Bond street headline one. Enjoy. 20 off. And
  Sunday.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Cool.'
- 'Them: Just nice and easy, that''s all. I.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. And it. And it will. The thing is, Google likes shiny new things,
  as we all do. And if it sees a new headline, especially if it''s in off there and
  it. And if you, if you, if you couple that up with the promotion extension as well,
  which says it''s a Christmas offer. 2020 off selected. Gifts. A 20 off selected.
  There''s no. There wasn''t enough room to put it all in there. The. The merchant
  center ad will do the same thing. It''ll say that there''s a, There''s a promotion
  on. So we''ve, we''ve, I think we''ve got it covered. I say it''s just a bit frustrating
  not getting the images on, but they''ll, they''ll back it up today. But they''re
  just tiny. The. Images. You know, all those search. Those searches you''ve done
  have got very few images actually next to them and they''re 20 off. You probably
  can''t read anyway. But, yeah, I think. I''m just pleased with it. Up and running
  by the time the powers that be start to. Search on the Internet at 8:00 in the morning
  when they''re having the breakfast, so.'
- 'Them: Know. I mean, Sep. I saw your message as I was looking for the gym this morning.
  And then I saw seb. About 8:00. I just got back and the code wasn''t working. So
  someone had caught that up on. The e. Commerce team.'
- 'Me: The code.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So someone had not set it up properly. On the website side.'
- 'Me: It wasn''t a code.'
- 'Them: Yeah.gif20.'
- 'Me: Like you said, that I''ve not set these up as a code. Right. These aren''t.
  These aren''t set up as a go. It''s going to make absolutely difference because.'
- 'Them: Well, they''re going to see the offer.'
- 'Me: You see it on the site?'
- 'Them: Yeah. So as long as the skus match, that doesn''t really matter.'
- 'Me: Yeah. But. But you have to put the code in to get the 20% off.'
- 'Them: Because. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that''ll be on every product. It will say.'
- 'Me: I don''t know how, but I''ve missed that completely. I. I didn''t realize that
  was a code.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So on the site. Let me just show you quick. So say they come through
  an RSA or whatever.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Or for a sponsored product. Oh, no, that''s no good for you, is it? On bloody
  screen. That one is what you want. So they come from. They come for an ad anyway.'
- 'Me: All right. Okay. Can you click on one of those products?'
- 'Them: They''ll see this.'
- 'Me: Then.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Ignore the 40. That''s because I''ve got staff discount. So that''s what
  they''ll see.'
- 'Me: Isn''t that funny? So Google. Google. Look at that and go, that''s fine. You
  don''t need a code for that because it''s seen a strike through on the price.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Hang on, let me show you.'
- 'Me: But if you add that to your bag now.'
- 'Them: Let me do it this way because it''s. That. Okay, so what you saw with the
  strike first, because my staff discount overrides it.'
- 'Me: I. See?'
- 'Them: So. That''s what this. See there? So it almost doesn''t really matter whether
  the ad says. With code. Like my RSA text doesn''t say with code. It just says there''s
  20% off.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Them: End of Sunday. And then when they come, all the messaging on the site is
  20% off. GIF 20. So that''s everywhere. So they can.'
- 'Me: I think we''ve. We''ve conned. With Con Google here, which is quite good. So
  I wonder what the ad looks like then. See the the 20% off selected GIFs is working.
  Wow. And the uk is a 921 roas today.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so, like, there. That''s. To me, that is the ideal, and that''s probably
  what I pin.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Because as soon as they click through, it''s going to say, use code. So that''s
  fine. And all of these sponsored products.'
- 'Me: I mean, it''s true, isn''t it? Oh, there we go. Look at that.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: And look at that. It''s got the. It''s got the. The strike through on. There.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so that''s fine. Because as soon as they go through to that product,
  It will be full price, but. But it''s odd because. If Google was to scrape our site,
  they''ll see that at full price.'
- 'Me: Yes, they were. But I''m pushing through in the merchant center. What the.
  No, I''m not. I''m. I''m not pushing through the merchant center. The sale price.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: You don''t have a show handy, do you? Or just a name of that. What''s that?
  Block backpack.'
- 'Them: So that''s the equivalent. Yeah, Tiger Norton or something similar.'
- 'Me: So title? Norton. Sorry. Yeah. There''s now a sale price. Wow. All right, I''ll
  keep an eye on it, mate. And if if needs be, I can just whack it in there. That''s
  actually worked out really well, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, so that''s fine. So they click through that sponsored product
  and then obviously they won''t see the discount of one that they saw. On the shopping
  ad.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But they''ll see 20% off a GIF code gift. 20.'
- 'Me: You''ve been upfront about it. I mean, it''s they. They proposition is on the
  page, isn''t it? But you could buy that for 1,150, couldn''t you?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, you could. Yeah. Yeah, if you were. If you ignored. All of the.
  See, look at that. Even that. That.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: ''s just what''s nice. Is all of this stuff as well, which is more brand,
  brand, brand, brand, and then brand with the offer.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: Rather than, I mean. I think internally. We cocked up a bit on the text on
  Black Friday. On my side. I don''t think it should have been.'
- 'Me: Fall in your face.'
- 'Them: No, but it should have been in there. But. Saying up to 30% off in four headlines.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Fell into a pier. One after the other, they just look. Oh, they''re still.'
- 'Me: Well.'
- 'Them: There.'
- 'Me: That''s not a sponsored ad. Oh, yes, it is.'
- 'Them: Yeah. They haven''t gone away.'
- 'Me: Well, that''s a bit naughty. They''ve not that. ''s from Google''s perspective,
  they''re not actually making a big deal of a sponsor results there, are they? It
  used to be by the side of the actual wording, it would say it was a sponsored result.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: They''re pissing money away, though, mate. That''s a good thing. And you look
  at. See, the thing is, you look at the real estate you''ve got there. You''ve got
  that big wedge at the top. With all the site lengths, you''ve got all the products
  on the side until about number six. If someone''s looking for the brand, they''re
  gonna. They''re gonna find it. You know, they''re not. They''re hardly going to
  be direct.'
- 'Them: Well, I mentioned this. I mentioned this to. Set again, and he was just like,
  no, keep it on.'
- 'Me: He might be getting pressure from above, though. It''s. Sometimes we''ve got
  to spend this money to keep the, to keep the, the, the, the people in power happy,
  don''t we? And if it''s 50 pound a month,'
- 'Them: Well. I think it is the case because. They''re kind of saying, well, what''s
  happening to the additional budget? And he''s saying, well, it''s been, you know,
  a lot of it goes into brand because, yeah, the brand CPCs are up, the brand costs
  are up because we''re doing, you know, because Aspanol have decided that they''ve
  got nothing else better to do than just. Been on smice and terms.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: It''s a nice non brand. Search terms coming through for last week. Though.'
- 'Me: Good.'
- 'Them: Some more. You know, like luxury Christmas cards. 2026 diary.'
- 'Me: Nice.'
- 'Them: Jewelry box.'
- 'Me: That''s the thing now, isn''t it? Is whether the diaries are going to start
  to. To really kick in.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, I think that''s what Seb said, actually. I mean, Just fine. The
  last from him. So, yes, today. We were up 25% on forecast, up 35 on last year, and
  it was mostly diaries. Which is good because the offer this week doesn''t have any
  diaries in. No. It''s not like we''re sold to a load of people for price stuff,
  but now it''s in the offer.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And apparently the US Was pretty good on Saturday and Sunday as well.'
- 'Me: Well, from my perspective, the pmax Diaries is shit. It''s awful. 2:37. So
  whether it''s too soon. Don''t know. The us. Brandon+diaries565 that''s very good.
  Pmax diaries 9:46. But we''re only spending 29 quid on it. Just if only. You hate
  leaving stuff on the table, don''t you?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Just going to do. It''s just doing a little bit of rejiggling.'
- 'Them: Just notice. And we''re picking up papier the the stationery brand through.
  Looks like heroes and psychics shopping is picking up. That at a term we can probably.'
- 'Me: I can''t really do much about it, to be honest. The negs on on pmax. I think
  if you did an analysis.'
- 'Them: Well, that''s Paul was anywhere.'
- 'Me: Is what, three?'
- 'Them: Oh, sorry. I just realized that''s paused.'
- 'Me: You. You''ll be getting the odd thing like that. It''s. It''s 10% spend on
  PMAX is on research.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Apparently.'
- 'Them: I just saw Smy UK shop in here as a psychics.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Then I went to go and have a look at that campaign, but it looks like it''s
  paused anyway. So that must be a recent.'
- 'Me: Uk pmax, h&s.'
- 'Them: No uk shop in h and s. So if you look in the UK for last week, it was the
  second highest spending campaign.'
- 'Me: Let me just have a look. Some of these. It''s been. The spend won''t come down
  quick enough, so I''ve actually paused some. Yeah. Shopping. I''ve literally just
  done that. So that''s 305.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: 305 roas the last seven days. So what I''ve done is I''ve. I''ve moved the
  spend from there. 282 to the PMAX campaign.'
- 'Them: How does interest. So. How does shopping determine what terms it can trigger
  for like, if you just had a standalone shopping campaign on its own.'
- 'Me: Well, if you think even with pmax, pmax is shopping and search. So you mentioned
  the two separate parts. There are other bits and pieces in it, but the shopping
  part of it and the shopping part of the shopping campaign looks at your merchant
  center. So it looks at the headlines and they''re titled in the description from.
  From Merchant center, and it determines what keywords it thinks should actually
  fire off for that product. So there are processes you can go through and optimize
  your titles and descriptions. So that they''re better for shopping.'
- 'Them: Right, so less control than search, for example, you can say, I just want
  to pay for exactly this, and then I''ll shop ins. More akin to pmax then, in the
  sense that there''s less control over exactly what it fires for.'
- 'Me: Correct. Yeah. And again, as I say, pmax Shopping is part of pmax as well,
  so it''s the same for that. But pmax also doesn''t have keywords for search.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So that uses your pages. So it''ll look at your pages and say, I think the
  keyword for that one should be that. And it''s like the old style DSA campaigns,
  dynamic search ad campaigns. So it will look at the page and go, I think. I think
  you should be firing for this. And over time, it''ll optimize when things don''t
  work. But you can for both of them. What you can do is you can make sure that your
  page itself. Looks good. It''s got the right. They''ve got the right keywords on.
  It''s got big descriptions. But then you can also do the same on Merchant center.
  And I''ve done it. Product Hero has a facility where you can actually pass it through
  headlines and titles and descriptions that it''s optimized.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So it''s not like it''s not quite keyword stuffing. It''s still got to look
  right, but you can actually optimize them. And that only affects the ads. It doesn''t
  affect anything on the site at all. You can still keep the look and feel of the
  website, but you can change those titles and descriptions going through to the shopping
  ad. So if you click a shopping ad, it does expand out a little bit, doesn''t it?
  You know, you can actually put some pieces on it. And it''s all down to how near
  the front of the title are the words. How near to the front of the description,
  the words. Because as a human being, that''s the thing that absolutely describes
  it. So if you were to do smice and luxury leather, diary.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I would put diary luxury leather smisen.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Because it puts more emphasis on the emphasis on the. On the physical product
  in the fact that it is actually a diary.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And if someone''s looking for diary, that''s where they''re going to go. So
  it''s just about optimization. But it''s not something I would want to rush. I have
  done it. Some of the products, but not all of them.'
- 'Them: No, that makes sense. So I guess that''s. Yeah. So that. That explains, kind
  of why shopping last week picked up papier.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Because obviously,'
- 'Me: You could look at those spelling.'
- 'Them: Yeah. No, it''s interesting. What, it. What it pulls up. I mean, we''re still
  getting, I think Aspen or London. Where it was. One, two, three. Fifth. Non brand
  search term.'
- 'Me: Right. Really? And is it converting?'
- 'Them: For clicks. No, I tell you. The ones with the highest conversion, most amount
  of conversions. It''s not a huge amount of data in this, but. It''s quite long.
  Search terms, note cards with envelopes, leather emboss, notebooks. Diary. Luxury
  bookmarks, I think Christmas cards.'
- 'Me: Well, we''ve got.'
- 'Them: Those are ones in super conversions on Aspinall as a search term.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, in the. In the pmax campaign. Last seven days for aspen. All we''ve
  got. It''s a four. It''s a 400 roas. So, you know, I was lucky that they were spending
  on average. I can''t see what they were. So cost per conversion 57.45. So they''re
  spending money when they''re coming through. But it''s only 13 clicks and 1,500
  impressions and you''re paying 8 pound 84 average CPC. The actual. The actual. That''s
  ridiculous. You''ve got two clicks on the word aspinal from one of the asset groups
  and it''s 34 pound 50 average CPC. And it converted. So that''s the power of Google.
  So those would you ever pay 34 pound 50 for a click? The answer is yes, because
  it brought you in a ROAS of 662%. Because its audience driven.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It knew that those people were going were likely to convert, so it was willing
  to pay more for them. That''s an incredible stat. That is absolutely incredible.'
- 'Them: It''s a proper engine, isn''t it? All of that.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. Quite scary, really.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s two clicks and two conversions.'
- 'Them: So it''s. Yeah. So some good stuff. So I''ll probably pick up the stuff that''s
  got the clicks this week. Really? Because it''s more relevant, I think, like jewelry,
  box diaries, fashion, Christmas cards. That''s the sort of stuff they want to hear.
  So that''s all kind of working nicely.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. I''ve done a.'
- 'Them: And then it''s just a rush to the delivery dates now.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: The last delivery list.'
- 'Me: I did a quick Brown versus Non brand for another client the other day, which
  is quite interesting, so that''s another analysis to do. Where I can just. I''ll
  pull the search term report. For the whole site for a whole period, and then I can
  do a brand versus non brand on it. And you can see then what the ROAS is, what the
  CPCs are and so on. That should be quite an interesting project.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. What else have we got? Yes, obviously. Run this for each so tomorrow.
  Or Wednesday. I''ll go through. Do you know you made a copy of that text assets
  sheet? I don''t think we need that. Because sometimes in my mind, because I go through
  all of those tabs. And I change anything that''s out of date or wrong, and I swear
  I go through again. Only a few hours later, and I''m like, how did I not see that?
  But it was wrong. That bit was wrong. So I think now the current live document.
  That''s got the promo stuff in as well. That is the most up to date.'
- 'Me: I''m going to change the name of it. I''m going to put the word live at the
  end of it. There you go.'
- 'Them: Version. Yeah, I nearly did.'
- 'Me: There we go. It''s in.'
- 'Them: That''s the most. Valid version. What I''d love to do, just for my sort of
  OCD brain, is have Joan. You''ve got repeating headlines.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Is to have all of them, all of the ones that repeat in a nice little order
  so over 135 years is always in this column.'
- 'Me: Big.'
- 'Them: And then any of your, like, more individual ones are at the end.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: That''s where I want to try and just get the house in order a little bit.'
- 'Me: Be dead easy. Yeah, it would be Denny doing that. I can''t. I don''t. I after
  yesterday. Let''s leave that till after Christmas.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ox, We''ve got loads. Yeah. So I think we''ll
  probably. Wednesday, I''ll go back to, like, the full price Christmas thing. So
  I''ll go through all of those, update all the images, texts across all markets.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So that from Monday morning next week, we are. Fully back Christmas, full
  price.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I will probably chuck in. Process wise. I''m just thinking. Site link. Or
  a headline. For last delivery dates.'
- 'Me: Yes. Site link.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but for a site link for lasted every dates. And I just chucked them
  in the accounts. And then they''ll get delayed. They''ll just take them out next
  week or take them out once the date''s gone past.'
- 'Me: So for the site links for last order date. Great one. Because it''s a time
  limitation, so it''s going to, it''s going to force people to, to, to order a bit
  sooner if you add them as a site link.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: At account level. Then we can put an expiry date on it and it''ll come off
  anyway.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So there''s this. You can put a start date on and an end date for it.'
- 'Them: That''s good.'
- 'Me: And if you want to. I mean, I don''t mind doing it if you want to do it. And
  just tell me when you''ve done it and I''ll go and have a look at it.'
- 'Them: So I do account level. Fine. Yeah, I''ll give you a shout. It probably. It''d
  probably be the same and I''ll get round to it, I think, but. I''ll count level.
  And we just stick all the stick order dates in an expiry date, and then we''re good.
  Okay, that''s fine, because they''re not far off anyway. I mean, it''s only. Last
  chance. Us is next week.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Last chance to use next week. And then Last Chance UK is at the end of next
  week.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Okay, fine. That''s. That''s good. We''ll get those in as well. And then
  it''s a case of. Redoing those sheets for phase one of sale.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: So again, I''ll have. If I just take care of all the assets and images and
  stuff across all the markets, and I''ll let you know when it''s all good.'
- 'Me: I really appreciate that. Thank you. I feel like I''m. I feel like I''m a puppeteer
  at the moment, doing the budgets, you know, because things are changing so quickly.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Well, the way I see it is I''d rather. Pay you for your time. For doing
  stuff that''s worthy of your level. Do you know what I mean? Rather than you having
  to go in.'
- 'Me: I. Don''t know.'
- 'Them: And cop it.'
- 'Me: What? You want a cup of tea? Then? Okay.'
- 'Them: You know, to have you on board. I don''t want to waste your time.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I know what you mean.'
- 'Them: Copying and pasting text. It''s. That''s not.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: I mean. Respectfully, anyone can, you know. So if it''s just a case of four
  hours of doing that, it''s better off me doing that and letting you focus on optimizing
  the accounts.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. You were also putting the business spin on it. That, to me, is
  the most important thing is it''s. It''s business knowledge you''re putting into
  it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, you. You know what''s going on there. What''s important, so.'
- 'Them: Well, it''s all the isms, isn''t it? And the last little minute changes over
  the desk. And I can just go in and just sheet rather than meet. They tell me. Me
  tell you. You do it. You send it back to me. Yeah, so.'
- 'Me: Cool. Yeah.'
- 'Them: I''ll handle that stuff. And then I think we''ll. If you''re happy, we''ll
  use the same approach as we are for this, for the sale. I''m not going to obliterate
  it.'
- 'Me: Good.'
- 'Them: And obviously you have to take out all of the. Kind of gifting stuff, so
  it''ll be kind of sales. You know, luxury goods and take all the Christmas gifting,
  messaging out, but it''s, it''s going to be a similar level of text. Either. Yeah.
  There''s no point. Kind of.'
- 'Me: What do they what are the hidden downsides to blasting it all with the text?
  Like the, like the Black Friday one is the fact that you''re actually taking out
  keywords that are relevant to the search terms that people are putting in. So that
  that''s twofold. One is that it it messes up with click through rate.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because people aren''t seeing irrelevance in, in what they''re seeing. And
  the other thing it messes about with your, your quality score for the ad, which
  is the thing really, if your quality is still suddenly comes down from high to,
  to average, you suddenly pay more for you for your clicks because Google going,
  that''s not relevant to, to what people are searching for. So it increases the CPCs.
  So, but when you first look at it, you can''t, you can''t go, oh, you categorically,
  it''s gone down from that to that because you changed that. We are getting to that
  stage now where I will be able to provide that source of information as to is is
  giving a root cause analysis which includes where the, where the quality score is
  of the, of the keyword. So we have to keep those in. You know, we can''t. We can''t
  just. That''s why we don''t have just a template of just, like, all the same ones.
  They have to be specific towards that product. But the more PMAX campaigns you have,
  the more asset groups there are, the more RSAs you have, people are less likely.
  To do it because it''s a bol like to actually change them. And that''s where I think
  we''re going to get a real big win. Coming up where there can be nuanced add text
  for everything. You know, the whole purpose of creating loads of asset groups is,
  is your. One thing is you''re creating relevant assets towards that product, and
  secondly, relevant audiences who want to find that product.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, people. We can''t put the same audience group in all the time because
  it''s not smise and stationary. Well, what happens if you want to buy a bag? I''m
  looking for a bag. Oh, you only do stationery. So Google won''t actually point people
  at the ads, so we have. To get more granular, but to do that, you have to have the.
  The stuff in the background to be able to manage it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. No, it makes sense. And I think, like you say, You know, appearing
  for, you know. Luxury leather bounds or whatever. And then people seeing the. Oh,
  there''s a sale on.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So we''ll go down a similar route and just kind of.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: It''ll be in there, across all of them. And then my assumption. I mean, the
  obvious assumption would be that the ones that appear, the headlines that appear
  with the sale messaging in, will have a higher click through. Therefore they''ll
  show more often.'
- 'Me: For it? Yes. Yeah, if they, if it floats their boat, if they''re of the demographic
  that''s gonna. That''s going to be more likely to click through, which is most people.
  I get it. But if it said, you know, luxury leather bags save 20%, yeah, that''s.
  That''s the message, isn''t it? But we don''t have to Suddenly go otherwise. 50%
  luxury leather bags and 50 off. There''s all the rest of it as well.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know that that adds value to it all.'
- 'Them: No cool. Fine. So I think.'
- 'Me: This sale is that boxing day?'
- 'Them: What? In terms of start date.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Christmas Eve, and it''s normally between four and six. Yeah, somewhere between
  four and six.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So obviously I''ll have all the. All the assets and bits updated way before
  then.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: It doesn''t take you long to dip to upload them into.'
- 'Me: It''s the same as this.'
- 'Them: The okay.'
- 'Me: Is it. This is why I''ve got it. I''ve got to really, today, absolutely focus
  on getting those image assets. Updated. It''s incredibly complicated. To say the
  least, because you got 15 images in there. So. So you say, or what you do? Do you
  take them all out first and then put the 15 in? Well, you can''t do that because
  Google said there''s not enough images and it''ll blow up. You can''t add them in
  because you''re only allowed 50. Sorry, it''s 20. You can''t add them in because
  you go over the 20. So it''s actually taking one out. Put one in, take your one
  out. Put money. If you do that manually, you know, you or I would put them. In.
  In a little slot, they''d be easy, but Google''s not finding it particularly easy.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. It''d be nice if it was kind of like. Update and replace, wouldn''t
  there? So if every. If. If it matches an asset ID that already exists in there,
  ignore if it''s a new one.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Replace it.'
- 'Them: Replies.'
- 'Me: Yeah, and that''s what''s missing. There''s no replace. You got to remove and
  add.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So, yeah, it''s. In fact, it''s been running while we''ve been talking and
  it''s said again, it''s going to be tricky. I don''t care. The language was ripe
  yesterday. He was. I actually said to you, really up there, didn''t you? And it
  just went, yes, you''re correct. I fucked up, which is.'
- 'Them: Well, worst case. Comes to shove, I''ll just chuck them in. Bob''s r weight.
  For your update.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. As you say. Give me till Wednesday, probably Wednesday
  afternoon. To make sure I''ve got it all boxed off. I''ll reload the that sheet.
  I might, I think. I''m going to put in that sheet, it''s called Smite and Add Text
  Assets Live. I''m going to put updated on such and such a date and the time so that
  you know. You know absolutely that it''s the right one and then you can just go
  nuts with it then.'
- 'Them: Okay, perfect. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Big validation process that takes place when it''s once you''ve put your stuff
  in to make sure there''s enough images. Make sure the text to the right length and
  all that kind of stuff as well.'
- 'Them: Cool. And I''ve also got some, like, full price. Stuff for Europe. When this
  comes back off a promo.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So that should be good. Wondering if I might have to go through and do all
  the images. Just thinking when I update to take the promo stuff off, I''ve got no
  way of knowing which ones were the promo image assets.'
- 'Me: You can search on image ID within Google.'
- 'Them: Have I?'
- 'Me: If you go to tools, asset studio and asset library, I think.'
- 'Them: Just do a control f, take the asset. The landscape ones dirt control F on
  the sheet.'
- 'Me: Yeah. It says asset id. Whether that.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so actually correspond to the sheet and then I could just do a find
  and remove.'
- 'Me: I''m sorry it''s such a pain. I. I was trying to make it simple. I actually
  did a. A search facility, but it''ll only work locally. I can''t put it onto an
  external server to run it.'
- 'Them: No, that''s fine. I like to take a couple of hours to do. Probably. Yeah.
  Cut that as half a day to do most of those, so that''s cool. And then the primary
  text are easy because I''ll just do a control F for anything with 20% in.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Bin those off. I''ve saved the load of the stuff that I took out. So I''ll
  put that back in.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: And I have. I did do quite a bit of UNC capitalizing. That''s the right way
  to say it. Uncapitalized and stuff.'
- 'Me: So just a word of warning I said before about the asset groups. There was a
  couple of asset groups where the word diaries had been changed to an uppercase from
  a lowercase. I don''t know whether it''s me, but it just put the ads into a weird
  place where they shouldn''t have been.'
- 'Them: From upper too lower or lower to upper?'
- 'Me: It was from lower to up. It didn''t matter either way. It just sees it as a
  different asset group name.'
- 'Them: Oh, Asset group names.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it''s probably melting you. I don''t think you''d add
  any reason to change it, but.'
- 'Them: All right. Oh, no. Yeah, no, I misheard you. I don''t. Yeah, no, I just tend
  to play with the headliner subscriptions. But. Okay, that''s good to know that.
  I didn''t actually realize they were. Okay. Well, that''s a. That''s a good one
  for me to, anyway.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So if you put, for example, stationary, if I was to change that to a lowercase
  stationary, that that becomes a new asset group with a new asset group id. Ask you
  now.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Didn''t realize that was.'
- 'Me: That''s a raw data you''re looking at.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, fair enough.'
- 'Me: There''s many, many customers I would not trust this with.'
- 'Them: Good to know. Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, it''s funny. It''s like a. It''s like an ongoing project because
  I could actually just protect those cells.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: And just so you know, you just can''t touch them at all. And just. Just keep
  ones that you can change.'
- 'Them: As I say, I didn''t even think I''d go over that side. If I did this, I''m
  It''ll probably have been where they''re finding replacement state, but otherwise
  I''ll just freeze up to row D so that when I scroll across, I''ll know which asset
  groups I''M and otherwise I just change the ones that have headlines, descriptions,
  etc.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Good. One thing I did notice, which I''ve done, is that the. UK
  and US ones looks likely different. They got a different number of headlines and
  descriptions. Because, look, I''ve got eight long headlines on the uk, pmax, the
  usp, Max. When they don''t, I''ve just deleted them now. They didn''t need to be
  that many. So that was a Another little hiccup. And 22 headlines, which is rubbish.
  No, there is no longer that many.'
- 'Them: Seems to go. This seemed to be an easier way of working than. Black Friday.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, I just. It would just be just another couple of weeks on this and
  it would have been nailed. It''s just trying to see the fog through the fog at the
  moment. Because it is. It is. It is important to get it done. Because it''s that
  this is like, your last little 1% effort. That a lot of people don''t bother doing
  because it''s a pain in the ass. And this is the one that makes the difference.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I just noticed there. There''s actually headline 16. Yeah. There''s only actually
  15 headlines around. Okay? Right. Well, I''ll get that. I''ll get the rip. Just
  a quick summary for you. I''m going to create this for this week based upon where
  we are at the moment.'
- 'Them: Yeah, perfect.'
- 'Me: Have a think what we''re going to do next week. I''ll download. The assets
  to where the art at the moment, and I''ll give you a shout when they''re done. And
  I''m going to adjust it all. So we''re using that budget of 171. Because that''s
  going to make a big difference as well. Okay?'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Me: On it. All right.
- Them: Oh, yeah.
- Me: I am there. You might not want to look at me, but. How's it going? Mate.
- Them: I'm all right. You.
- Me: Yeah, just crisp. I'm all Christmas out already. We on the eigth of December. It's just bonkers. So yesterday I decided these freaking assets. You know when you start something. And you go down a path and you get to a certain point, you go. This would have been quicker to do with a quill. And a piss parchment and send it off by carrier pigeon. But, you know, you've gone too far down the road and you're building something for the future, but you are actually getting to the point and going, is this really worth it? That was Yesterday at about 9:00. Then five hours later, I found out there was actually an error in Claude. Jesus. So that had to do a work round. I finished about 8:00 last night. I watched Norris win the Grand Prix, which is amazing. But, yeah, life and hours.
- Them: Wow.
- Me: And then my sis wanted to go to. Sorry, I just. I'd have a moan, just for a second, if you don't mind.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Me: This needed to go to the hospital this morning for an appointment. And that was I had to get her there for half past seven. I wasn't going to give up my daily walk, I wasn't going to give up my breakfast, I wasn't going to give up my yoga. So I had to get up at quarter to six. So I am absolutely wasted. I'm also delaying because I'm just running a quick report for you while we're up to. I'm just working on the image assets are being problematic at the moment. They're not the end of the world. That's why, you know, I'm working on them now. I'll get them in as soon as possible. But they're not the end of the world. They're just in the PMAX and the RSAs. But the actual text is in the promotion. Extension's done. The merchant center promotions are working.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So we're up. We're up and running. I'm going to give you a shout. Might not be today, might be tomorrow. Where to let you know that the spreadsheets are ready for the next stage up in the 14th, so it might just be case we just take that bit out. But I'm going to reload them. So we've got a position where.
- Them: Yeah. Okay?
- Me: It's clean. It reflects exactly what's in Google Ads. So one thing that's come to my attention is that once that spreadsheet's in, we can't really change anything. We can't change campaign names. We can't change asset group names or anything. We're going to leave it exactly as it is. Otherwise it won't match. But whatever. So I've just run a report. So we're sort of like P9 phase three now. So the problem last week, or the challenge last week, was to pull the budgets down without knackering it. We didn't do too bad.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: We're overspending on the UK budget, which is understandable. Anyway, to go from that massive point of Black Friday down to where it is at the moment and then bring it back again for the sale.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Is a challenge, to say the least. The roas is above target. We're on 482 for P9, which is above where we wanted to be. I'm going to just get together a report for you. That just gives you a better something that you can present to the powers that be as to where we're up to. But that's basically it. We're going to be under that target, mate. There's absolutely no way, no how.
- Them: No, that's fine. As I say, It's. If there are areas of the business were doing well or better, then there'd be more of a conversation around. Let's spend some more. But we could spend another 50 grand. But it's not going to change the fact that stores are down. So then ultimately the whole business is down anyway.
- Me: And they're bringing the bulk of the budget, of the money.
- Them: So. Big. Yeah. Yeah. So we can't over perform our target and their target.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: To get where we need to be. So it's almost like, well, let's just do what we can with what we got.
- Me: Yeah. I think. I think the part of the debrief will be. Actually looking next time at doing this in August. You know, what's the budget going to be? What's the plan? Doing a marketing plan going forward. Doing it sensitively.
- Them: Well, this. Yeah.
- Me: I mean, even something as simple as changing these tax has just been a nightmare because it's. They're all over the place. It's. It. It wasn't necessarily in a logical place. To do them all. So that, that's something to work on for the future. But, yeah, I'm ringing it as much as I can, and I'm spending the money where they, where the, the, the roas is highest. You know, the, the Europe's done particularly well. We're on 745roas for Europe. The only one that's underperforming, really, is the UK. 3. 73. The US is on 608, rest of the world's on 501, so total is 4 82. But of course, the UK is a big percentage of that, so it does, it does drag it down. So. Yeah. So the plan is to spend some money this week. Then the week after, just. Let's just see what we've got left. I think it's been impossible to actually say, this is definitely what's going to happen there. This is definitely what's going to happen there. It's looking at how the budget ebbs and flows, gives you. If you push your budget up to five grand one day, then bring it down to one grand the next day. Then Google's saying, well, you, that's, that's five grand over 30 days. So that's six grand over 30 days. So let's, let's split that out. You know, that's, that's how much it's going to be. It doesn't just go, that's. An absolute amount of money that you can spend. So it's like, I liken it to. If you imagine you were in a balloon and you wanted to go up, you go and like that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And then you wait 30 seconds, then it starts to go up. And it's the same when you come down. You know, you let it out and it's still. I know it's not quite like a boom, but all steering a big tanker as well. It just takes a long time for this steering to go.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I need a. I need something in between the tanker and the balloon analogy.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: But, yeah, I'll. I'll pink something over to you as soon as I can. Just you've got something to. To present. So I've not got. I haven't. I don't really have a number for you yet. As to what we're likely to hear. Oh, projected P9 revenue 8, 8, 6. So that will be 21 below the target.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. You know what? As I say, it is what it is.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I don't think. The amount of money that we'd have to spend in order to. Come in on target. The rice for that?
- Me: 50 grand.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And I don't. I don't know whether it's too late anyway.
- Them: Yeah. Well, this is it. And the other thing that, because it gets absorbed into one view now is we've actually got. We've got an additional 39 that we're using this month anyway. So.
- Me: Right. Right. I mean, I've got. I've got one eight. Three. 1-833-929 I'm working on.
- Them: Yeah. So we had to reduce it last week to one certain 1-963 because of our 12 overspend from last. So I've got zero spending bing for this month.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: So of the 12. Overspend. Three of it's going to be covered by Bing because everything's paused.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And then 9 of it needs to be covered by Google.
- Me: So I've got to come down to 174.
- Them: 11172.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Yeah. Because if I take, if I ignore that 9. Yeah.
- Me: You're right, mate. No, you're right.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You're right. I. I literally did this five minutes before we came on, right? Are you right?
- Them: No, it's fine. I mean, this is why these meetings are good, because.
- Me: Y. Eah. So the new. The new p9. Budget is 17 2.
- Them: Yeah, I'm just going to ping in our chat. Just the view that I've got. So we've got the same.
- Me: 1-7-1963. Okay.
- Them: Yeah. So 117 2. That takes into account nine of the 12 overspend. And then, as I say, the remaining three, I've just put Bing to zero.
- Me: Yeah. Okay? Yeah, no problem.
- Them: Cool, so. Okay. Yeah, I mean, text ads and stuff. Front ended, looking good. And actually, I don't know if it's just a bit of luck. In terms of what I'm served. But it works quite nicely the text ads that I'm seeing, because we haven't.
- Me: A skill adjustment, mate. It's not. Look.
- Them: Spaffed. 20 everywhere.
- Me: Good.
- Them: It reads quite nicely. Listen to ones I've seen.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Well, I've got smice and a Bond street headline one. Enjoy. 20 off. And Sunday.
- Me: Yeah. Cool.
- Them: Just nice and easy, that's all. I.
- Me: Yeah, yeah. And it. And it will. The thing is, Google likes shiny new things, as we all do. And if it sees a new headline, especially if it's in off there and it. And if you, if you, if you couple that up with the promotion extension as well, which says it's a Christmas offer. 2020 off selected. Gifts. A 20 off selected. There's no. There wasn't enough room to put it all in there. The. The merchant center ad will do the same thing. It'll say that there's a, There's a promotion on. So we've, we've, I think we've got it covered. I say it's just a bit frustrating not getting the images on, but they'll, they'll back it up today. But they're just tiny. The. Images. You know, all those search. Those searches you've done have got very few images actually next to them and they're 20 off. You probably can't read anyway. But, yeah, I think. I'm just pleased with it. Up and running by the time the powers that be start to. Search on the Internet at 8:00 in the morning when they're having the breakfast, so.
- Them: Know. I mean, Sep. I saw your message as I was looking for the gym this morning. And then I saw seb. About 8:00. I just got back and the code wasn't working. So someone had caught that up on. The e. Commerce team.
- Me: The code.
- Them: Yeah. So someone had not set it up properly. On the website side.
- Me: It wasn't a code.
- Them: Yeah.gif20.
- Me: Like you said, that I've not set these up as a code. Right. These aren't. These aren't set up as a go. It's going to make absolutely difference because.
- Them: Well, they're going to see the offer.
- Me: You see it on the site?
- Them: Yeah. So as long as the skus match, that doesn't really matter.
- Me: Yeah. But. But you have to put the code in to get the 20% off.
- Them: Because. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that'll be on every product. It will say.
- Me: I don't know how, but I've missed that completely. I. I didn't realize that was a code.
- Them: Yeah. So on the site. Let me just show you quick. So say they come through an RSA or whatever.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Or for a sponsored product. Oh, no, that's no good for you, is it? On bloody screen. That one is what you want. So they come from. They come for an ad anyway.
- Me: All right. Okay. Can you click on one of those products?
- Them: They'll see this.
- Me: Then.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Ignore the 40. That's because I've got staff discount. So that's what they'll see.
- Me: Isn't that funny? So Google. Google. Look at that and go, that's fine. You don't need a code for that because it's seen a strike through on the price.
- Them: Yeah. Hang on, let me show you.
- Me: But if you add that to your bag now.
- Them: Let me do it this way because it's. That. Okay, so what you saw with the strike first, because my staff discount overrides it.
- Me: I. See?
- Them: So. That's what this. See there? So it almost doesn't really matter whether the ad says. With code. Like my RSA text doesn't say with code. It just says there's 20% off.
- Me: Yeah. Okay?
- Them: End of Sunday. And then when they come, all the messaging on the site is 20% off. GIF 20. So that's everywhere. So they can.
- Me: I think we've. We've conned. With Con Google here, which is quite good. So I wonder what the ad looks like then. See the the 20% off selected GIFs is working. Wow. And the uk is a 921 roas today.
- Them: Yeah, so, like, there. That's. To me, that is the ideal, and that's probably what I pin.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Because as soon as they click through, it's going to say, use code. So that's fine. And all of these sponsored products.
- Me: I mean, it's true, isn't it? Oh, there we go. Look at that.
- Them: So.
- Me: And look at that. It's got the. It's got the. The strike through on. There.
- Them: Yeah, so that's fine. Because as soon as they go through to that product, It will be full price, but. But it's odd because. If Google was to scrape our site, they'll see that at full price.
- Me: Yes, they were. But I'm pushing through in the merchant center. What the. No, I'm not. I'm. I'm not pushing through the merchant center. The sale price.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: You don't have a show handy, do you? Or just a name of that. What's that? Block backpack.
- Them: So that's the equivalent. Yeah, Tiger Norton or something similar.
- Me: So title? Norton. Sorry. Yeah. There's now a sale price. Wow. All right, I'll keep an eye on it, mate. And if if needs be, I can just whack it in there. That's actually worked out really well, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, so that's fine. So they click through that sponsored product and then obviously they won't see the discount of one that they saw. On the shopping ad.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But they'll see 20% off a GIF code gift. 20.
- Me: You've been upfront about it. I mean, it's they. They proposition is on the page, isn't it? But you could buy that for 1,150, couldn't you?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, you could. Yeah. Yeah, if you were. If you ignored. All of the. See, look at that. Even that. That.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: 's just what's nice. Is all of this stuff as well, which is more brand, brand, brand, brand, and then brand with the offer.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: Rather than, I mean. I think internally. We cocked up a bit on the text on Black Friday. On my side. I don't think it should have been.
- Me: Fall in your face.
- Them: No, but it should have been in there. But. Saying up to 30% off in four headlines.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Fell into a pier. One after the other, they just look. Oh, they're still.
- Me: Well.
- Them: There.
- Me: That's not a sponsored ad. Oh, yes, it is.
- Them: Yeah. They haven't gone away.
- Me: Well, that's a bit naughty. They've not that. 's from Google's perspective, they're not actually making a big deal of a sponsor results there, are they? It used to be by the side of the actual wording, it would say it was a sponsored result.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: They're pissing money away, though, mate. That's a good thing. And you look at. See, the thing is, you look at the real estate you've got there. You've got that big wedge at the top. With all the site lengths, you've got all the products on the side until about number six. If someone's looking for the brand, they're gonna. They're gonna find it. You know, they're not. They're hardly going to be direct.
- Them: Well, I mentioned this. I mentioned this to. Set again, and he was just like, no, keep it on.
- Me: He might be getting pressure from above, though. It's. Sometimes we've got to spend this money to keep the, to keep the, the, the, the people in power happy, don't we? And if it's 50 pound a month,
- Them: Well. I think it is the case because. They're kind of saying, well, what's happening to the additional budget? And he's saying, well, it's been, you know, a lot of it goes into brand because, yeah, the brand CPCs are up, the brand costs are up because we're doing, you know, because Aspanol have decided that they've got nothing else better to do than just. Been on smice and terms.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: It's a nice non brand. Search terms coming through for last week. Though.
- Me: Good.
- Them: Some more. You know, like luxury Christmas cards. 2026 diary.
- Me: Nice.
- Them: Jewelry box.
- Me: That's the thing now, isn't it? Is whether the diaries are going to start to. To really kick in.
- Them: Yeah, well, I think that's what Seb said, actually. I mean, Just fine. The last from him. So, yes, today. We were up 25% on forecast, up 35 on last year, and it was mostly diaries. Which is good because the offer this week doesn't have any diaries in. No. It's not like we're sold to a load of people for price stuff, but now it's in the offer.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And apparently the US Was pretty good on Saturday and Sunday as well.
- Me: Well, from my perspective, the pmax Diaries is shit. It's awful. 2:37. So whether it's too soon. Don't know. The us. Brandon+diaries565 that's very good. Pmax diaries 9:46. But we're only spending 29 quid on it. Just if only. You hate leaving stuff on the table, don't you?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Just going to do. It's just doing a little bit of rejiggling.
- Them: Just notice. And we're picking up papier the the stationery brand through. Looks like heroes and psychics shopping is picking up. That at a term we can probably.
- Me: I can't really do much about it, to be honest. The negs on on pmax. I think if you did an analysis.
- Them: Well, that's Paul was anywhere.
- Me: Is what, three?
- Them: Oh, sorry. I just realized that's paused.
- Me: You. You'll be getting the odd thing like that. It's. It's 10% spend on PMAX is on research.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Apparently.
- Them: I just saw Smy UK shop in here as a psychics.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Then I went to go and have a look at that campaign, but it looks like it's paused anyway. So that must be a recent.
- Me: Uk pmax, h&s.
- Them: No uk shop in h and s. So if you look in the UK for last week, it was the second highest spending campaign.
- Me: Let me just have a look. Some of these. It's been. The spend won't come down quick enough, so I've actually paused some. Yeah. Shopping. I've literally just done that. So that's 305.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: 305 roas the last seven days. So what I've done is I've. I've moved the spend from there. 282 to the PMAX campaign.
- Them: How does interest. So. How does shopping determine what terms it can trigger for like, if you just had a standalone shopping campaign on its own.
- Me: Well, if you think even with pmax, pmax is shopping and search. So you mentioned the two separate parts. There are other bits and pieces in it, but the shopping part of it and the shopping part of the shopping campaign looks at your merchant center. So it looks at the headlines and they're titled in the description from. From Merchant center, and it determines what keywords it thinks should actually fire off for that product. So there are processes you can go through and optimize your titles and descriptions. So that they're better for shopping.
- Them: Right, so less control than search, for example, you can say, I just want to pay for exactly this, and then I'll shop ins. More akin to pmax then, in the sense that there's less control over exactly what it fires for.
- Me: Correct. Yeah. And again, as I say, pmax Shopping is part of pmax as well, so it's the same for that. But pmax also doesn't have keywords for search.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: So that uses your pages. So it'll look at your pages and say, I think the keyword for that one should be that. And it's like the old style DSA campaigns, dynamic search ad campaigns. So it will look at the page and go, I think. I think you should be firing for this. And over time, it'll optimize when things don't work. But you can for both of them. What you can do is you can make sure that your page itself. Looks good. It's got the right. They've got the right keywords on. It's got big descriptions. But then you can also do the same on Merchant center. And I've done it. Product Hero has a facility where you can actually pass it through headlines and titles and descriptions that it's optimized.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So it's not like it's not quite keyword stuffing. It's still got to look right, but you can actually optimize them. And that only affects the ads. It doesn't affect anything on the site at all. You can still keep the look and feel of the website, but you can change those titles and descriptions going through to the shopping ad. So if you click a shopping ad, it does expand out a little bit, doesn't it? You know, you can actually put some pieces on it. And it's all down to how near the front of the title are the words. How near to the front of the description, the words. Because as a human being, that's the thing that absolutely describes it. So if you were to do smice and luxury leather, diary.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: I would put diary luxury leather smisen.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Because it puts more emphasis on the emphasis on the. On the physical product in the fact that it is actually a diary.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And if someone's looking for diary, that's where they're going to go. So it's just about optimization. But it's not something I would want to rush. I have done it. Some of the products, but not all of them.
- Them: No, that makes sense. So I guess that's. Yeah. So that. That explains, kind of why shopping last week picked up papier.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Because obviously,
- Me: You could look at those spelling.
- Them: Yeah. No, it's interesting. What, it. What it pulls up. I mean, we're still getting, I think Aspen or London. Where it was. One, two, three. Fifth. Non brand search term.
- Me: Right. Really? And is it converting?
- Them: For clicks. No, I tell you. The ones with the highest conversion, most amount of conversions. It's not a huge amount of data in this, but. It's quite long. Search terms, note cards with envelopes, leather emboss, notebooks. Diary. Luxury bookmarks, I think Christmas cards.
- Me: Well, we've got.
- Them: Those are ones in super conversions on Aspinall as a search term.
- Me: Yeah. Well, in the. In the pmax campaign. Last seven days for aspen. All we've got. It's a four. It's a 400 roas. So, you know, I was lucky that they were spending on average. I can't see what they were. So cost per conversion 57.45. So they're spending money when they're coming through. But it's only 13 clicks and 1,500 impressions and you're paying 8 pound 84 average CPC. The actual. The actual. That's ridiculous. You've got two clicks on the word aspinal from one of the asset groups and it's 34 pound 50 average CPC. And it converted. So that's the power of Google. So those would you ever pay 34 pound 50 for a click? The answer is yes, because it brought you in a ROAS of 662%. Because its audience driven.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It knew that those people were going were likely to convert, so it was willing to pay more for them. That's an incredible stat. That is absolutely incredible.
- Them: It's a proper engine, isn't it? All of that.
- Me: Yeah, yeah. Quite scary, really.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That's two clicks and two conversions.
- Them: So it's. Yeah. So some good stuff. So I'll probably pick up the stuff that's got the clicks this week. Really? Because it's more relevant, I think, like jewelry, box diaries, fashion, Christmas cards. That's the sort of stuff they want to hear. So that's all kind of working nicely.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. I've done a.
- Them: And then it's just a rush to the delivery dates now.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: The last delivery list.
- Me: I did a quick Brown versus Non brand for another client the other day, which is quite interesting, so that's another analysis to do. Where I can just. I'll pull the search term report. For the whole site for a whole period, and then I can do a brand versus non brand on it. And you can see then what the ROAS is, what the CPCs are and so on. That should be quite an interesting project.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. What else have we got? Yes, obviously. Run this for each so tomorrow. Or Wednesday. I'll go through. Do you know you made a copy of that text assets sheet? I don't think we need that. Because sometimes in my mind, because I go through all of those tabs. And I change anything that's out of date or wrong, and I swear I go through again. Only a few hours later, and I'm like, how did I not see that? But it was wrong. That bit was wrong. So I think now the current live document. That's got the promo stuff in as well. That is the most up to date.
- Me: I'm going to change the name of it. I'm going to put the word live at the end of it. There you go.
- Them: Version. Yeah, I nearly did.
- Me: There we go. It's in.
- Them: That's the most. Valid version. What I'd love to do, just for my sort of OCD brain, is have Joan. You've got repeating headlines.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Is to have all of them, all of the ones that repeat in a nice little order so over 135 years is always in this column.
- Me: Big.
- Them: And then any of your, like, more individual ones are at the end.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: That's where I want to try and just get the house in order a little bit.
- Me: Be dead easy. Yeah, it would be Denny doing that. I can't. I don't. I after yesterday. Let's leave that till after Christmas.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ox, We've got loads. Yeah. So I think we'll probably. Wednesday, I'll go back to, like, the full price Christmas thing. So I'll go through all of those, update all the images, texts across all markets.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So that from Monday morning next week, we are. Fully back Christmas, full price.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I will probably chuck in. Process wise. I'm just thinking. Site link. Or a headline. For last delivery dates.
- Me: Yes. Site link.
- Them: Yeah, but for a site link for lasted every dates. And I just chucked them in the accounts. And then they'll get delayed. They'll just take them out next week or take them out once the date's gone past.
- Me: So for the site links for last order date. Great one. Because it's a time limitation, so it's going to, it's going to force people to, to, to order a bit sooner if you add them as a site link.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: At account level. Then we can put an expiry date on it and it'll come off anyway.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So there's this. You can put a start date on and an end date for it.
- Them: That's good.
- Me: And if you want to. I mean, I don't mind doing it if you want to do it. And just tell me when you've done it and I'll go and have a look at it.
- Them: So I do account level. Fine. Yeah, I'll give you a shout. It probably. It'd probably be the same and I'll get round to it, I think, but. I'll count level. And we just stick all the stick order dates in an expiry date, and then we're good. Okay, that's fine, because they're not far off anyway. I mean, it's only. Last chance. Us is next week.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Last chance to use next week. And then Last Chance UK is at the end of next week.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Okay, fine. That's. That's good. We'll get those in as well. And then it's a case of. Redoing those sheets for phase one of sale.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: So again, I'll have. If I just take care of all the assets and images and stuff across all the markets, and I'll let you know when it's all good.
- Me: I really appreciate that. Thank you. I feel like I'm. I feel like I'm a puppeteer at the moment, doing the budgets, you know, because things are changing so quickly.
- Them: Yeah. Well, the way I see it is I'd rather. Pay you for your time. For doing stuff that's worthy of your level. Do you know what I mean? Rather than you having to go in.
- Me: I. Don't know.
- Them: And cop it.
- Me: What? You want a cup of tea? Then? Okay.
- Them: You know, to have you on board. I don't want to waste your time.
- Me: Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Them: Copying and pasting text. It's. That's not.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: I mean. Respectfully, anyone can, you know. So if it's just a case of four hours of doing that, it's better off me doing that and letting you focus on optimizing the accounts.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. You were also putting the business spin on it. That, to me, is the most important thing is it's. It's business knowledge you're putting into it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, you. You know what's going on there. What's important, so.
- Them: Well, it's all the isms, isn't it? And the last little minute changes over the desk. And I can just go in and just sheet rather than meet. They tell me. Me tell you. You do it. You send it back to me. Yeah, so.
- Me: Cool. Yeah.
- Them: I'll handle that stuff. And then I think we'll. If you're happy, we'll use the same approach as we are for this, for the sale. I'm not going to obliterate it.
- Me: Good.
- Them: And obviously you have to take out all of the. Kind of gifting stuff, so it'll be kind of sales. You know, luxury goods and take all the Christmas gifting, messaging out, but it's, it's going to be a similar level of text. Either. Yeah. There's no point. Kind of.
- Me: What do they what are the hidden downsides to blasting it all with the text? Like the, like the Black Friday one is the fact that you're actually taking out keywords that are relevant to the search terms that people are putting in. So that that's twofold. One is that it it messes up with click through rate.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because people aren't seeing irrelevance in, in what they're seeing. And the other thing it messes about with your, your quality score for the ad, which is the thing really, if your quality is still suddenly comes down from high to, to average, you suddenly pay more for you for your clicks because Google going, that's not relevant to, to what people are searching for. So it increases the CPCs. So, but when you first look at it, you can't, you can't go, oh, you categorically, it's gone down from that to that because you changed that. We are getting to that stage now where I will be able to provide that source of information as to is is giving a root cause analysis which includes where the, where the quality score is of the, of the keyword. So we have to keep those in. You know, we can't. We can't just. That's why we don't have just a template of just, like, all the same ones. They have to be specific towards that product. But the more PMAX campaigns you have, the more asset groups there are, the more RSAs you have, people are less likely. To do it because it's a bol like to actually change them. And that's where I think we're going to get a real big win. Coming up where there can be nuanced add text for everything. You know, the whole purpose of creating loads of asset groups is, is your. One thing is you're creating relevant assets towards that product, and secondly, relevant audiences who want to find that product.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, people. We can't put the same audience group in all the time because it's not smise and stationary. Well, what happens if you want to buy a bag? I'm looking for a bag. Oh, you only do stationery. So Google won't actually point people at the ads, so we have. To get more granular, but to do that, you have to have the. The stuff in the background to be able to manage it.
- Them: Yeah. No, it makes sense. And I think, like you say, You know, appearing for, you know. Luxury leather bounds or whatever. And then people seeing the. Oh, there's a sale on.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Yeah. So we'll go down a similar route and just kind of.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: It'll be in there, across all of them. And then my assumption. I mean, the obvious assumption would be that the ones that appear, the headlines that appear with the sale messaging in, will have a higher click through. Therefore they'll show more often.
- Me: For it? Yes. Yeah, if they, if it floats their boat, if they're of the demographic that's gonna. That's going to be more likely to click through, which is most people. I get it. But if it said, you know, luxury leather bags save 20%, yeah, that's. That's the message, isn't it? But we don't have to Suddenly go otherwise. 50% luxury leather bags and 50 off. There's all the rest of it as well.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: You know that that adds value to it all.
- Them: No cool. Fine. So I think.
- Me: This sale is that boxing day?
- Them: What? In terms of start date.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Christmas Eve, and it's normally between four and six. Yeah, somewhere between four and six.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So obviously I'll have all the. All the assets and bits updated way before then.
- Me: Great.
- Them: It doesn't take you long to dip to upload them into.
- Me: It's the same as this.
- Them: The okay.
- Me: Is it. This is why I've got it. I've got to really, today, absolutely focus on getting those image assets. Updated. It's incredibly complicated. To say the least, because you got 15 images in there. So. So you say, or what you do? Do you take them all out first and then put the 15 in? Well, you can't do that because Google said there's not enough images and it'll blow up. You can't add them in because you're only allowed 50. Sorry, it's 20. You can't add them in because you go over the 20. So it's actually taking one out. Put one in, take your one out. Put money. If you do that manually, you know, you or I would put them. In. In a little slot, they'd be easy, but Google's not finding it particularly easy.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. It'd be nice if it was kind of like. Update and replace, wouldn't there? So if every. If. If it matches an asset ID that already exists in there, ignore if it's a new one.
- Me: Yeah. Replace it.
- Them: Replies.
- Me: Yeah, and that's what's missing. There's no replace. You got to remove and add.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So, yeah, it's. In fact, it's been running while we've been talking and it's said again, it's going to be tricky. I don't care. The language was ripe yesterday. He was. I actually said to you, really up there, didn't you? And it just went, yes, you're correct. I fucked up, which is.
- Them: Well, worst case. Comes to shove, I'll just chuck them in. Bob's r weight. For your update.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. As you say. Give me till Wednesday, probably Wednesday afternoon. To make sure I've got it all boxed off. I'll reload the that sheet. I might, I think. I'm going to put in that sheet, it's called Smite and Add Text Assets Live. I'm going to put updated on such and such a date and the time so that you know. You know absolutely that it's the right one and then you can just go nuts with it then.
- Them: Okay, perfect. Yeah.
- Me: Big validation process that takes place when it's once you've put your stuff in to make sure there's enough images. Make sure the text to the right length and all that kind of stuff as well.
- Them: Cool. And I've also got some, like, full price. Stuff for Europe. When this comes back off a promo.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So that should be good. Wondering if I might have to go through and do all the images. Just thinking when I update to take the promo stuff off, I've got no way of knowing which ones were the promo image assets.
- Me: You can search on image ID within Google.
- Them: Have I?
- Me: If you go to tools, asset studio and asset library, I think.
- Them: Just do a control f, take the asset. The landscape ones dirt control F on the sheet.
- Me: Yeah. It says asset id. Whether that.
- Them: Yeah, so actually correspond to the sheet and then I could just do a find and remove.
- Me: I'm sorry it's such a pain. I. I was trying to make it simple. I actually did a. A search facility, but it'll only work locally. I can't put it onto an external server to run it.
- Them: No, that's fine. I like to take a couple of hours to do. Probably. Yeah. Cut that as half a day to do most of those, so that's cool. And then the primary text are easy because I'll just do a control F for anything with 20% in.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Bin those off. I've saved the load of the stuff that I took out. So I'll put that back in.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: And I have. I did do quite a bit of UNC capitalizing. That's the right way to say it. Uncapitalized and stuff.
- Me: So just a word of warning I said before about the asset groups. There was a couple of asset groups where the word diaries had been changed to an uppercase from a lowercase. I don't know whether it's me, but it just put the ads into a weird place where they shouldn't have been.
- Them: From upper too lower or lower to upper?
- Me: It was from lower to up. It didn't matter either way. It just sees it as a different asset group name.
- Them: Oh, Asset group names.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's probably melting you. I don't think you'd add any reason to change it, but.
- Them: All right. Oh, no. Yeah, no, I misheard you. I don't. Yeah, no, I just tend to play with the headliner subscriptions. But. Okay, that's good to know that. I didn't actually realize they were. Okay. Well, that's a. That's a good one for me to, anyway.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So if you put, for example, stationary, if I was to change that to a lowercase stationary, that that becomes a new asset group with a new asset group id. Ask you now.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Didn't realize that was.
- Me: That's a raw data you're looking at.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, fair enough.
- Me: There's many, many customers I would not trust this with.
- Them: Good to know. Yeah.
- Me: You know, it's funny. It's like a. It's like an ongoing project because I could actually just protect those cells.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: And just so you know, you just can't touch them at all. And just. Just keep ones that you can change.
- Them: As I say, I didn't even think I'd go over that side. If I did this, I'm It'll probably have been where they're finding replacement state, but otherwise I'll just freeze up to row D so that when I scroll across, I'll know which asset groups I'M and otherwise I just change the ones that have headlines, descriptions, etc.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Good. One thing I did notice, which I've done, is that the. UK and US ones looks likely different. They got a different number of headlines and descriptions. Because, look, I've got eight long headlines on the uk, pmax, the usp, Max. When they don't, I've just deleted them now. They didn't need to be that many. So that was a Another little hiccup. And 22 headlines, which is rubbish. No, there is no longer that many.
- Them: Seems to go. This seemed to be an easier way of working than. Black Friday.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, I just. It would just be just another couple of weeks on this and it would have been nailed. It's just trying to see the fog through the fog at the moment. Because it is. It is. It is important to get it done. Because it's that this is like, your last little 1% effort. That a lot of people don't bother doing because it's a pain in the ass. And this is the one that makes the difference.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I just noticed there. There's actually headline 16. Yeah. There's only actually 15 headlines around. Okay? Right. Well, I'll get that. I'll get the rip. Just a quick summary for you. I'm going to create this for this week based upon where we are at the moment.
- Them: Yeah, perfect.
- Me: Have a think what we're going to do next week. I'll download. The assets to where the art at the moment, and I'll give you a shout when they're done. And I'm going to adjust it all. So we're using that budget of 171. Because that's going to make a big difference as well. Okay?

Me: On it. All right.
Them: Oh, yeah.
Me: I am there. You might not want to look at me, but. How's it going? Mate.
Them: I'm all right. You.
Me: Yeah, just crisp. I'm all Christmas out already. We on the eigth of December. It's just bonkers. So yesterday I decided these freaking assets. You know when you start something. And you go down a path and you get to a certain point, you go. This would have been quicker to do with a quill. And a piss parchment and send it off by carrier pigeon. But, you know, you've gone too far down the road and you're building something for the future, but you are actually getting to the point and going, is this really worth it? That was Yesterday at about 9:00. Then five hours later, I found out there was actually an error in Claude. Jesus. So that had to do a work round. I finished about 8:00 last night. I watched Norris win the Grand Prix, which is amazing. But, yeah, life and hours.
Them: Wow.
Me: And then my sis wanted to go to. Sorry, I just. I'd have a moan, just for a second, if you don't mind.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Me: This needed to go to the hospital this morning for an appointment. And that was I had to get her there for half past seven. I wasn't going to give up my daily walk, I wasn't going to give up my breakfast, I wasn't going to give up my yoga. So I had to get up at quarter to six. So I am absolutely wasted. I'm also delaying because I'm just running a quick report for you while we're up to. I'm just working on the image assets are being problematic at the moment. They're not the end of the world. That's why, you know, I'm working on them now. I'll get them in as soon as possible. But they're not the end of the world. They're just in the PMAX and the RSAs. But the actual text is in the promotion. Extension's done. The merchant center promotions are working.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So we're up. We're up and running. I'm going to give you a shout. Might not be today, might be tomorrow. Where to let you know that the spreadsheets are ready for the next stage up in the 14th, so it might just be case we just take that bit out. But I'm going to reload them. So we've got a position where.
Them: Yeah. Okay?
Me: It's clean. It reflects exactly what's in Google Ads. So one thing that's come to my attention is that once that spreadsheet's in, we can't really change anything. We can't change campaign names. We can't change asset group names or anything. We're going to leave it exactly as it is. Otherwise it won't match. But whatever. So I've just run a report. So we're sort of like P9 phase three now. So the problem last week, or the challenge last week, was to pull the budgets down without knackering it. We didn't do too bad.
Them: Yeah.
Me: We're overspending on the UK budget, which is understandable. Anyway, to go from that massive point of Black Friday down to where it is at the moment and then bring it back again for the sale.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Is a challenge, to say the least. The roas is above target. We're on 482 for P9, which is above where we wanted to be. I'm going to just get together a report for you. That just gives you a better something that you can present to the powers that be as to where we're up to. But that's basically it. We're going to be under that target, mate. There's absolutely no way, no how.
Them: No, that's fine. As I say, It's. If there are areas of the business were doing well or better, then there'd be more of a conversation around. Let's spend some more. But we could spend another 50 grand. But it's not going to change the fact that stores are down. So then ultimately the whole business is down anyway.
Me: And they're bringing the bulk of the budget, of the money.
Them: So. Big. Yeah. Yeah. So we can't over perform our target and their target.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: To get where we need to be. So it's almost like, well, let's just do what we can with what we got.
Me: Yeah. I think. I think the part of the debrief will be. Actually looking next time at doing this in August. You know, what's the budget going to be? What's the plan? Doing a marketing plan going forward. Doing it sensitively.
Them: Well, this. Yeah.
Me: I mean, even something as simple as changing these tax has just been a nightmare because it's. They're all over the place. It's. It. It wasn't necessarily in a logical place. To do them all. So that, that's something to work on for the future. But, yeah, I'm ringing it as much as I can, and I'm spending the money where they, where the, the, the roas is highest. You know, the, the Europe's done particularly well. We're on 745roas for Europe. The only one that's underperforming, really, is the UK. 3. 73. The US is on 608, rest of the world's on 501, so total is 4 82. But of course, the UK is a big percentage of that, so it does, it does drag it down. So. Yeah. So the plan is to spend some money this week. Then the week after, just. Let's just see what we've got left. I think it's been impossible to actually say, this is definitely what's going to happen there. This is definitely what's going to happen there. It's looking at how the budget ebbs and flows, gives you. If you push your budget up to five grand one day, then bring it down to one grand the next day. Then Google's saying, well, you, that's, that's five grand over 30 days. So that's six grand over 30 days. So let's, let's split that out. You know, that's, that's how much it's going to be. It doesn't just go, that's. An absolute amount of money that you can spend. So it's like, I liken it to. If you imagine you were in a balloon and you wanted to go up, you go and like that.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And then you wait 30 seconds, then it starts to go up. And it's the same when you come down. You know, you let it out and it's still. I know it's not quite like a boom, but all steering a big tanker as well. It just takes a long time for this steering to go.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I need a. I need something in between the tanker and the balloon analogy.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: But, yeah, I'll. I'll pink something over to you as soon as I can. Just you've got something to. To present. So I've not got. I haven't. I don't really have a number for you yet. As to what we're likely to hear. Oh, projected P9 revenue 8, 8, 6. So that will be 21 below the target.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. You know what? As I say, it is what it is.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I don't think. The amount of money that we'd have to spend in order to. Come in on target. The rice for that?
Me: 50 grand.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And I don't. I don't know whether it's too late anyway.
Them: Yeah. Well, this is it. And the other thing that, because it gets absorbed into one view now is we've actually got. We've got an additional 39 that we're using this month anyway. So.
Me: Right. Right. I mean, I've got. I've got one eight. Three. 1-833-929 I'm working on.
Them: Yeah. So we had to reduce it last week to one certain 1-963 because of our 12 overspend from last. So I've got zero spending bing for this month.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: So of the 12. Overspend. Three of it's going to be covered by Bing because everything's paused.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And then 9 of it needs to be covered by Google.
Me: So I've got to come down to 174.
Them: 11172.
Me: Okay?
Them: Yeah. Because if I take, if I ignore that 9. Yeah.
Me: You're right, mate. No, you're right.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You're right. I. I literally did this five minutes before we came on, right? Are you right?
Them: No, it's fine. I mean, this is why these meetings are good, because.
Me: Y. Eah. So the new. The new p9. Budget is 17 2.
Them: Yeah, I'm just going to ping in our chat. Just the view that I've got. So we've got the same.
Me: 1-7-1963. Okay.
Them: Yeah. So 117 2. That takes into account nine of the 12 overspend. And then, as I say, the remaining three, I've just put Bing to zero.
Me: Yeah. Okay? Yeah, no problem.
Them: Cool, so. Okay. Yeah, I mean, text ads and stuff. Front ended, looking good. And actually, I don't know if it's just a bit of luck. In terms of what I'm served. But it works quite nicely the text ads that I'm seeing, because we haven't.
Me: A skill adjustment, mate. It's not. Look.
Them: Spaffed. 20 everywhere.
Me: Good.
Them: It reads quite nicely. Listen to ones I've seen.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Well, I've got smice and a Bond street headline one. Enjoy. 20 off. And Sunday.
Me: Yeah. Cool.
Them: Just nice and easy, that's all. I.
Me: Yeah, yeah. And it. And it will. The thing is, Google likes shiny new things, as we all do. And if it sees a new headline, especially if it's in off there and it. And if you, if you, if you couple that up with the promotion extension as well, which says it's a Christmas offer. 2020 off selected. Gifts. A 20 off selected. There's no. There wasn't enough room to put it all in there. The. The merchant center ad will do the same thing. It'll say that there's a, There's a promotion on. So we've, we've, I think we've got it covered. I say it's just a bit frustrating not getting the images on, but they'll, they'll back it up today. But they're just tiny. The. Images. You know, all those search. Those searches you've done have got very few images actually next to them and they're 20 off. You probably can't read anyway. But, yeah, I think. I'm just pleased with it. Up and running by the time the powers that be start to. Search on the Internet at 8:00 in the morning when they're having the breakfast, so.
Them: Know. I mean, Sep. I saw your message as I was looking for the gym this morning. And then I saw seb. About 8:00. I just got back and the code wasn't working. So someone had caught that up on. The e. Commerce team.
Me: The code.
Them: Yeah. So someone had not set it up properly. On the website side.
Me: It wasn't a code.
Them: Yeah.gif20.
Me: Like you said, that I've not set these up as a code. Right. These aren't. These aren't set up as a go. It's going to make absolutely difference because.
Them: Well, they're going to see the offer.
Me: You see it on the site?
Them: Yeah. So as long as the skus match, that doesn't really matter.
Me: Yeah. But. But you have to put the code in to get the 20% off.
Them: Because. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that'll be on every product. It will say.
Me: I don't know how, but I've missed that completely. I. I didn't realize that was a code.
Them: Yeah. So on the site. Let me just show you quick. So say they come through an RSA or whatever.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Or for a sponsored product. Oh, no, that's no good for you, is it? On bloody screen. That one is what you want. So they come from. They come for an ad anyway.
Me: All right. Okay. Can you click on one of those products?
Them: They'll see this.
Me: Then.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Right.
Them: Ignore the 40. That's because I've got staff discount. So that's what they'll see.
Me: Isn't that funny? So Google. Google. Look at that and go, that's fine. You don't need a code for that because it's seen a strike through on the price.
Them: Yeah. Hang on, let me show you.
Me: But if you add that to your bag now.
Them: Let me do it this way because it's. That. Okay, so what you saw with the strike first, because my staff discount overrides it.
Me: I. See?
Them: So. That's what this. See there? So it almost doesn't really matter whether the ad says. With code. Like my RSA text doesn't say with code. It just says there's 20% off.
Me: Yeah. Okay?
Them: End of Sunday. And then when they come, all the messaging on the site is 20% off. GIF 20. So that's everywhere. So they can.
Me: I think we've. We've conned. With Con Google here, which is quite good. So I wonder what the ad looks like then. See the the 20% off selected GIFs is working. Wow. And the uk is a 921 roas today.
Them: Yeah, so, like, there. That's. To me, that is the ideal, and that's probably what I pin.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Because as soon as they click through, it's going to say, use code. So that's fine. And all of these sponsored products.
Me: I mean, it's true, isn't it? Oh, there we go. Look at that.
Them: So.
Me: And look at that. It's got the. It's got the. The strike through on. There.
Them: Yeah, so that's fine. Because as soon as they go through to that product, It will be full price, but. But it's odd because. If Google was to scrape our site, they'll see that at full price.
Me: Yes, they were. But I'm pushing through in the merchant center. What the. No, I'm not. I'm. I'm not pushing through the merchant center. The sale price.
Them: Yes.
Me: You don't have a show handy, do you? Or just a name of that. What's that? Block backpack.
Them: So that's the equivalent. Yeah, Tiger Norton or something similar.
Me: So title? Norton. Sorry. Yeah. There's now a sale price. Wow. All right, I'll keep an eye on it, mate. And if if needs be, I can just whack it in there. That's actually worked out really well, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. Yeah, so that's fine. So they click through that sponsored product and then obviously they won't see the discount of one that they saw. On the shopping ad.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But they'll see 20% off a GIF code gift. 20.
Me: You've been upfront about it. I mean, it's they. They proposition is on the page, isn't it? But you could buy that for 1,150, couldn't you?
Them: Yeah. Yeah, you could. Yeah. Yeah, if you were. If you ignored. All of the. See, look at that. Even that. That.
Me: Yeah.
Them: 's just what's nice. Is all of this stuff as well, which is more brand, brand, brand, brand, and then brand with the offer.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: Rather than, I mean. I think internally. We cocked up a bit on the text on Black Friday. On my side. I don't think it should have been.
Me: Fall in your face.
Them: No, but it should have been in there. But. Saying up to 30% off in four headlines.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Fell into a pier. One after the other, they just look. Oh, they're still.
Me: Well.
Them: There.
Me: That's not a sponsored ad. Oh, yes, it is.
Them: Yeah. They haven't gone away.
Me: Well, that's a bit naughty. They've not that. 's from Google's perspective, they're not actually making a big deal of a sponsor results there, are they? It used to be by the side of the actual wording, it would say it was a sponsored result.
Them: Yeah.
Me: They're pissing money away, though, mate. That's a good thing. And you look at. See, the thing is, you look at the real estate you've got there. You've got that big wedge at the top. With all the site lengths, you've got all the products on the side until about number six. If someone's looking for the brand, they're gonna. They're gonna find it. You know, they're not. They're hardly going to be direct.
Them: Well, I mentioned this. I mentioned this to. Set again, and he was just like, no, keep it on.
Me: He might be getting pressure from above, though. It's. Sometimes we've got to spend this money to keep the, to keep the, the, the, the people in power happy, don't we? And if it's 50 pound a month,
Them: Well. I think it is the case because. They're kind of saying, well, what's happening to the additional budget? And he's saying, well, it's been, you know, a lot of it goes into brand because, yeah, the brand CPCs are up, the brand costs are up because we're doing, you know, because Aspanol have decided that they've got nothing else better to do than just. Been on smice and terms.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's a nice non brand. Search terms coming through for last week. Though.
Me: Good.
Them: Some more. You know, like luxury Christmas cards. 2026 diary.
Me: Nice.
Them: Jewelry box.
Me: That's the thing now, isn't it? Is whether the diaries are going to start to. To really kick in.
Them: Yeah, well, I think that's what Seb said, actually. I mean, Just fine. The last from him. So, yes, today. We were up 25% on forecast, up 35 on last year, and it was mostly diaries. Which is good because the offer this week doesn't have any diaries in. No. It's not like we're sold to a load of people for price stuff, but now it's in the offer.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And apparently the US Was pretty good on Saturday and Sunday as well.
Me: Well, from my perspective, the pmax Diaries is shit. It's awful. 2:37. So whether it's too soon. Don't know. The us. Brandon+diaries565 that's very good. Pmax diaries 9:46. But we're only spending 29 quid on it. Just if only. You hate leaving stuff on the table, don't you?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Just going to do. It's just doing a little bit of rejiggling.
Them: Just notice. And we're picking up papier the the stationery brand through. Looks like heroes and psychics shopping is picking up. That at a term we can probably.
Me: I can't really do much about it, to be honest. The negs on on pmax. I think if you did an analysis.
Them: Well, that's Paul was anywhere.
Me: Is what, three?
Them: Oh, sorry. I just realized that's paused.
Me: You. You'll be getting the odd thing like that. It's. It's 10% spend on PMAX is on research.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Apparently.
Them: I just saw Smy UK shop in here as a psychics.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Then I went to go and have a look at that campaign, but it looks like it's paused anyway. So that must be a recent.
Me: Uk pmax, h&s.
Them: No uk shop in h and s. So if you look in the UK for last week, it was the second highest spending campaign.
Me: Let me just have a look. Some of these. It's been. The spend won't come down quick enough, so I've actually paused some. Yeah. Shopping. I've literally just done that. So that's 305.
Them: Yeah.
Me: 305 roas the last seven days. So what I've done is I've. I've moved the spend from there. 282 to the PMAX campaign.
Them: How does interest. So. How does shopping determine what terms it can trigger for like, if you just had a standalone shopping campaign on its own.
Me: Well, if you think even with pmax, pmax is shopping and search. So you mentioned the two separate parts. There are other bits and pieces in it, but the shopping part of it and the shopping part of the shopping campaign looks at your merchant center. So it looks at the headlines and they're titled in the description from. From Merchant center, and it determines what keywords it thinks should actually fire off for that product. So there are processes you can go through and optimize your titles and descriptions. So that they're better for shopping.
Them: Right, so less control than search, for example, you can say, I just want to pay for exactly this, and then I'll shop ins. More akin to pmax then, in the sense that there's less control over exactly what it fires for.
Me: Correct. Yeah. And again, as I say, pmax Shopping is part of pmax as well, so it's the same for that. But pmax also doesn't have keywords for search.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: So that uses your pages. So it'll look at your pages and say, I think the keyword for that one should be that. And it's like the old style DSA campaigns, dynamic search ad campaigns. So it will look at the page and go, I think. I think you should be firing for this. And over time, it'll optimize when things don't work. But you can for both of them. What you can do is you can make sure that your page itself. Looks good. It's got the right. They've got the right keywords on. It's got big descriptions. But then you can also do the same on Merchant center. And I've done it. Product Hero has a facility where you can actually pass it through headlines and titles and descriptions that it's optimized.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So it's not like it's not quite keyword stuffing. It's still got to look right, but you can actually optimize them. And that only affects the ads. It doesn't affect anything on the site at all. You can still keep the look and feel of the website, but you can change those titles and descriptions going through to the shopping ad. So if you click a shopping ad, it does expand out a little bit, doesn't it? You know, you can actually put some pieces on it. And it's all down to how near the front of the title are the words. How near to the front of the description, the words. Because as a human being, that's the thing that absolutely describes it. So if you were to do smice and luxury leather, diary.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: I would put diary luxury leather smisen.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: Because it puts more emphasis on the emphasis on the. On the physical product in the fact that it is actually a diary.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And if someone's looking for diary, that's where they're going to go. So it's just about optimization. But it's not something I would want to rush. I have done it. Some of the products, but not all of them.
Them: No, that makes sense. So I guess that's. Yeah. So that. That explains, kind of why shopping last week picked up papier.
Me: Yes.
Them: Because obviously,
Me: You could look at those spelling.
Them: Yeah. No, it's interesting. What, it. What it pulls up. I mean, we're still getting, I think Aspen or London. Where it was. One, two, three. Fifth. Non brand search term.
Me: Right. Really? And is it converting?
Them: For clicks. No, I tell you. The ones with the highest conversion, most amount of conversions. It's not a huge amount of data in this, but. It's quite long. Search terms, note cards with envelopes, leather emboss, notebooks. Diary. Luxury bookmarks, I think Christmas cards.
Me: Well, we've got.
Them: Those are ones in super conversions on Aspinall as a search term.
Me: Yeah. Well, in the. In the pmax campaign. Last seven days for aspen. All we've got. It's a four. It's a 400 roas. So, you know, I was lucky that they were spending on average. I can't see what they were. So cost per conversion 57.45. So they're spending money when they're coming through. But it's only 13 clicks and 1,500 impressions and you're paying 8 pound 84 average CPC. The actual. The actual. That's ridiculous. You've got two clicks on the word aspinal from one of the asset groups and it's 34 pound 50 average CPC. And it converted. So that's the power of Google. So those would you ever pay 34 pound 50 for a click? The answer is yes, because it brought you in a ROAS of 662%. Because its audience driven.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It knew that those people were going were likely to convert, so it was willing to pay more for them. That's an incredible stat. That is absolutely incredible.
Them: It's a proper engine, isn't it? All of that.
Me: Yeah, yeah. Quite scary, really.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That's two clicks and two conversions.
Them: So it's. Yeah. So some good stuff. So I'll probably pick up the stuff that's got the clicks this week. Really? Because it's more relevant, I think, like jewelry, box diaries, fashion, Christmas cards. That's the sort of stuff they want to hear. So that's all kind of working nicely.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I've done a.
Them: And then it's just a rush to the delivery dates now.
Me: Yeah.
Them: The last delivery list.
Me: I did a quick Brown versus Non brand for another client the other day, which is quite interesting, so that's another analysis to do. Where I can just. I'll pull the search term report. For the whole site for a whole period, and then I can do a brand versus non brand on it. And you can see then what the ROAS is, what the CPCs are and so on. That should be quite an interesting project.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. What else have we got? Yes, obviously. Run this for each so tomorrow. Or Wednesday. I'll go through. Do you know you made a copy of that text assets sheet? I don't think we need that. Because sometimes in my mind, because I go through all of those tabs. And I change anything that's out of date or wrong, and I swear I go through again. Only a few hours later, and I'm like, how did I not see that? But it was wrong. That bit was wrong. So I think now the current live document. That's got the promo stuff in as well. That is the most up to date.
Me: I'm going to change the name of it. I'm going to put the word live at the end of it. There you go.
Them: Version. Yeah, I nearly did.
Me: There we go. It's in.
Them: That's the most. Valid version. What I'd love to do, just for my sort of OCD brain, is have Joan. You've got repeating headlines.
Me: Yep.
Them: Is to have all of them, all of the ones that repeat in a nice little order so over 135 years is always in this column.
Me: Big.
Them: And then any of your, like, more individual ones are at the end.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: That's where I want to try and just get the house in order a little bit.
Me: Be dead easy. Yeah, it would be Denny doing that. I can't. I don't. I after yesterday. Let's leave that till after Christmas.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ox, We've got loads. Yeah. So I think we'll probably. Wednesday, I'll go back to, like, the full price Christmas thing. So I'll go through all of those, update all the images, texts across all markets.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So that from Monday morning next week, we are. Fully back Christmas, full price.
Me: Okay?
Them: I will probably chuck in. Process wise. I'm just thinking. Site link. Or a headline. For last delivery dates.
Me: Yes. Site link.
Them: Yeah, but for a site link for lasted every dates. And I just chucked them in the accounts. And then they'll get delayed. They'll just take them out next week or take them out once the date's gone past.
Me: So for the site links for last order date. Great one. Because it's a time limitation, so it's going to, it's going to force people to, to, to order a bit sooner if you add them as a site link.
Them: Yeah.
Me: At account level. Then we can put an expiry date on it and it'll come off anyway.
Them: Okay?
Me: So there's this. You can put a start date on and an end date for it.
Them: That's good.
Me: And if you want to. I mean, I don't mind doing it if you want to do it. And just tell me when you've done it and I'll go and have a look at it.
Them: So I do account level. Fine. Yeah, I'll give you a shout. It probably. It'd probably be the same and I'll get round to it, I think, but. I'll count level. And we just stick all the stick order dates in an expiry date, and then we're good. Okay, that's fine, because they're not far off anyway. I mean, it's only. Last chance. Us is next week.
Me: Okay?
Them: Last chance to use next week. And then Last Chance UK is at the end of next week.
Me: Right.
Them: Okay, fine. That's. That's good. We'll get those in as well. And then it's a case of. Redoing those sheets for phase one of sale.
Me: Yep.
Them: So again, I'll have. If I just take care of all the assets and images and stuff across all the markets, and I'll let you know when it's all good.
Me: I really appreciate that. Thank you. I feel like I'm. I feel like I'm a puppeteer at the moment, doing the budgets, you know, because things are changing so quickly.
Them: Yeah. Well, the way I see it is I'd rather. Pay you for your time. For doing stuff that's worthy of your level. Do you know what I mean? Rather than you having to go in.
Me: I. Don't know.
Them: And cop it.
Me: What? You want a cup of tea? Then? Okay.
Them: You know, to have you on board. I don't want to waste your time.
Me: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Them: Copying and pasting text. It's. That's not.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I mean. Respectfully, anyone can, you know. So if it's just a case of four hours of doing that, it's better off me doing that and letting you focus on optimizing the accounts.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. You were also putting the business spin on it. That, to me, is the most important thing is it's. It's business knowledge you're putting into it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, you. You know what's going on there. What's important, so.
Them: Well, it's all the isms, isn't it? And the last little minute changes over the desk. And I can just go in and just sheet rather than meet. They tell me. Me tell you. You do it. You send it back to me. Yeah, so.
Me: Cool. Yeah.
Them: I'll handle that stuff. And then I think we'll. If you're happy, we'll use the same approach as we are for this, for the sale. I'm not going to obliterate it.
Me: Good.
Them: And obviously you have to take out all of the. Kind of gifting stuff, so it'll be kind of sales. You know, luxury goods and take all the Christmas gifting, messaging out, but it's, it's going to be a similar level of text. Either. Yeah. There's no point. Kind of.
Me: What do they what are the hidden downsides to blasting it all with the text? Like the, like the Black Friday one is the fact that you're actually taking out keywords that are relevant to the search terms that people are putting in. So that that's twofold. One is that it it messes up with click through rate.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because people aren't seeing irrelevance in, in what they're seeing. And the other thing it messes about with your, your quality score for the ad, which is the thing really, if your quality is still suddenly comes down from high to, to average, you suddenly pay more for you for your clicks because Google going, that's not relevant to, to what people are searching for. So it increases the CPCs. So, but when you first look at it, you can't, you can't go, oh, you categorically, it's gone down from that to that because you changed that. We are getting to that stage now where I will be able to provide that source of information as to is is giving a root cause analysis which includes where the, where the quality score is of the, of the keyword. So we have to keep those in. You know, we can't. We can't just. That's why we don't have just a template of just, like, all the same ones. They have to be specific towards that product. But the more PMAX campaigns you have, the more asset groups there are, the more RSAs you have, people are less likely. To do it because it's a bol like to actually change them. And that's where I think we're going to get a real big win. Coming up where there can be nuanced add text for everything. You know, the whole purpose of creating loads of asset groups is, is your. One thing is you're creating relevant assets towards that product, and secondly, relevant audiences who want to find that product.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, people. We can't put the same audience group in all the time because it's not smise and stationary. Well, what happens if you want to buy a bag? I'm looking for a bag. Oh, you only do stationery. So Google won't actually point people at the ads, so we have. To get more granular, but to do that, you have to have the. The stuff in the background to be able to manage it.
Them: Yeah. No, it makes sense. And I think, like you say, You know, appearing for, you know. Luxury leather bounds or whatever. And then people seeing the. Oh, there's a sale on.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Cool.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah. So we'll go down a similar route and just kind of.
Me: Cool.
Them: It'll be in there, across all of them. And then my assumption. I mean, the obvious assumption would be that the ones that appear, the headlines that appear with the sale messaging in, will have a higher click through. Therefore they'll show more often.
Me: For it? Yes. Yeah, if they, if it floats their boat, if they're of the demographic that's gonna. That's going to be more likely to click through, which is most people. I get it. But if it said, you know, luxury leather bags save 20%, yeah, that's. That's the message, isn't it? But we don't have to Suddenly go otherwise. 50% luxury leather bags and 50 off. There's all the rest of it as well.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: You know that that adds value to it all.
Them: No cool. Fine. So I think.
Me: This sale is that boxing day?
Them: What? In terms of start date.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Christmas Eve, and it's normally between four and six. Yeah, somewhere between four and six.
Me: Okay?
Them: So obviously I'll have all the. All the assets and bits updated way before then.
Me: Great.
Them: It doesn't take you long to dip to upload them into.
Me: It's the same as this.
Them: The okay.
Me: Is it. This is why I've got it. I've got to really, today, absolutely focus on getting those image assets. Updated. It's incredibly complicated. To say the least, because you got 15 images in there. So. So you say, or what you do? Do you take them all out first and then put the 15 in? Well, you can't do that because Google said there's not enough images and it'll blow up. You can't add them in because you're only allowed 50. Sorry, it's 20. You can't add them in because you go over the 20. So it's actually taking one out. Put one in, take your one out. Put money. If you do that manually, you know, you or I would put them. In. In a little slot, they'd be easy, but Google's not finding it particularly easy.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. It'd be nice if it was kind of like. Update and replace, wouldn't there? So if every. If. If it matches an asset ID that already exists in there, ignore if it's a new one.
Me: Yeah. Replace it.
Them: Replies.
Me: Yeah, and that's what's missing. There's no replace. You got to remove and add.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So, yeah, it's. In fact, it's been running while we've been talking and it's said again, it's going to be tricky. I don't care. The language was ripe yesterday. He was. I actually said to you, really up there, didn't you? And it just went, yes, you're correct. I fucked up, which is.
Them: Well, worst case. Comes to shove, I'll just chuck them in. Bob's r weight. For your update.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. As you say. Give me till Wednesday, probably Wednesday afternoon. To make sure I've got it all boxed off. I'll reload the that sheet. I might, I think. I'm going to put in that sheet, it's called Smite and Add Text Assets Live. I'm going to put updated on such and such a date and the time so that you know. You know absolutely that it's the right one and then you can just go nuts with it then.
Them: Okay, perfect. Yeah.
Me: Big validation process that takes place when it's once you've put your stuff in to make sure there's enough images. Make sure the text to the right length and all that kind of stuff as well.
Them: Cool. And I've also got some, like, full price. Stuff for Europe. When this comes back off a promo.
Me: Okay?
Them: So that should be good. Wondering if I might have to go through and do all the images. Just thinking when I update to take the promo stuff off, I've got no way of knowing which ones were the promo image assets.
Me: You can search on image ID within Google.
Them: Have I?
Me: If you go to tools, asset studio and asset library, I think.
Them: Just do a control f, take the asset. The landscape ones dirt control F on the sheet.
Me: Yeah. It says asset id. Whether that.
Them: Yeah, so actually correspond to the sheet and then I could just do a find and remove.
Me: I'm sorry it's such a pain. I. I was trying to make it simple. I actually did a. A search facility, but it'll only work locally. I can't put it onto an external server to run it.
Them: No, that's fine. I like to take a couple of hours to do. Probably. Yeah. Cut that as half a day to do most of those, so that's cool. And then the primary text are easy because I'll just do a control F for anything with 20% in.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Bin those off. I've saved the load of the stuff that I took out. So I'll put that back in.
Me: Cool.
Them: And I have. I did do quite a bit of UNC capitalizing. That's the right way to say it. Uncapitalized and stuff.
Me: So just a word of warning I said before about the asset groups. There was a couple of asset groups where the word diaries had been changed to an uppercase from a lowercase. I don't know whether it's me, but it just put the ads into a weird place where they shouldn't have been.
Them: From upper too lower or lower to upper?
Me: It was from lower to up. It didn't matter either way. It just sees it as a different asset group name.
Them: Oh, Asset group names.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's probably melting you. I don't think you'd add any reason to change it, but.
Them: All right. Oh, no. Yeah, no, I misheard you. I don't. Yeah, no, I just tend to play with the headliner subscriptions. But. Okay, that's good to know that. I didn't actually realize they were. Okay. Well, that's a. That's a good one for me to, anyway.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So if you put, for example, stationary, if I was to change that to a lowercase stationary, that that becomes a new asset group with a new asset group id. Ask you now.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Didn't realize that was.
Me: That's a raw data you're looking at.
Them: Yeah. Okay, fair enough.
Me: There's many, many customers I would not trust this with.
Them: Good to know. Yeah.
Me: You know, it's funny. It's like a. It's like an ongoing project because I could actually just protect those cells.
Them: Okay?
Me: And just so you know, you just can't touch them at all. And just. Just keep ones that you can change.
Them: As I say, I didn't even think I'd go over that side. If I did this, I'm It'll probably have been where they're finding replacement state, but otherwise I'll just freeze up to row D so that when I scroll across, I'll know which asset groups I'M and otherwise I just change the ones that have headlines, descriptions, etc.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Good. One thing I did notice, which I've done, is that the. UK and US ones looks likely different. They got a different number of headlines and descriptions. Because, look, I've got eight long headlines on the uk, pmax, the usp, Max. When they don't, I've just deleted them now. They didn't need to be that many. So that was a Another little hiccup. And 22 headlines, which is rubbish. No, there is no longer that many.
Them: Seems to go. This seemed to be an easier way of working than. Black Friday.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, I just. It would just be just another couple of weeks on this and it would have been nailed. It's just trying to see the fog through the fog at the moment. Because it is. It is. It is important to get it done. Because it's that this is like, your last little 1% effort. That a lot of people don't bother doing because it's a pain in the ass. And this is the one that makes the difference.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I just noticed there. There's actually headline 16. Yeah. There's only actually 15 headlines around. Okay? Right. Well, I'll get that. I'll get the rip. Just a quick summary for you. I'm going to create this for this week based upon where we are at the moment.
Them: Yeah, perfect.
Me: Have a think what we're going to do next week. I'll download. The assets to where the art at the moment, and I'll give you a shout when they're done. And I'm going to adjust it all. So we're using that budget of 171. Because that's going to make a big difference as well. Okay?
