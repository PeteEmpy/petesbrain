# Paid Search catch up


### Dashboard & Strategy Updates

- Smythson dashboard G sheet needs updating with actual ROAS and revenue vs strategy targets
- Will pull in actual ROAS by time, revenue and spend data
- Need current daily budget visibility each morning for all markets
- Budget increases being handled cautiously - testing 10% increases on UK brand campaigns first
- Googleâs âlimited by budgetâ signals indicate potential for conversions at target ROAS, not unlimited spend opportunity


### Budget Strategy & Timing

- Conversion rates expected to be lower early November, improving significantly around Nov 15th
- Current approach: monitor 7-day performance vs last year and strategy targets
- Need automated system to recommend daily budget adjustments based on:
  - Last 7 days performance
  - Previous year data
  - Conversion rate changes
- Revenue targets based on purchase conversion action data (duplicate actions removed)

- Last 7 days performance
- Previous year data
- Conversion rate changes


### Competitor Targeting Strategy

- Alex added Aspinal keywords to UK campaign with max CPC limits
- Peter recommends PMAX competitor asset groups over search campaigns
  - More efficient than targeting competitor keywords directly
  - Lower risk of expensive CPCs
  - Better audience expansion through search themes
- Current âCompetitors Heroes & Sidekicksâ asset group targets: Selfridges, Aspinalls, Cambridge Satchel, Serapian, Mulberry, Moleskin, Liberty London
- Plan: Test both search campaign and PMAX asset group, compare performance

- More efficient than targeting competitor keywords directly
- Lower risk of expensive CPCs
- Better audience expansion through search themes


### Christmas Campaign Structure

- Create separate Christmas PMAX campaign with 4 asset groups:
  - Christmas gifts (general)
  - Christmas gifts for him
  - Christmas gifts for her
  - HNS gifting (copied from existing)
- Keep year-round gifting asset groups in main PMAX campaign
- Preserve existing HNS asset group history - restore original text, donât replace with Christmas messaging
- Christmas campaigns allow budget flexibility and separate performance tracking

- Christmas gifts (general)
- Christmas gifts for him
- Christmas gifts for her
- HNS gifting (copied from existing)


### Product Categorization & Custom Labels

- Created supplemental feed in Merchant Center for better product grouping
- Custom Label 0 Q4 2025 includes: travel bags, jewelry boxes, cardholders
- Using G sheet supplemental feed for product ID categorization
- Can nest listing groups: Custom Label â Heroes/Sidekicks hierarchy
- Will create âfor him/for herâ labels using Custom Label 4
- Quick solution for current needs - proper categorization needed post-Christmas


### European Market Budget Allocation

- Focus on scaling existing high-performing campaigns vs creating new ones
- Several European campaigns limited by budget with strong ROAS (7+ average)
- Rest of World Brand AI: 1000% ROAS on Â£60/day (can increase to Â£97)
- Canada showing poor performance (1.06 ROAS) - investigate barriers
- Australia brand campaigns strong, product campaigns weak
- Recommendation: Triple spend on Rest of World campaign (currently 4.21 ROAS)


### Next Steps

- Peter: Convert supplemental feed to G sheet for easier sharing
- Peter: Create âfor him/for herâ custom labels using website scraping
- Alex: Restore original HNS asset group text from paused campaigns
- Alex: Create Christmas campaign structure with 4 asset groups
- Alex: Focus European budget increases on existing high-performing campaigns
- Alex: Consider separate Australia campaign due to strong conversion volume

Meeting Title: Paid Search catch up
Date: Nov 4
Meeting participants: Alex Clarke, Peter Empson

Transcript:
 
Me: The smyson. Dashboard G sheet isn't being updated with. What the actual roas and revenue are at the moment compared with what the strategy is. I know all the spreadsheets, all updated. Hi, lauren.  
Them: Peter, how are you?  
Me: I'm okay, thank you.  
Them: Good.  
Me: Bear me one second.  
Them: All right. I'm just going to get my notebook as well.  
Me: Oh. It's only Tuesday.  
Them: Phuke. T.  
Me: Is it only Tuesday?  
Them: Yes. I had already.  
Me: It's mental. I'm just looking at the strategy dashboard. It's going to be an evolving thing, this. It doesn't have the actual roas on, and it'd be good to know what the current daily budget is every morning.  
Them: Yeah, that's fine. You want to know the daily budget for each market.  
Me: Yes, that's why I'll update it with that. Because.  
Them: Okay, that's fine.  
Me: You've got in column D, it's got actual roas, so I'll pull in the actual roas by time. I'll pull in the revenue and spend as well.  
Them: Yeah, that's fine.  
Me: There not being shown.  
Them: Are you pulling in the revenue by Time as well?  
Me: I will be doing. Yeah.  
Them: Okay, lovely. That's fine. I haven't increased the budget dramatically yet just because I'm what currently just continuing to work on the health of the accounts of an incomers etc, but also I'm just being very wary of like Google saying oh, limited by budget and just throwing money into there because it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to give us that additional. Yeah, exactly. So. So I'm just looking at conversion rates and, you know, where our volume is highest. So just trying to, for example, on the UK brand Accept campaign, I've only increased it the budget by 10% just to see how.  
Me: Yeah. It won't do that. Yeah, it won't be.  
Them: It does.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And then if I can see it's, you know, giving us quite a bit more, then I'll push it further. But I. I do know, like, with us increasing our budgets, it's not going to give us proportionately the same amount of revenue. But yeah.  
Me: Yep. Okay. It will never keep coming back with limited by budget.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because what it's saying is. What it's saying is that's the budget it would spend given the targets that you're giving it. That's the way it works. It doesn't just say, I can go and I've got £5,000 worth of extra impressions to give you. It's saying I can give you conversions at your conversion value at your target roas if you. If you increase the budget. So it doesn't. It's it's not like a money generating machine. It has to try and return those roas. So I wouldn't be too concerned that it's just going to keep asking for more and more because it won't do.  
Them: I think my concern is mostly like we've lost month or last period, even though we did increase our budgets. I know that like conversion rates aren't what. Like I guess the business wanted them to be. But with increasing the budget, it didn't return us like incremental revenue because of conversion rates were down mostly, and that won't be the case for this month because things will naturally go up.  
Me: Much.  
Them: But, yeah, I'm just quite cautious of that.  
Me: Yeah, ok. But don't be over cautious.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I mean, a lot of some of this stuff is actually browsing now for Christmas, so we'll be building audiences, but I know. I get it. You know, we've already said that the conversion rate is not going to be as high at the beginning of the month.  
Them: Cool.  
Me: So it's, you know, the, the, the, the roas reduction is November, the 15th. That's when it really kicks in.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So if we have more budget, round about that time. Then great. You know, if we get more to play around with, I'm. I'm hoping to. It's just getting time to do it now. It's like the dashboards just taking inordinat time to do, But I think we need it. But it would be good to have something that says,  
Them: Okay, cool. Yeah. So.  
Me: Based upon the performance from the last seven days. And the performance from last year and the, the, the strategy that we've set, increase the budget on this campaign by this much on this particular date. But it's going to have to be done on a regular, on a daily basis, because the conversion rates are going to be changing on a daily basis.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, so you're gonna have to, like, refresh the dashboard.  
Me: Well, yes. Yeah, but I mean, I'm not I don't necessarily mean on the dashboard, but it's just something that could possibly be developed to keep tracking the the, the budget to say, well, this is this is possibly now the time to increase the budget on such and such a campaign. But, yeah, I'VE got to get the dashboard sorted out first.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? And just to confirm the revenue targets that you've, like, placed there from, like, last year's performance as well. So, like, the 780K. Because I know, like, we had to, like, update. That. Based on the fact that, you know, we had duplicate actions.  
Me: It was. It was based upon the. The purchase conversion action. That was. That was what it calculated. So. So I've only. I've only tracked. Yeah, I've only tracked those particular conversion actions and then. And then. Because it was a load of rubbish.  
Them: Okay? Yeah, that's fine. I'll just. Yeah. Which is? What was in the account? Yeah.  
Me: Scary still.  
Them: I will just, like, reiterate that to Alex again. Hello. Catch up with him. That's what we need to focus on. Cool. I put together, like, the task list, just, like a load of things that needed, need to get done this week. Seb wanted to put in some competitor keywords like Roster B, Aspinals, etc. So so far, I've only put in a campaign for the uk. With a couple of Aspinal keywords. Some of them. Are like search terms that have converted and then I'll switch for 30 days or last period. And there's a keyword that, like a brand that sells briefcases that I've seen in our PMAX search terms quite a few times, so I've added that in. I'm gonna replicate that for the other markets, but I'll do it based on, like, what we're seeing in our search terms. Report.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So what people are actually searching for. So yeah. And then did you have any other questions around, like, what's on the list?  
Me: I mean, as far as the competitors are concerned, I wouldn't necessarily focus on a search campaign that's actually targeting those keywords. I'll be more inclined to. Use pmax to do it. Because it's going to be a little bit more. You can just get some very high Albi CPCs when you're targeting. You know, if you shamelessly targeting a competitor's brand, I would be.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I would be more inclined to go to the competitors asset group.  
Them: Go on to.  
Me: And play around with that. To give us what we want. Because then you can target all of those competitors.  
Them: Search themes.  
Me: Using search themes, using the audience signals. There's an asset group called Competitors, Heroes and sidekicks. We've started to do that. It's not necessarily using search themes yet, but it does use an audience signal. Which. Looks at your competitors.  
Them: Does it have? Does it have the competitors? Do you know how you can target keywords in the audience signal?  
Me: Well, you use search themes. Not necessarily. You wouldn't necessarily use keywords in the same way as, you know, we expand our R brand, not just using the actual, the actual name of it. If you if you use search themes, you could also, within the audience, signal. Do I think you can actually do keywords? Let me just see.  
Them: Yeah, that's what I'm referring to. Like the keywords that you can add in the audience. You can.  
Me: New segments. You can't anymore.  
Them: Be able to. That's fine. We can edit a search tree and then yes, when I created the competitor search campaign I added in bid max CPC limit because I did say to 7 Nicole yesterday if we do this I received PCBCs are actually going to be quite high. So I'll kind of caveat that with putting in a portfolio bid strategy on that campaign, but we could, we could also try out the competitor, PMAX Asset Group and see what performs better.  
Me: I know. Okay. I say I'd be more inclined to do that than use. Than use a search campaign. We might just find it eats the budget. And we're making sure that we're actually, you know, we're in a bit more controlling. We don't need to think about specific keywords for competitors. We can put the right sort of search themes in for those competitors, but we don't need to necessarily expand it out because the asset group will do that anyway. So if we do a double approach to search themes in which are related to those competitors and then put expand out the audience signal is called competitors. If you expand that out at the moment, it looks at. Selfridges, Aspinalls, Cambridge Satchel. Serapian wykoms. Moleskin. Leather talks. Liberty london. So, you know, if you want to add to that, you could expand that out. You could potentially also do a competitors, which is bags, and the competitors, which is stationary.  
Them: Briefcases and, yeah.  
Me: Yeah. So we're actually showing them the right sort of assets when they land. So that might be a better idea, in which case breakout that competitors audience into those two separate things. So if that leather one, that will just be bags, whereas Aspinals, it could be. It could be the stationary one, it would be more suited. To AT Liberties as well.  
Them: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. In the search campaign I created, there's, like, a briefcases ad group just to target those. The brands that are, like, our briefcase competitors, but, yeah, I get what you mean. So with the penis, basically, in terms of, like, it being able to capture loads of different brands, could you just explain why you think it would be more efficient than the search, than doing a search campaign, apart from, like, the Max CPC bag? Completely get that. But in terms of, like, capturing the traffic that we're looking for.  
Me: It's going to be more efficient. You know, it's all well and good showing Seb, that we've actually got those targeted as keywords. But are they converting or not?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So the pmax is more likely to expand itself out into areas we wouldn't think about than the search campaign we'll do. Unless you're going to start using broad and broad on a search campaign of that type could get very, very expensive. I think the best bet to do is to. Is to monitor both that campaign and that asset group.  
Them: I agree.  
Me: And see which one performs the best, you know, and look at the search teams, look at the search terms in the PMAX campaign and make sure we are getting those competitor terms coming up.  
Them: Yeah, I agree.  
Me: And what sort of CPCs they are. And if we're finding out the CPCs allowing the PMAX, then I would question whether to keep the search one going. I'm just not. I'm not a fan of search campaigns targeting competitors keywords. I think it would just crash it burn that's my opinion.  
Them: Just continue. Yeah. It just gets expensive.  
Me: But we need to prove it. It does mean that you would be able to control the spend more if it was just a search campaign. But I think you're going to get better results out of doing the PMAX campaign again. That's just my thoughts.  
Them: Yeah. That's fine. Let's test it and then see how they do. And in terms of efficiency, because it's shown across, like, different placements, it may just do better from that perspective.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, definitely. What the business are asking for is to target Aspinall's customers, not necessarily Aspinall's search terms.  
Them: Okay? Yep.  
Me: So we will be achieving the same thing, but in a more efficient way by doing it this way. It's very old. It's very old school just to target a custom competitor's keyword, and it always ends in tears.  
Them: Yep. Welcome back. Yeah. Y. Eah. That's fine. That makes sense. I hope you also don't mind me, like, just asking questions. Just trying to, like, understand your rationale and.  
Me: Go for it. Not at all.  
Them: Cool.  
Me: What it makes me think as well.  
Them: Yes. Good to talk these things out and just understand. So, yeah. Yeah, we're waiting. The assets again for marketing. So I was online till 7pm yesterday trying to get everything live, only for it to be like.  
Me: Ok? Ay. And you know what, Lauren? I know it sounds strange, and I know you're new to the business. But sometimes you just got to take a step on a few toes to get what you want. So not necessarily to get RC with them, but to ask for forgiveness rather than ask for permission. So those asset groups are live. If we had to wait for marketing to come up with the images, they wouldn't be live.  
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.  
Me: So we've got to think what's best for us. I've not looked at the new asset groups.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yet. What do we do? We did Friday, didn't we?  
Them: And then I put in the gifting ones yesterday in the US and uk.  
Me: In their own. Oh, you put them in there, right? I thought we were doing this separate.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I thought we were going to do a separate one.  
Them: So I was good. I was thinking that, but I wasn't sure, so I was like, let me put them in there for now, and then if the volume is good, then separate it out.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: That's my thoughts, but.  
Me: Are they pure gifting or are they Christmas gifting?  
Them: There are mixture. So in the search terms. Like different like products, but also like there's a lot of like luxury gift for her, luxury gift for him, etc, luxury jewelry box gift. Etc. Put that in as well, along with some of the other search things that were already in, like heroes and sidekicks. I wanted to go through on this call, like how to split out the, like, custom groups so that we've only got, like, yes, all our products for her showing and then products for him.  
Me: Ok?  
Them: So. Yeah, but in my original, I had, like, a set, a paid search plan that I'd created, like, a while ago, maybe, like a month ago. And in that plan, I. The original plan was to create a separate gifting campaign. I think it's more like I just need to stand in my decisions and be like, this is what we're doing.  
Me: Well, things changed out there. And you're quite right. At the end of the day, there's neither right nor wrong here. I think we're going to hit our targets based upon what we've already got. That's my hunch. What we're doing here is building for the future as well. So I would be very inclined to say.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Create a christmas pmax campaign. So that if it performs well, And you're there on the 1st of December, you go, and that's doing really well. You can pump more money into Christmas. But then you also have your gifts for him. Gifts for her, which are out of season as well.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So they'll be for birthdays, for anniversaries, for whatever it might be. And you can keep that in that PMAX campaign. Running all year. And it will. It will flex on demand, then. Whereas the Christmas one, you might just. You might. We might be looking at it and we'll say, wow, the roas on that is six and it's four on the other one. Let's. Let's give it a bump. I think there will be more of a difference in conversion rates for the Christmas stuff than there will be for the other stuff. And if it's all in one pmax campaign, that's gonna be quite difficult to allocate. Well, we can't allocate budget, and we might not be getting the most out of it, but you've created a Christmas asset groups. You know, to create a pmax. Now just whack it out there.  
Them: Okay. The my goal.  
Me: And the other thing. If it's pure Christmas.  
Them: With. Yeah.  
Me: And they don't exist at any other time, then those products won't actually have a history yet. Now. I don't think they are. They will sit in other place and we'll talk about that in a minute. But if it was just pure Christmas, you don't want to segment it by heroes and psychics because it's had no demand prior to that. So that's another reason for having a campaign on its own that you might want to. You'd be going, okay, well, it's only got a two row ass, but it has only just started. And we do know it's gonna, it's gonna jump up. So, you know, this, this, this pros. And cons now. I'll segue into this now in the fact that we've got this segmentation on products. Now. The way in which the segmentation is. Well, we've got here as a sidekicks for villains and zombies, they're all being dealt with as one in product here. So they can only sit in one of those segments. So they can't exist in more than one of them. So there's a custom label in there. A couple of years, I think it's custom label for or something. And it will say one or the other hero, psychics, villains and zombies. Okay? So what I've done with the other products, like travel bags. There is no travel bags category, and this is absolutely something that needs to be dressed after Christmas. Of this product categorization and how we can access that going forward, because there needs to be. Sorry.  
Them: Sorry. So right now, like, In, I guess, merch and center. Or is it feed optimized? We're not able to categorize things into the what we want it to be.  
Me: What do you do? Yes, they are, but they're not granular. They don't match. What? They don't match what the navigation is. So if we look at a particular page. Oh, that'd be nice. We can't actually do it.  
Them: Right, okay. Yeah.  
Me: It doesn't go down low enough. Travel bags. There is no categorization for travel bags. Right down to a level. So that's something that's got to be done in the new year. So for now, What I've done in order to get these. Asset groups up and running. I'm just looking now. On something like the travel bags, notebooks, travel bags. Right. Stationary. They're starting to work. So what I've done with those, like, jewelry boxes and rolls, they should do quite nicely at Christmas. So I've created a supplemental feed within Merchant center that lists the id. So the same way as you've just done with your listing groups, you've gone and found all the IDS for a particular category.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And you're implicitly putting them into the listing group. So you've now got a list of product ids, I presume you just got CSV and just drop them all in.  
Them: No, I actually just searched for, like, a keyword, like jewelry box, and then just selected everything.  
Me: Okay? Okay. Yeah, that's one way to do it. Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's fine. But we can't apply here, as in psychics to that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I've created this supplemental feed. Which is a g sheet. And it just has all the, it has the, the. The product IDS in there that I want to categorize in a particular place. And then it has custom label zero as another, as another. Column. And I've uploaded that into Merchant center, and that's how it sets that label for that product.  
Them: Okay? Sick. So it's applied the custom label to those products, essentially.  
Me: Yes. The virus metal feed. It's quick and dirty.  
Them: Okay? O. Kay.  
Me: It's not necessarily. There's no de juping or anything in there. So we'll have a. We'll have a travel bag which might sit in a gift for her, which might sit in a leather goods, you know, so. But it can only be one value. It can only be one of those, so. It's not. It's not foolproof. But what it means is we can then select that custom label zero and say, I want travel bags. Heroes and sidekicks below it. We can nest the listing group. Let me show you what I mean.  
Them: Yeah. So I'm guessing on the first level you'd have the custom label, and then the second level would be the Heroes.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, okay. Sorry. Just to circle back to the Christmas campaign quickly. You essentially seeing that like Christmas Company may perform better than our HNS PMAX campaign. And that's why it may be a good idea to move those asset groups out.  
Me: I'm presuming that's my assumption that perform better.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.  
Me: And then we could tweak it. You know, we can. We can tweak the budgets between the different campaigns. Then if we got to the 5th of December or something, the Christmas gifts one's doing, well, then we can turn that up more than we can another one. Because what I'm hoping to do. Is to create something that says, okay, look at the performance the last seven days. We've got this budget left. How should we be moving it around and how should we be moving the. The target rises around to hit the strategy that we wanted.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And if we have that pmax credence campaign, we don't really need a search campaign because it will be covered by pmax anyway.  
Me: Yes, it will.  
Them: I think, yeah.  
Me: Yeah. It will take up quicker as well.  
Them: So. Okay?  
Me: You know, to actually do a search campaign for Christmas gifts would be suicide, I think. Because it's about a thousand other people want to be doing that at the same time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So.  
Them: Should I start recording from here?  
Me: Oh, I thought you'd do it already. Yeah, go for it. Good afternoon.  
Them: Cool. There we go.  
Me: So we're in data sources. Sorry, we're in Merchant Center. Data sources. So there's a lot of primary sources, which is all the feed optimize. This is another job that all needs. Doing? These all need tidy up. These are rubbish. Everyone's. Everyone's been frightened to death of changing these. These don't do anything at all, these primary fees. You know, something's uploading them because the last update date has changed, but I really don't think they do anything. But what I'm interested in is the supplemental sources. So.  
Them: And there's supplemental. Sorry.  
Me: Supplemental.  
Them: The supplemental sources are the ones that update from Product Hero every, every day.  
Me: Amongst other things. Yep, yep.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So again, there's 151 of these. Black Friday 22. Oh, what a nightmare. You know, there shouldn't be 151 of these. Knocking around summer 20. And the thing is, I know what's happened here. Someone's been too lazy to do anything with it. They don't. They don't see it as a. As a job. Because if you go into this summer 20, which has been paused probably since 2020, you click on the little delete supplemental source. Button on the side here. It'll say it's already been attached to a primary feed, so you have to unap attach it before you can delete it. And people are looking, and I go, I have no idea how to do that. So they just left it. But ideally, that needs. That needs doing. Anyway, I'm. I'm digressing. So I've created custom labels. 0Q4, 20, 25. I think it's pretty clear what that actually is. So if I click into that. It's telling me that there are 117 products I've tried to update 107 that are matched. So there's 10 that haven't matched on ID. I'm not too fussed about that sort of number. If you look at the data source setup, I've created this file here. Smythe and custom label 0Q4 2025 CSV and that contains. A list of ids. And their custom label zeros. So when this is pulled in, the products will be updated with that custom label. Okay?  
Them: So you know how you've got different. Sorry, you've got different product groups, so you've got, like, travel bags, stationary.  
Me: Now.  
Them: They're not all under the same custom label zero, are they?  
Me: Yes. Well, they're in the same. They're in the same sheet.  
Them: Are. Okay? Oh, sorry. But under Custom Label Zero, you've got, like, different categories.  
Me: Yes. Yeah, I'm just going to show you that now because I think. I mean, this is down as a CSV you can actually use for supplemental fee. A supplemental fees? A G sheet.  
Them: Got it? Yeah. Cool.  
Me: You know, there's a potential. We could actually share that then if we did it as a G sheet. That's just coming to my head now, so I think I'll do that. I'll update that to be a G sheet. That's an action on me to do that. And I'm going to try and show you. What that file actually looks like now. Where? Did I put it? Welcome to my world here. Lauren.  
Them: So many folders.  
Me: So. It smooths and. There it is. So this is the. This is the file. It's just got ID at the top and custom label zero. So in the same way as you cut and pasted. Your IDS into that listing group. I've put them in here. And I've put this custom label zero against it.  
Them: Got it? Yeah.  
Me: So that when I go and look at. When I go and look at a product. Now. These have been pulled in. I've got labels set here. Okay? So if I search on labels. It was previously used for sale, this. But, I mean, we're not using it anywhere. So you can see, custom label zero here has these values. So I've done one for jewelry boxes, cardholders, and travel bags. If I click on travel bags, Those are all the products that we're advertising in that asset group. Okay?  
Them: How did you get all the IDs into the different. In your. In your gc? How did you kind of, like, apply the ID to the right groups? Did you have to, like, fill? Did you filter first and then just copy all of the IDs?  
Me: I wanted. This is the difficult bit now. I'll explain this, but you can obviously do it in whatever way you want. I've used AI. I've scraped the page. And then I've compared the name of the product to an API into Merchant center, which produces the product id. And so we just gave me a list of product IDs of all the products on that page. You did ask me.  
Them: Okay. Paid from the website.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Yeah, okay.  
Me: So that's a step too far. Pretty much. You know what you're doing at the moment? By doing your listing groups or even in here. You could. You could go in here. And say, Title.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. And then you contains. Pen set. There are any. But you know what I mean. You could. So it would. It will produce then a list of IDS for you. These. These appends. And pencils if you wanted a group. And pens and pencils. There you go. There's 259 of them.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You'd go up to here. Download, stick it in a file.  
Them: Put the custom name.  
Me: Pull out the id, put it into that G sheet, and away you go. Now, please remember, this is quick and dirty. We shouldn't. We shouldn't necessarily need to be doing this, but it gets us what we want. Right now.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In six weeks before d day.  
Them: Y.  
Me: Or C day, whatever you want to call it. So at least it gives you those product ids. We can use those in those asset groups, which means we can, we can break things out into smaller groups, port more relevant assets against them adds and images, and potentially increase the, the, the ctr. So that's why I'M doing it this way. You know, it's. It's needs must right now. And you will get a situation where if you imagine that Google's scanning down that G sheet,  
Them: Eah, yeah.  
Me: And it's going that ID is that label. That ID is that late. That id. Oh, we've already got that ID up there. Oh, it's going to be that label now. So it might not sit in the same one anymore. It might be gifts for her and travel bags. So try and keep those. Those groupings down small. So we reduce the fact it's going to be. It's. It's not going to necessarily appear in the group that we want, but it doesn't matter. Just because that, you know, when we, when we're looking at that product, it could well be in that category. It could be a bag, it could be a travel bag. So it's still going to go relevant asset text against it.  
Them: So it. Can't. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, for that asset group.  
Them: So we can't. We can't have. The product IDS into asset groups at the same time.  
Me: You can have them in the same. Have them in different asset groups.  
Them: Oh, sorry. Same product group.  
Me: But it's how you identify them. You see, it's like. It's like stationary. There is actually a category called stationary. So I've been able to do stationary. And if it's pure stationary, not a problem at all, it'll go away and do it. But with something like stationary, the, the. The criteria I've used in the. In the asset group is, I think it was product type. You can actually drill down a product and get to stationary. It's quite a big, quite a big group. So that will sit in one asset group. And another asset group, it might have pens and pencils, which is also stationary. But that's in the pens and pencils group. It doesn't matter.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It doesn't matter if you're it doesn't matter it appearing in more than one because at the end of the day, Google will decide sooner or later which is the best which is the best one to display it, and if it's showing intent that someone's looking for stationery rather than pens and pencils. It might appear in that one.  
Them: Okay? Yeah.  
Me: Because that's going to be more generic text. But if there's specific looking for a pen or a pencil, it's more likely to relevance sake. It's more likely to appear for that the pens and pencils asset group.  
Them: But with a feed. You know how you mention, like, if it. If Google sees the same id, like at the top, and then it keeps scanning down and then it sees the same ID again. And at first it had been categorized and travel bags, but now we also want it to be in gifts for her.  
Me: Yeah, it just helped.  
Them: Will. That. Oh, so it can't be both.  
Me: My thought it was overwrite it with the last one.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Now? I don't know, Google. Google might read from the bottom up. I don't know. You might read it in alphabetical. I don't know the way it does it, but it will only set custom labels. Zero to one of those values.  
Them: I guess that just means that, like, so there'll be some products missing. But.  
Me: Well, they won't be. There will be no products missing because we always, we always have a captual campaign. We always have the H and S campaign, which is your top level one, which is your catch all.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So it'll never drop through the gaps. You know, we're not. We're not. We're not looking for a perfect world here where each product only appears in one asset group. We're actually looking for a mix and match of asset groups that work, you know, it will work better for one product than another product.  
Them: Cool. So with these, like the travel bag, stationary notebooks. We're not applying heroes and sidekicks to those.  
Me: Well, this means we can. We can apply it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Right now I've not done, but we can apply it if I go to.  
Them: I'm just thinking, is it a good idea to based on that volume?  
Me: Well, I don't. And this, this is the next, this is the next stage of the analysis is to actually look at this and see whether it is now worth breaking down into here as a sidekicks. The idea was just to get these things running at this stage.  
Them: Yeah. That makes sense.  
Me: We've got pmax, h&s. This is where all the money's going anyway.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If I look at specifically one, which I did, which was cardholders. Don't ask me why I did card holders, it seemed to be quite high volume. So card holders is now in there. If I look at the way this is broken down, it was done on custom labels there and it's picked card holders. So which is what we just seen in Merchant Center. Then if I go to card holders here. And look at custom label 4 is it? No. Three. I could then do that.  
Them: An overlay? Yeah. But yeah, that makes sense. And then it will push the heroes and psychics.  
Me: Correct. Now, that's probably not a bad idea. But the one conversion on it has been on everything else. It wasn't a mean it might be now.  
Them: Yeah. When really.  
Me: On it. And this is why, just to run it through a little bit, just, you know, because it might become a hero and psychic, just because you've got more relevant assets on there. So I would say let's draw a line in the sand that from Friday, say we go back into PMAX here as a psychics and say, right, let's apply heroes and psychics to everything now. But we're not going to be able to do that. If it's a done on product ids, it has to be done on some sort of grouping like we've got with the card holders here.  
Them: That? Yeah. I see. Also, it has to be within, like, custom labels.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: It can't be on the categories.  
Me: Yes. If we look at what was one you did gifting. For.  
Them: Yeah, I'll gift him for him.  
Me: Okay, if I look at the listing group there?  
Them: I've just had to apply everything at the moment.  
Me: Was one we had.  
Them: Which.  
Me: Ids in it.  
Them: Might. Might be the us ones.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So we can do the same with the US Here as well. Because when you, when you're applying the supplemental feed, it asks you which country you want to be in. Now, the product ID is the same across countries, aren't they?  
Them: They should be.  
Me: Okay, so if they are, we can use the same supplemental feed for the US and the UK I just create a copy of it, you know, one for the US One, so we. We know what the difference is. But I don't need to recreate it. It'll be the same. It'd be the same. IDs, but just pointing at a different country.  
Them: Just double check. I know that, like, in Germany. What? The products in, like, German.  
Me: I'll check it. It's fine. Yeah, I mean, we can check that anyway by looking at that one. That is a notebook. If I look here.  
Them: Y. Yeah, I'm thinking he's a notebook.  
Me: If I look here and go to. I've got a feeling they are the same ids. I think I've looked at this before. Oh, come on. Yeah, there you go. Us and uk is the same. So this here, this campaign here, when I've uploaded the spreadsheet, we can use that same grouping. But if you look at. If you look at this, we can't. We can't. We'd have to go through.  
Them: In. The us.  
Me: And do we say it's two? Three. It's a zombie, that one. That that particular one is a zombie. So then we'd have to go to the next one, see what that group's in. So instead of that, we have a grouping at the top, which is all of them, and then split it down to here with the sidekicks below that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That makes sense.  
Me: I'm happy to do that. I'll. If. If. What I'll do is, I'll. I'll put that supplemental feed onto a G sheet, let you know where it is. So you can. You can append to it. And then I'll. I'll duplicate it and put it for the US as well. So you'll get. I'll give. I'll give you two URLs. One for the uk, one for the us. And just remember, if you do it on the uk, do it on the US one as well.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So those. Those groupings are available. And then we can replace these with the actual new ones from Custom Label Zero. And then we can apply Heroes and Sidekicks for it. But then let's draw a line in the sand. I would say let's leave it till Monday. If we do it on Monday to go back into these listing groups and say, right, we're just doing here as a psychics from now on. And make sure that these are covered in the Villains and zombies campaigns here. We are actually covering those.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, that's fine. And then also need to create. Like a group for women's gifts under custom label zero. And that gives his gifts. Yes.  
Me: Is there nothing for that? There won't be.  
Them: There's, like, a gift. I don't know if it's a category or product group, but I've seen. But there's, like, four things in it. It's very small.  
Me: The. The thing. I'll show you this again. Now, these custom labels have been used and abused over the years. If you look at. If you look at these here. We've got low AOV in custom label 0. We've got sale in custom label 4. We don't need these.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You know, so there's a lot we can do. You know, I could. I could just do. Try and create something with. For him and for her. And we could use that in the. The Christmas gifts for him, Christmas gifts for her, so. Because they're all gifts, aren't they?  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: It's not necessarily a gifting kind of thing, so I could use. I could use one of the labels for. For him. Or for her, so that would be definitely one or the other.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? And it wouldn't be on the custom label. Zero beyond the wannabe other labels.  
Me: Yes, yes, I could. As I say, that sale one there, we don't use that. We can use Custom Label 4 for it.  
Them: Okay? So.  
Me: It's going to be difficult because, you know, what is a pen is a pen for him or for her?  
Them: Okay? Yeah. They need to go both. Like.  
Me: Just tip every one second.  
Them: Yeah. No. Worries.  
Me: Oh, he's managed to get it through the post box. Amazing what they'll fit through the post box. So. Right. I'll do that as well. I'll. I'll create a kind of. For him, for her kind of thing. I mean, I could. There is a for him for her section on the website, isn't there? Gifts for him.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Gives.  
Them: It's under christmas. Yeah.  
Me: Right. Well, okay. What I'll do then is I'll scrape that. As. As what? Seem to be gifts for him, gifts for her. So he won't give food everything. So we won't have paper or anything like that Would specifically be gifts.  
Them: Okay? Cool.  
Me: Let's do that instead.  
Them: Yeah, that's fine. And then, because there's already, like, a unisex gift in heroism, a Heroes Inside Kicks asset group has now become a Heroes Inside Kicks gifting. I've just added gifting on and gifting assets, and that's covering everything. Anyway, so anything that's like paper and it's, well, performing will be covered by that.  
Me: So you say that again.  
Them: So the heroes and sidekicks asset group are just like put gifting on the end of it.  
Me: I wouldn't change that. Yeah, I wouldn't change that. Because it's not, is it? That's all the heroes and psychics. If you look at the listing group.  
Them: Yeah, It's Hiro. It's Horizon. Psychic. So it's all products, but, like, all products can be a gift, right? In the sense that, like.  
Me: It's not. Yes. So. So don't put gifting on it. That's because you. You're not. It's. It's not gifting, because if you look at your assets here, These shouldn't be gifts. These should be. These should be generic messaging that we use all year. This is your bog standard. Normal business kind of asset group which contains all your heroes and sidekicks. We should be creating specific gifting. Asset groups. Rather than changing the one that we got at the moment. Because the problem is, when they get to January, it's not a gift anymore, is it? We now need to change it all back again to what it was originally.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That it's a generic Eras and Sidekicks asset group.  
Them: Yeah. Oh, okay. I mean, I didn't think there was an issue of, like, just changing things back afterwards. My thought process was more.  
Me: You called yourself work.  
Them: Yeah, I got what you mean.  
Me: Doing, set in stone, continually accruing history about your heroes and sidekicks. And then you have things like your gifting for her, gifting for him.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Are specific gifting assets. And you're also changing your audiences. Your audiences will be related to gifting. They won't be related to Smythes and stationery, which is what this one is here. It needs to be. It needs to be channeled towards. The sort of people you want and what message you want to give to them.  
Them: I go evening. I think my proposals just that because, like, in the we're in a gifting season, people are still going to buy because they're going to buy. And so we're still pushing, like, what we classify as heroes and sidekicks, regardless.  
Me: Absolutely. So we so we keep doing that with our existing campaign, but also this with our existing asset group. But this time of year, we want to change this audience signal.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: We don't want it to be gifting. This audience signal is about people who want to buy stationery. So we create another asset group.  
Them: And. Other things.  
Me: We create another asset group which has search themes around gifting and we have an audience signal around gifting.  
Them: Right.  
Me: They are two completely different things.  
Them: Okay, I get what I mean. Yeah.  
Me: So this.  
Them: Rather than combining them.  
Me: Yes. So this what. What you. As I say, what you're doing is you're giving yourself a load of hassle here because in January you have to go back and change all that. Because it's not gifting.  
Them: Yeah, I get what you mean. It's kind of like now, what would go in the place of it? Because, like, I know you don't want to hear this, but as a business, the messaging that they want us to push is all about Christmas. There's nothing else.  
Me: Yeah. If people want to buy Christmas things, they can do. But there are people who want to buy a pen. I want to buy a pen. A Christmas gift. I don't want a Christmas gift, so I want to buy a pen. The message for us is relevance.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Is relevance for what someone's actually searching for. You could put a Christmas gifts site linking. You could put a Christmas gift headlining somewhere.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That if, you know, if someone did want that and then all you have to do is change that particular thing. But this is the problem. In the past, when there's been a sale, it is being full on sale. We've got a sale. We've got a sale. We got to say, I just want to buy a pen.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Do you do pens? I can't see any wording on there that says that you do pens. You're just blasting me with Christmas gifts.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.  
Me: So your response to marketing is, that's fine. We've got a Christmas gift, asset groups. We've got gifts for him, gifts for her, Christmas gifts. That's fine. Yeah, we've done that. We've also got travel bags.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We've also got pens, we've also got notebooks, we've also got stationery. And they. They will resonate with the people who are only looking for that thing. This is far more intelligent than marketing thinks it actually is because we're using audience groups to target these people.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's not just about. We've got. It's not just like going to the front window of Smythson's and putting Christmas gifts and hiding everything behind it. That wouldn't work, would it?  
Them: Yeah. You want to still fix some people who just want to buy things because that's what they're looking for.  
Me: Correct. Which have worked all year round. And what we're trying to do is make some money for the business.  
Them: Like.  
Me: Now, these little images and stuff. Yeah, they could be. They could be Christmas related. That's fine. That's not a problem. It, you know, tells people Christmas gifts, but. But not the text. Definitely not the text.  
Them: For the text. Yeah.  
Me: I absolutely wouldn't have that text on that asset group.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Absolutely. Not, you know, because. Because, of course, the other thing is that for the last three months, it's had those asset text, it's had those audiences, it's learnt.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then all of a sudden, you're taking that asset text away and you're going, what the hell? What do I. What do I do now? It's. It doesn't go into learning, but it has to relearn all those headlines as to when to actually show them to people. We want consistency. And with the asset text, we want consistency to the. To the effect that every month or so we go back into the asset text, what's working, what's not working. If it's not working, take it out, let's replace it, but leave the good ones in.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You know, because they are actually, there are actually converts. They're giving us a click through rate and they are actually converting when people come through to the website. I get too passionate about Google Ads. I'm sorry, Lauren. I don't. I probably come across as a bit aggressive sometimes, but I really love this stuff. I absolutely love it. And believe it or not, I'm trying. I'm. I'm help. I'm trying to help. I'm trying to. Pass on my experience with it to you. Don't read it. I'm being aggressive. Please don't. I am a people person, honestly.  
Them: Yeah. That's okay. Now I know.  
Me: So please take it in the way it's intended. This is an education thing, you know. Hopefully, this will. This will hold you in good stead in the future, whether you believe it or not. You could come off the call.  
Them: Yeah, it's okay. Yeah. No, it. Will.  
Me: Rubbish. But, you know, I'm trying to just pass on a little bit of experience, that's all. And that. I mean, that's a. That's a prime example. I would seriously put that text back to what it was.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: Wherever it is.  
Them: Yeah, I'm just like. Where is it?  
Me: You know what? There's the marketing spreadsheet where it was populated with headlines in descriptions. The first time I changed that, I populated it with the headlines and description lines. Or Alex will have a copy of it and it will tell you what the original ones were.  
Them: 's fine. It will be in our HNS campaigns that we paused.  
Me: Of course. Could be. Yeah, it could be. Yes, it will. Because there was new customers in return. Good thinking.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Well done.  
Them: Yeah. So I'll just take it from there.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: And then I'll create. I guess I'll create a unisex gifting campaign as well as her and him.  
Me: Yes. Yes.  
Them: And that will go in a separate Christmas campaign.  
Me: That's great. Yeah. Duplicate that hns asset group. And call it h and s gifting.  
Them: But in the Christmas campaign.  
Me: Create. Save all that text you've got. Don't be tempted to go. I'll just create a new one which is just the standard hs. The HNS one has got history, so you want to preserve that by changing this text back again. But before you do,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Cut and paste this as a new asset group.  
Them: Copy.  
Me: And just rename.  
Them: Enter.  
Me: Yeah, good thing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, good thinking. And then that will be gifting. And then you got another one, which is Christmas gifts. But go into your audience signals when you've done the new HNS gifting one and change your audience signals to people who are looking for gifts. Yeah. So we target.  
Them: Sorry. So it's going to be a Christmas.  
Me: Audience.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it's going to be a gifting. There's going to be Christmas gifts.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then Christmas gifts for him, and then at Christmas gifts for her, and then a separate gift in for like other gift moments around the year.  
Me: Y. Eah. Yeah.  
Them: And. But those will all go into one separate campaign.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Okay? So four asset groups.  
Me: Not into a separate campaign. No, not into a separate campaign. You're gifting asset. Groups will be all year. You know you're not being specific about the occasion, so leave those in this existing PMAX campaign to attract people who are looking for a gift.  
Them: Yeah. The gifting. Gift for him and gift for her.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So your Christmas gifts. Christmas gifts to him. Christmas gifts for her and you. Asset groups in a new campaign. Which is purely to do with Christmas.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So that we can adjust the budget.  
Them: Okay? That makes sense.  
Me: If we need to. If that does particularly well or particularly badly, we can adjust the budget accordingly. We could change the target row. I'll ask on that as well. If we wanted to.  
Them: I think. There might be a existing gift in a secret. I feel like I've seen you.  
Me: If it's a very old one, it won't be worth having.  
Them: Oh, no.  
Me: They were a bit dire, the original ones. Again, you can. You can copy and paste your current pmax just, you know, if you do it in Google Ads editor, delete. The so if you if you create your gifting ones in the PMAX hns. And then Google Ads editor download it all created cut and paste the pmax h&s. Call it pmax h&s christmas. And then delete all the asset groups which are non gifting. Rename the gifting asset groups to be Christmas. Gifting. And then just change your text in there and then load it back up again. Do you use? Do you use Ads editor a lot?  
Them: Yeah, I do.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Saves you so much time.  
Them: Yeah. Because I was doing it like sight links yesterday. The Christmas sacks. Cool. So there'll be three asset group, Christmas asset groups, and a new campaign. And then a gift for him and a gift for her asset group. Two asset groups in the original H and S emacs campaign.  
Me: Yep. Yep.  
Them: But. But those won't be live at the moment. Right, because they're going to compete with the Christmas campaign.  
Me: It doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter. Because we're going to have different audiences for all of them. You're not mentioning Christmas in the gifting ones. The asset groups within the HMS campaign.  
Them: Right. They're just for general gifts because. Yeah, that's. Myson offers just general gifts all year round anyway. Cool.  
Me: Yes. Correct. So in January we can keep it going. If it works.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If it works. If it doesn't, then we'll ben it.  
Them: Yeah. Because people buy, like, birthday gifts, anniversary gifts, all that kind of stuff. Thank you. That will make sense.  
Me: Briefcases Ones do well, isn't it 473 roas.  
Them: Yeah, it's too long. So I'm gonna reactivate the other briefcases campaigns.  
Me: Wow.  
Them: But I was thinking only to reactivate the ones that had done well. In October, but I feel like maybe we should give the other ones a chance again. Just see how it does.  
Me: Create new asset groups in that same PMAX campaign.  
Them: Oh, but like, for other markets, I mean. Like, so we.  
Me: For us and stuff.  
Them: Yeah. So there's a US Badge campaign for returning customers. And she just brads now. And that has a briefcase has Asset Group in it. So the US and the UK are fine. It's more so like Germany, France, Italy, Australia and Singapore, where I've created briefcases campaigns and they didn't really perform at all.  
Me: Okay? I think there's enough capacity in those accounts without that.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: It's too much of a high AOV to drop into those more extreme. Not extreme, but those remoter places. I mean, it might work in the US where the brand is stronger. But if you think. With the european. Campaigns. We're not granular enough yet on the actual countries. So if we create a pmax, With men's briefcases in our bags. It's going to appear in a number of different locations, quite diverse locations, and the actual learnings from it are going to be quite slim. This is. The UK and the US are doing well because there's enough traffic in them and they're actually conversions, but. If you think like Europe, it's going to go out to, I don't know, Spain, Belgium, France, wherever it might be, it's very diluted.  
Them: But for example, with the. There's like a Germany specific one. It's only targeting people in Germany and it's only as in a German feed. Would that be okay? Like, that's what I've done for, like, the campaigns I've created, so they're not, like, targeting every single country. Invokes in europe. Maybe you just search for briefcases. It should.  
Me: We've got German shopping one.  
Them: Come up.  
Me: See, it's looking at the other ones and seeing how they're doing. If you look at the Germany shopping.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The ROAS is 0.58 just on straightforward shopping. The way I visualize it is the fact that the station is going to work first because it's lower aov, and then it'll be things like leatherbacks and stuff. And if the shopping ones not doing particularly well to then launch a bags one on top of that. I think it's going to be a self fulfilling prophecy. It's not going to do particularly well.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The shop. The German shopping one is £20 a day. That we're giving it a bag is 300 quid. It's going to be a lower conversion rate. I don't think the conversion rate on the European side of things is strong enough to be able to support that actually converting. And if you look at the. If you look at your budget for Europe and how well the existing campaigns are doing what they're giving us, we're getting the seven roas, and they're limited by budget. Do we need to do a lot more on the European one? Do we need to get more granular at that this particular place and time? To be able to hit roas targets. I don't think we do. We need to smarten up the campaigns that we've got at the moment. They've all gone to AI Max, which seems to be working well. We've got the Gran Diaries and organizers. Good. We're capturing the seasonal stuff with the diaries in those particular countries across the board. And again, that's doing well. 6.9 and 18. It's only on four conversions, but we need to be pumping more money into those than creating a new pmax. Campaign specifically for bags that is going to have an indeterminate performance.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I've been more inclined to just ramp up the budgets on those existing campaigns.  
Them: If the campaign generated some. Conversions and so did Australians. Sorry. If you just search for campaigning contains briefcase, there's like some conversion value there, but it is quite small. But it's something. Another one. Another one of my ideas was to create pmax campaigns. For. For the European markets.  
Me: You wrote your European market. Sorry, Long. Will you just excuse me one second?  
Them: Stories.  
Me: If you look at your budget for Europe, Where would you rather be spending the money? To gain the roas. I don't think it's on a pmax. Full briefcases. Because you would have to increase your budget. You would have to use a lot of the budget for that one particular campaign in order to get a conversion. So I think the money will be better spent on the existing campaigns and building those out more. Than creating new pmax campaigns for bags.  
Them: Okay? Can you see the France and Italy campaigns as well? They're a bit higher. But I get what you mean.  
Me: For the not shopping, are they?  
Them: No, the pmax.  
Me: I think. Well, I can't remember what the percentage is now. It's like about 5% or something for Europe.  
Them: For, like, second moon. Yeah. I mean. We can, like, be flexible as to, like, where things are performing better, so.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: If we find that, like, there's. There's better performance in Europe, we could spend more in Europe.  
Me: On the existing campaigns. The existing campaigns are all limited by budget.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Most of them we could double. The spend immediately. Because they're limited by budget.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And they have a track record of converting at a decent roas. So why would we not do that?  
Them: What would you classify as a decent roas?  
Me: Well, the whole of the Europe campaign in the last seven days is about seven.  
Them: Like.  
Me: The rest of europe's search brand AI. Is bringing in a 1000% roas. On 60 quid a day. That can go up to 97 immediately. And still would still probably produce about an 800, which is way beyond where we could get with anything else.  
Them: You connect your screen. Oh, yeah. See what you mean. Yeah.  
Me: See, that one is 40 quid a day. It could go up to 92.  
Them: I go in? I'm just thinking about where we can, like.  
Me: So.  
Them: Scale some of what we're doing in the UK and the US into Europe. One of my ideas was creating, like, a PMAX campaign for, like. Well, we don't have a diary PMAX campaign for, like, France. It's all, like, just a search campaign for France, Italy and Germany. We've got it for Roussel. But I realize. I don't think those campaigns carbon markets. But then I was thinking, if we can, like, push, like, gifts and diaries in the same PMAX campaign, like, put them in different asset groups. That could work. Potentially you'd like something to test?  
Me: I just think it's a lot of efforts. For something that's not going to bring. A contribution to the performance of that account this year.  
Them: But how do we know that it won't bring.  
Me: Do you want to gamble?  
Them: Like.  
Me: Do you want to just say, I'm going to roll the dice, or do you want to put money into campaigns that are actually working, are actually producing a roas? If you look at the strategy going forward, how much extra money we've got,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: For Europe. Say we had an extra 100 pounds a day. Where would you put it? In a PMAX campaign for bags or whatever? That is brand new. It's going to go into learning. It's going to have 30 days before it actually does anything at all. Or into a search campaign that's working. It's actually producing a very, very high roas.  
Them: Yeah, I think it makes sense to put it into what's working. But then you also want to push, like, things that are doing how we've seen you well in other markets and try and replicate that if possible. Use the test, right?  
Me: But it's not as critical to the business to actually generate a huge amount of money. I would totally agree with doing a pmax campaigns or something. When we come into the New Year and we have the time to do it. And we can play around with when we can play around with the budget. We're in the kill zone now. We need to make as much money as possible, as high roas as possible.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So therefore, fish where the fish are. Rather than go and pick your rod up and go to another pond and go and see, just speculatively where they will work or not, I say UK's campaign up now, it'll be 30 days before it actually comes out of learning. And by then you've spent a load of money.  
Them: It's like, what, like seven days max? Like we've seen with the new asset groups.  
Me: Google will say give it 30 days before it starts to produce the level of performance that you would expect it to do going forward.  
Them: For.  
Me: And we're in November. So we're using, you know, we're using November to do some experimentation, whereas we should be just looking at what is actually working at the moment. You know, the things that we're doing with the PMAX campaign for the UK is we're just adding asset groups, we're just giving it a little bit of a new angle on things and some new text breaking out into different groups. The Christmas campaign, yes, that's going to be a gamble. But you're already covering all those products in the other campaign anyway, so it's less of a gamble doing that. But what we're doing is we're introducing brand new products into this market that don't have a recent history. So they've all got to start from fresh. And what you're doing is sacrificing that spend on those campaigns. For the sake of another campaign which will absolutely bring in your revenue.  
Them: Yeah, I understand. Even.  
Me: But quite right. I mean, in Europe, it's been my argument in the past to say, like, raster world, in Europe, we should be pushing these and seeing what works and what doesn't work by doing experimentation. I just don't think now's the time to experiment. The new guys have put some money into it. What you do with that money? I would just explain around him with this. What the hell, Just make me some money.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then we'll have the discussion afterwards whether it was all brand. And the argument for that is that the SEO for rest of the world isn't particularly good. So if someone put Smite in, they wouldn't necessarily see the Smyson website being displayed in the results.  
Them: I get what you mean. Like, killed all of my ideas. It's okay.  
Me: Well, no, it's not good. I very rarely get this opportunity to actually talk about the campaigns. It all just goes on in my head. Or I just talk to AI. That's the sort of person I am, so it's good to discuss them. And not just knock them out at court. Come up with a reason discussion behind it. So that if Seb says you, why haven't you done a bags campaign in Europe? Well, because there was unspent budget in Europe that was generating a revenue and he'll go, fine, that's not a problem. So it's about arming you as well for these kinds of discussions.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I mean, this is great doing these brands and organizers type.  
Them: One of my.  
Me: Campaigns because we're covering off something that we're coming into peak and this is already producing at half decent roas. So that's fantastic. Doing that target, something that we know is going to sell. At this time of year. And that can do nothing but improve as we get towards Christmas and beyond, into January. There's not a lot else we can do. Then. An exercise on this to. Look at which countries are actually converting and if.  
Them: Look at that sometimes just to like, look at if there's any countries we could.  
Me: I'd split that out.  
Them: Create specific campaigns for.  
Me: I'd take Australia out and put it into a new campaign.  
Them: Brand, AI.  
Me: Yeah. Because if you look at how many conversions the 131, 45 is a third is of the conversion. So if you take Australia out, then there will still be enough conversions in there for that to work properly. That campaign. And then over time, you know, you can push shunts, the budget around between, you know, if you wanted to put more into Australian than the rest of them, so you'll have the rest of the world that can probably go that one. I'd get rid of the misspellings. One, it'll be covered in brand. Diaries and organizes. It's a case of keeping on top of that one. To see whether that does the same thing. Where are. These. That's weird, isn't it? So there's nothing to do with Australia at all? So that gives you a bit of insight as well. So there's not enough conversions in there just to create a South Africa diaries campaign, but it's worth keeping abreast of that. What's happening? And also to see whether there's a load of money being spent needlessly.  
Them: Here.  
Me: It's not really long. 39 quid over. 30 days for Canada. I think these kind of things, it would be better to look at all campaigns. As to where the money's been wasted. Canada. £719. On the search campaign to bring back six conversions that are 106. Roas. Now you're in a fantastic position where you are to go and speak to somebody in sales or marketing and say, what's going on in Canada? Then is there, is there a barrier to purchase for Canada? Is it high delivery rates? Is it, you know, that they don't. I don't know. That there's a smart meat packers in Canada and they're mistaking it for something else. But that's a lot of money to spend just for six conversions. And he's almost shouting out to be stopped. It's the same with the uae. That's even worse. You know that's a 0.62. So, you know, this is. This is again, another exercise. Australia. Isn't it weird? Look at that. So that's your briefcases. One for Australia.  
Them: Yeah, that really didn't do well.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. But isn't it interesting that that's yet on brand? It's really strong if they're just looking for Smysons. It's a really strong campaign if they're looking for specific products. It's not.  
Them: I guess because the AOV is high, it takes longer for the person to convert. So it's like you have to spend more money and kind of wait longer.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: But it's like.  
Me: But how long do you wait?  
Them: Yeah, exactly.  
Me: You know?  
Them: And from that test.  
Me: The ccr. Look at that. Ctr is really low. But it's not a brand campaign. These are all brand campaigns. So they're going to be. They're going to be higher.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then the conversion rate is very poor, not 42. Gosh, it's only 30 days. So we're going to, we're going to really attack it from both sides. Is increasing the revenue, but also watching behind you as to what your spend is and are you wasting money on particular things, and countries are a really good example of that.  
Them: Yeah. So just reiterate with the pmax campaigns for like rest of world in Europe. It's just best to kind of focus on what's working at the moment, rather than trying to scale what goes on in the UK and US into the. Into these kind of markets where our brand's not as strong.  
Me: Look at that. You can. You can treble this bend on rest of the world.  
Them: What does it say in terms of the expected conversion value from it?  
Me: Well, it's whatever you. Whatever you set as your roas, isn't that. So well, it's saying that it will spend £210 and achieve. 340% roas.  
Them: Like on the limited by budget, it sometimes shows you, but also. But also, like sometimes by increasing the budget, it doesn't always return what I've asked it to.  
Me: No. It won't. No, it won't do. So you got to be careful. You know, you can't. You can't take it all as all as red. Because that's saying there's only going to be 11 conversions for that amount. This is absolute rubbish.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: It really is.  
Them: Helpful. And. Yeah, definitely.  
Me: If you. If you nut, you don't make a Note, we're on 421 already.  
Them: But not.  
Me: On that. It's the best. It's the best roas across all the campaigns in the last 30 days, so well worth lifting that up. Is that improving? So I've got seven days. Look at that. It might have been one order, but that's improved massively over the last seven days. So if you think the rest of the world the delivery times are going to be longer. Would people would the cut off on that? Be quicker. Than. Conversion value up 27% and cost down 56. She had a nearly 200% increase in. Roas. So conversions is is down 5%. So it was actually a specific order that did that. Or a number of orders. The ALV has gone through the roof. With staking up that, though. See what happens. I'm going to have to do one. Lauren, I didn't realize what time it was. Sorry. Was there anything else you wanted? To. Cover up.  
Them: Yeah, it was more just. I still feel a bit strongly about Queen gifting campaigns in rest of world in Europe, just because, like, what's the chance of them not doing well? In this season.  
Me: The answer to that is I don't know. And that's the problem, isn't it?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We don't actually know. So what you're going to do is you're going to create a brand new campaign. In rest of the world that's never run before and competing against all those ecom businesses in those countries that doing gifting campaigns.  
Them: I get your logic. I'm just looking. At. So right. We've had a rest of Europe shop in pmax Diaries campaign in the past that ran in like November to December 2023. And that performs strongly, but I guess that's diaries. And we have a search campaign for that. We have a shopping. We have shopping Premacks campaigns that run in, like France, Germany, Italy, Ireland. On PMAX and they all had, like, strong roses above 4. In November to December 2023.  
Me: Bear in mind those Roasies you're looking at in years gone by have probably doubled. So you need to segment it by conversion action as to how.  
Them: They're all one single conversion action, which is the GA4 web purchase. There's no. That's. That's the only conversion action.  
Me: Ok? Just always bear that in mind when you're looking at, you know, if you're looking at historical information, you don't want to get caught out.  
Them: Yeah. So with that in mind, if there's historical data to show that. Pmax campaigns have done well. This time of year. Wouldn't it be good to test again?  
Me: Suggestion for you, then. Why not do a PMAX campaign just for diaries?  
Them: The rest of world. One is pmax diaries. The other ones are just like, generic, generic pmax.  
Me: But we know diaries are going to work this time of year.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So why not create a pmax Diaries campaign for the rest of the world? Or for the two European ones.  
Them: Polit. E. Let me see where this was talked to. Watch journey. Okay. Maybe we could do like. Yeah. Rest of europe or europe.  
Me: Because at least you know.  
Them: Just, like, one thing that's campaign.  
Me: At least you know there's going to be a spike in diaries at this time of year.  
Them: Yeah. And. Then.  
Me: I'm sorry, Lauren. I'm really going to have to go.  
Them: That's fine. I can just catch up with you in a good chat. Or if you're. Do you have any availability later today?  
Me: Ok? Unfortunately not. No, I'm absolutely around today. I'm going to be doing those supplemental feeds today.  
Them: Okay? That's fine.  
Me: And get them loaded up and let you know where they are.  
Them: Okay? Cool. That's fine. If anything, I can just catch up with you in the chat.  
Me: Yeah, sure. Yeah. Anything you need, let me know.  
Them: Cool. Okay, thank you.  
Me: Ok, cheers. Bye.
