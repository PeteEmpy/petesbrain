- -- Full Transcript ---
- 'Me: So you''re going to allocate them automatically to. What''s the fail safe on
  this? Can you email me a summary every week? Of what meeting notes have been put
  against what customers. Hello.'
- 'Them: Great. I just wanted to heaven my headphones, otherwise the whole office
  would have been able to hear you.'
- 'Me: I''m not quite either, am I?'
- 'Them: No, you''re actually very quiet. But I was like, just in case.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve just bought. An AI dictation services. I''ve told you before, it''s
  called whisper flow. And I don''t type a lot now. I actually just talk it through.'
- 'Them: Notes, everything.'
- 'Me: It does voice the text, but in any text box you could possibly think of, even,
  like, a URL bar, it''ll do it. And I''m very conscious that. Hi, Alex. I''m very
  conscious that I want to make it as clear as possible when I''m doing it, so I actually
  bought a boom. Mic, which is literally just here.'
- 'Them: I''ve got a. Alex. Anything else.'
- 'Me: So I''m sat with this right under my nose all day, every day with a keyboard
  in front of me. So my wife says I look like a DJ or something. He''s only the microphone
  that makes me look like a dj. Make that clear.'
- 'Them: So. On your paid search decks.'
- 'Me: Yes, that''s right.'
- 'Them: Just pressing button. No, it''s probably, like, really useful. It probably
  saves a lot of time. I need to find something like that because I know like Google
  reps or other media owners, they tend to use that.'
- 'Me: Yeah. It''s massive, Lauren. It''s absolutely massive. I had a meeting this
  morning at quarter past five. It was with someone in Australia, an AI course that
  I''m doing. And his courses are okay, but he does tell you stuff like that. It''s
  like at the moment I''m recording this with. I need to say that now. Don''t I like
  the Google reps, do I? You don''t mind if I record this meeting, do you? But I''ve
  literally just written a little script. At the end of this meeting, it will take
  that and drop it into the Smyson folder so that I can refer to this in the future.'
- 'Them: One.'
- 'Me: Or the AI will refer to it in the future. Said, are there any action plans
  that you have at the moment? And it''ll go. Look at all my clients say, well, yeah,
  we said you were going to do this, we''re going to do that, follow this up.'
- 'Them: To use the Frontier sales to.'
- 'Me: Absolutely incredible. Behind this screen now got on teams. It''s got three
  processes running which are creating AI procedures. Stuff like that. It looks at
  all the emails. It''ll take the emails details into against the client. So I''m
  not missing anything at all.'
- 'Them: Stop tv. It''s something you pay for. This is all.'
- 'Me: But it''s basically when you get up past five. Whisper flow is $10 a month.
  No, it''s not. For the amount it saves, you say 135 words per minute. I can talk
  and it will do it. It will keep up with that. I think. Well, Claude, I''m paying
  80 pound a month for which is worth every single penny. It''s like having half a
  dozen VAs working for you. And I use cursor, which it''s for doing code. So. Which
  sounds really techy, but you just say, I want to be able to do this. This is a repetitive
  task that I do every month. I have to create this spreadsheet based upon last month''s
  data. Can you go and do it for me? And it''s a repetitive thing, but every time
  you refer to that in the future, it will know what you''re talking about and it
  will go and do it. So I''ve got a project now called Pete''s Brain.'
- 'Them: Going to be a good.'
- 'Me: And it''s basically everything that I know about clients. And about marketing
  and what I''ve done with them, what we''re going to be proposed to do in the future.
  It is pretty mind blowing. As this guy says, it''s a great time to be alive. If
  you want to embrace it. If you don''t, it''s horrible to be live.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I would suggest everybody in the business has to embrace AI.'
- 'Them: That''s when the doctor waits. Yeah, absolutely. It could be really helpful
  and just, like, writing down everything in general. There''s so much going on at
  the moment. So it''s like if you don''t write something down, you''re just kind
  of forget.'
- 'Me: Correct. And I can talk to you and concentrate, and I don''t have to worry
  about taking notes. And I also don''t have to worry about. Oh, I said I''d do that,
  and I''ve not done it. That''s the stage I want to be getting to. So there''s nothing
  falls through the get through the cracks.'
- 'Them: Ting. Yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s the plan. That''s the plan.'
- 'Them: So just a few things. With the budgets at the moment. It''s good that you''ve
  joined the Que, Alex as well. So just go through everything. So I''ve reduced the
  budget. I reduced them on Friday a lot.'
- 'Me: Yeah, so that nice one.'
- 'Them: And then I''ve reduced them again yesterday and now we''re under spending,
  so I added a little bit more spend back on to that UK brand exact and the US brand
  exact. But apart from that, I''m going to probably just leave everything else and
  then we''ll probably come in just under 14 114k.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: If that''s okay, Alex as well. So that''s budget wise. And then in terms
  of Christmas rollout, so we''ve received all of the assets. I will share my screen.
  So because I''ve tried to split them out. So basically, we''ve had, like, one whole
  set of assets. Images and videos, and that''s all we''re getting for Christmas.
  So we have to split them into two so we don''t get, like, creative fatigue. We''ll
  have at first Christmas rollout from next week, and then from the 17th, we''re going
  to be rolling out Black Friday stuff. So everything that''s Christmas related will
  pause. And then after the two week of Black Friday, which is 17 November to 1 December,
  That''s Black Friday. And then after that, we''re going back to Christmas Phase
  two.'
- 'Me: So that''s all the creative for Christmas.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So show you in here. So they''ve given us, like, the free PMAX sizes
  and. Yeah. So this is everything. Some of these we can''t go live in because they''re
  for spring. Someone.'
- 'Me: All right. Ok. That''s what I was worried about. Nice.'
- 'Them: I don''t know if I''m saying the financial year right. But, yeah, next year.
  So things like petrol can''t go live yet. And then autumn briefcase, for example.
  And also this wine tote that can only go live in phase two of Christmas if we have
  the stock. But I''ve just read segment out everything else into, like, different
  product categories because I know people were talking. About letting out our pmax
  into different product groups? I don''t know.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: If because of how many assets we have, I don''t think we can really split
  into different campaigns. I don''t think we have enough. But different asset groups
  could be a possibility.'
- 'Me: That''s what I was thinking. Rather than campaign.'
- 'Them: Yeah, we know for certain. Yeah, that''s fine. And then videos. We only have
  four videos, so we have a games video back gammon, I believe. And then diaries.
  I was hoping that I could try and repurpose this for notebooks as well, but when
  I looked at the video, it literally opens up and shows you the diary. By week, so
  you can''t really do that.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: And then we have the lever accessories, so cooling and a multi zip curse
  or case. And then you can also use up like those accessories and women''s accessories.
  So. Come back here. These are the videos we have, and we have them in, like, 18
  seconds or 10 seconds. And then we also signal the fact that they''re under metal.
  It''s just to avoid duplicates for the team. And then we also have them. In landscape
  as well. And then there''s going to be like a master video, which is more like a
  film that''s still in progress. But we will get back soon, so we''ll probably have
  like three, maybe three videos per asset group. But the problem is that with some
  product groups that were having there''s not going to be any video because it''s
  not relevant.'
- 'Me: Did I. Did I show that with you?'
- 'Them: And I don''t think we can do that.'
- 'Me: Suggest you want. We added Christmas one on, didn''t it?'
- 'Them: I don''t think so, but I think it''s maybe something that we both suggested
  or talked about last week. So what did I say?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, I''d actually created some. No, I''ve not created them. I''ve got
  some suggestions for what they should be to start off with.'
- 'Them: I''ll leave you to it. But I''m going to redo the championship.'
- 'Me: I didn''t know whether I sent that over to you. If I''ve not, then I will do.'
- 'Them: Ok? Yeah. Sounds good.'
- 'Me: Straight after the first one is Christmas gifts. Because then we''re going
  to do a vmax campaign just for Christmas.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Kids can I suggest and I don''t know enough about onenote to know whether we
  can do this? There is Asset Studio within the account. Can we upload these into
  the Asset Studio so we can pull them in directly from there into the respective
  PMAX campaigns?'
- 'Them: Not sure how quick. Yeah, like, I think I know even there''s, like. Think
  I know what you mean, because that''s sometimes what I''ll do. I''ll just, like,
  upload everything at once and then.'
- 'Me: If. You go into tools that I decide, and then Asset Studios right at the very
  top. And then if we''re clever the way we actually do the create the folders. Now,
  if you go to tools. On the left. That''s it.'
- 'Them: I can take action from the office.'
- 'Me: And then no tools. Out. There.'
- 'Them: Ok?'
- 'Me: So if we can create a Christmas. So if you go to Asset Library, there.'
- 'Them: Yeah, you can, like, upload everything and then it shows up in PMAX for you,
  yeah?'
- 'Me: We create new there and do Christmas 2025. And then for all those breakdowns
  that you''ve got, if you can create the folders for those. So that I''ll know straight
  away which ones they relate to.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. That''s fine. So I know you said you''re going to think they were
  like a list. So we. Do you want to, like, scrap these groups or, like, maybe, like,
  find how they would, like, merge together based on your list of my list?'
- 'Me: I''m annoyed I''ve not sent that over to you.'
- 'Them: I''ve also shared this with you. I can share the link as well. But I don''t
  know enough about my. I''ll put it in the other chat just so there''s not like multiple
  paid search catch ups. Think about it. Seems like effective. Second week of the
  night. Can you see it? They''ve got.'
- 'Me: I''m gonna have to send this up to. I can''t find out where it is.'
- 'Them: No worries. That''s fine.'
- 'Me: But if you could take that on board as to what they''re going to look like
  and then maybe use that structure for the folder. It''s just that transmission of
  information. I don''t know the product particularly well.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it would be good to add your business knowledge to that, to be able to
  tell me what exactly they are and whether I can add them or not. And I think it
  might be useful having a sense check afterwards.'
- 'Them: Because it''s got. Great.'
- 'Me: Just scanning through, just making sure the right images are in the right video.'
- 'Them: Sending off today.'
- 'Me: And preserve the brand somewhat, don''t we?'
- 'Them: Yeah, I spoke to. Yeah. Because that''s what I had to, like, just split them
  into our product categories, but also how they. And then I''ve just. Yeah. Tried
  to look into phase one and phase two by a couple color coding.'
- 'Me: Somewhat. No, we''ve got to preserve the brand.'
- 'Them: So yeah, anything yellow is phase one, and I think in blue will be phase
  two and then anything. That''s why it will be for both. We only have like one card
  image, so I''m. I''ve put that into gifts for him and guess for her.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: And then I think once I''ve looked at your list, Peter, and kind of merged
  it with mine, and I guess brand product groups, we can look at, like,'
- 'Me: Just ping that over now.'
- 'Them: Sorry.'
- 'Me: I''ve just pinged that over to you now. I put it in the chat.'
- 'Them: Thank you. Yeah. So, christmas gifts. Notebooks. Yeah, that''s fine, but.
  No, but we''ve got to go and check. Travel accessories will kind of fall under lever
  accessories, and then I think maybe we should have a separate asset because it''s
  a bag. So, yeah, it''s a level. Accessories. Travel accessories. I think we should
  combine the travel accessories and card holders roster small leather goods. Oh,
  ready to go.'
- 'Me: The only thing with that is that the intent on the travel accessories is it''s
  a travel. It''s for people who are traveling.'
- 'Them: And then. There. Actually, I''m just going to pocket any five.'
- 'Me: That was the thought behind that. The card holders and small libraries. I''m
  just thinking of audiences that we''re actually going to be targeting with that
  and search themes. Because if we do the travel accessories, we can do gifts for
  travelers.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: And it''ll just pop up, that one collection. It''s going to take some playing
  around, doing listing groups, I think, for these, just making sure we''re getting
  the right things.'
- 'Them: We do have a travel edit. It was like a solid page for that. I like the automatic.'
- 'Me: Was it?'
- 'Them: Like taking it down. Oh, there it is.'
- 'Me: Is that not it on that list of sent over?'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah.'
- 'Me: It could be URL on there.'
- 'Them: There was some kind of report. Right. Yeah. So we''ve got travel bags. Okay?
  So in terms of creatives, Let me put it here. So, I mean, from the Maybe only like,
  three.'
- 'Me: You don''t necessarily need to change the mail or on it, just the folder structure
  that we''re using.'
- 'Them: Yeah, sorry. I''ve just, like, put it like this just to kind of, like, make
  it easy for me to, like, visualize where a print is going. And then I''ll, like,
  kind of, like, replicate this into Google Ads with the folders.'
- 'Me: Okay? Wonderful.'
- 'Them: Cool. To. And then we''ve got stationary. We don''t have any, like, writing
  and paper stationary creatives.'
- 'Me: We can always wake them up from the products themselves.'
- 'Them: Do you mean, like? Sorry. Could you elaborate on what you mean?'
- 'Me: I could just pull in some images from the actual product catalog. S.'
- 'Them: I don''t know if we''re allowed to do that. I think everything has to be
  like.'
- 'Me: It''s your images.'
- 'Them: Visually, like, has to come from these images. If you got. I mean, like.
  I don''t know if you mean, like, generating images.'
- 'Me: No, not generated, no. Just taking them out of the. Out of the catalog. If
  we had a group for travel, then it will just look. I''ll just go and look at the
  travel products and pick some of the images from there.'
- 'Them: I was in, like, the website images.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay? I''ll ask Mark Tin if we can do that.'
- 'Me: They are their images. It''s not as though we''re creating a display ad or
  anything for these.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I know. You mean. It''s just, I think, visually, like, they want to
  push, like, one message, which is like this Christmas hero campaign.'
- 'Me: They are just what.'
- 'Them: So, like, everything would need to be, like, consistent. So I. I would just
  need to check with them if they''d, like, be okay with us machine.'
- 'Me: Full on display type campaign for this, what we''re building. What I have in
  mind, what we''re building with these PMAX groups is that we''re actually building
  something for the future, that these will run all the time because we''re going
  to get a higher rise out of these, we break them down. A bit further. So there is
  a longevity to them. This isn''t a Christmas campaign I was proposing, this was
  a PMAX campaign that''s going to have notebooks, travel accessories, card holders
  and so on, and the Christmas messaging around it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Is not, as you know, it''s not full on in your face. This is people looking
  for notebooks. So if you think where these images are actually going to appear,
  they''re going to appear as very small images next to the potentially next to the
  text assets in a search ad. Like quite small. And the other places they appear,
  they might appear in the display ad somewhere, but the actual spend on display is
  very small. If we''re actually talking about doing Demand Gen or a video campaign
  or something like that, then yes, I''d say yes, let''s do just do a Christmassy
  type assets all over the place. But these are very specific searches of a very specific
  products. And so hence the fact using the Creative from the product page itself
  would be more appropriate than actually using Christmas Creative.'
- 'Them: I get what you mean. I think that should be okay. Yeah, I think that should
  be fine. Alex, do you think that will be okay? Like she''s in the product page.
  Finding the context of what Peter''s explained. Yeah. Cool.'
- 'Me: Don''t tell marketing. You''ll have to explain the context all over again.
  It is important. It is important to know where they''re going and how they''re going
  to be displayed.'
- 'Them: That''s fine. And then we thought, well, it''s in purses again. I can guess.
  In those images would come from the product page.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: See these Christmas images will be great for the actual Christmas campaign
  where we''re doing leather bags for Christmas or Christmas gifts for him, Christmas
  gifts for her.'
- 'Them: Desk accessories.'
- 'Me: They will be perfect. Because that''s going to resonate then, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. I think all of these images can also go in the gifting campaign as
  well as, like, going in, like, our, I guess, our separate. Emacs asset groups as
  well. Yeah, we can, like, mix them up. Yeah. Pick accessories. Yeah, that''s fine.
  Accessories. Cool. And then panama. Well, it doesn''t look like that. You''re all
  works.'
- 'Me: That''s the Panama one, is it?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: They''re not taking it down. If you open the file, how do you book?'
- 'Me: So that''s going to be a search then, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: It together because my own.'
- 'Me: If we do it as a search URL rather than a specific page. It''s nice.'
- 'Them: Do you think we''ll be okay from, like, a landing page experience? Point
  of view.'
- 'Me: What people are looking for.'
- 'Them: To land on a search. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It says, your search results for Panama. They''re looking for Panama leather
  products, and there they are. If you were talking about SEO, I wouldn''t necessarily
  say that was a great landing page for Panama, but from a page search perspective.
  Perspective where someone''s very direct on what they''re looking for, especially
  with something like that, I think that''s fine.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: I''d question what sort of traffic winner get on that. But it''s worth doing.
  Yeah.'
- 'Them: Groups with clins. Yeah. Okay, cool. So what I''ll do after this call, I''ll
  pull up with, like, the full list, what we''re going to be pushing, and then after
  that, we need the ad copy for it.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So if you want, we can exploit it into two and. Yeah, divide and conquer.'
- 'Me: I''m more than happy to do that PMAX campaign for all of those asset groups.
  I''m okay with that. I would suggest that. If I create those. If you don''t mind.
  If I create those, I''ll create some assets for them. I''ll pause the asset groups
  within there, and I''ll tell you when they''re done. And then you can look at them
  then. And I''ll also try and produce something, a document that actually shows the
  assets text so that you can show through to marketing.'
- 'Them: Yes, please. That would. Yeah, be cool. Yeah, that''s fine.'
- 'Me: Is that okay? Okay? We don''t want to annoy them, do we? You know, that''s
  worked really well last time. It''s made things a lot quicker. But if we can be
  pushing rather than waiting them for them to produce it, then at least we can dictate
  which asset groups we want to do.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, that''s fine.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So you''ll create the asset groups and there will be a mix of the product
  page images and the Christmas assets.'
- 'Me: Yeah, that''s the thing.'
- 'Them: I''ll see. Okay. I''ll see if I can get you access to our. But, you know,
  I would just. Would it help if I just do the folders in Google this asset library?'
- 'Me: It would be great if you could. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, okay, I''ll do that today.'
- 'Me: It would be great. And it will need those for the US as well as the uk. Unfortunately,
  we can''t share the asset studio between.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The.'
- 'Them: I''ll do them across all regions because we''ll probably have them in, like,
  EU and Rest world, maybe. Actually, I don''t think you can have logos on image extensions.
  No, you can''t. We do have some images without logos, but they''re. For meta. I''ll
  ask if we can use those for image extensions, but for now I''ll just add the asset
  library folders in the UK and us. Cool.'
- 'Me: This. Is, we''re going to smash this.'
- 'Them: So. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I think the whole thing about the budgets and projections, which I''ve done,'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: The one saving grace is that one saving goes the opportunities the rest of
  the world. You know, last year there wasn''t anything running on rest of world.
  And this year there is, and it does produce quite a decent roas, and it''s at the
  right times. So I think whilst I apologize for projection, it is very specific,
  especially the 8:00, 5:00. I was asked it to be specific in that, giving it that
  context, but I think there''s flexibility to move budget around if we feel as though
  we''re getting a better roas.'
- 'Them: Rry. Yeah, I had a look yesterday.'
- 'Me: Say, you know, say we take 100 quid out of the UK and 100 quid out of the US,
  because I''m sticking to the rest of the world for the day, onto the daily budget,
  just because it''s doing well. That will give us, possibly give us a better rate
  of return. But we''re just going to have to keep on top of it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I think it''ll make more sense as we go and go through it and. Yeah.
  I was gonna come on to that in a minute. And, yeah, if you want to go through the
  budget projections again, add a look yesterday.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: With the pain. Sorry. Launching on the PMAX campaign. So are we gonna have,
  like, one Peanuts Company with all the separate asset routes with different products?
  And then a separate gifting campaign, or is it just gonna be one campaign?'
- 'Me: I would suggest so and then so for the pma.'
- 'Them: Sorry. The letter.'
- 'Me: I was going to say, if we do the PMAX Christmas and do themes and so on based
  around Christmas, totally round Christmas.'
- 'Them: Yep.'
- 'Me: I actually don''t see that doing as much volume as the standard pmax. It''s
  for one, it''ll be new, and number two, we will be aiming it directly at Christmas
  gifts. When you think of what you search for at Christmas. If you wanted a gift
  for someone, you don''t go? I don''t know. Christmas gift for my Auntie Gertrude.
  You would have thought about it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. You just look for the product. Yeah.'
- 'Me: At least let''s hope that there''s some thought has gone into gifting at Christmas
  and that you don''t just leave it to chance like that.'
- 'Them: People.'
- 'Me: So we will potentially be spending. Well, I think we will be spending more
  money on those generic PMAXes.'
- 'Them: Yeah, people might put, like, purse gift or. Ag gift, maybe like the product
  plus gift.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, you know, VRP Max Group, I''ll pay my current PMAX campaigns. Those are
  just going to be replaced with or like, revamped, essentially.'
- 'Me: Well, we''ll keep the asset group as the main asset group for the pma, Yeah.'
- 'Them: Here are sidekick. Here. Inside kick asset group. Okay? And then we''ll just
  create new ones.'
- 'Me: Yes. And we''ll look at volumes as to whether we remove the segmentation for
  here as a psychics, or we keep it in.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah.'
- 'Me: For those particular products. It depends what sort of volume we produce. There''s
  going to be a certain amount of socket and C really with this, as to.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: What''s working, what isn''t working? We found that they''re not producing
  the volume that we want. Then there''s nothing wrong with actually taking the segmentation
  off. I''ve not looked at the segmentation recently in Products Hero, so I don''t
  know where it sits. I don''t know. How many products we''ve got in each of the individual
  segmentations, so I do need to check that out. Excuse me just for one minute, please.
  Just want.'
- 'Them: Alex, our first call. Do you want to go to paid Social Creatives? And like
  the ads for that. Yeah, I think I might be for it. One I make myself free at one.'
- 'Me: To.'
- 'Them: Let me just have a quick look.'
- 'Me: Please.'
- 'Them: Two. I''ve got seb. Let''s do one, then. That''s fine. Yeah, I could. I need
  one, but. Or I can do after seb. That''s better. Yeah, that''s fine. Yeah. Is three
  okay? Yeah, three is fine.'
- 'Me: Sorry.'
- 'Them: No worries.'
- 'Me: When the every email comes in, when it says when you''re going to get a delivery,
  should you say when you''re in a meeting?'
- 'Them: It always happens. Or I get my doctor''s course right in the middle of the
  meeting.'
- 'Me: Sorry. Carry on.'
- 'Them: It''s always bad timing. No worries. So the new pmax product in the state
  robes, they''re going to also have hero inside segmentation. They''re not just going
  to be all purses, for example.'
- 'Me: Now we''ll have. I''ll have a look at it. I''ll see how it''s going to. How
  it''s going to segment out. We need a decent number of products in each section
  to be able, working.'
- 'Them: Ok?'
- 'Me: So if it means. Yeah, it''s. It''s going to depend upon the number of products
  per asset group, really. You know, we might just say, well, there''s only going
  to be five products in there. Let''s just do all of them rather than here as a sidekicks.
  I''m not saying we would have five products in an asset group, but let''s look at
  the sizings of the listing groups and make the decision based upon that, because
  I''m sure there''s some products that trigger off at Christmas and the rest of the
  year. Certainly I think we need to be doing a pmax. Well, you''ve done the PMAX
  Diaries, haven''t you?'
- 'Them: Ay. We have asset. We have asset groups for diaries in each here inside campaign.'
- 'Me: Cool. Right. Ok. So there''s also potential to take those out and stick them
  in their own campaign. So we can pile some budget into that. That''s probably not
  a bad idea.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Because there''s search campaign. Such companies are already been doing
  really well, especially like in the uk.'
- 'Me: Was that worth doing? Then let''s take in the taking diaries out.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Creating a new PMAX campaign now, which is just for diaries.'
- 'Them: Eating. Would it be worth it?'
- 'Me: I''m suggesting that would. That probably would be worth it.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''s definitely worth testing. Like, it''s done well for my search
  perspective, so it would probably do really well and P Max as well.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah. Well, that PMAX hns, that''s, that''s running at the moment. That''s
  got. So that''s got dari''s aw25, which you''ve created. To create. To create a
  new PMAX campaign for diaries will be relatively straightforward, wouldn''t it?
  Because we can just use that asset group.'
- 'Them: Yeah, you could just copy it over and it''ll be.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Do you want me to do that?'
- 'Them: I think it''ll be. If you''ve got time. I''m also. I don''t mind doing it.'
- 'Me: Well, while I''m doing the asset groups anyway, I''ll take that out and stick
  it into a new PMAX campaign.'
- 'Them: Okay? That also has. Yeah. Horizon Sidekick segmentation from Product Hero.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Thinking about it. From. Yeah, it''s actually got old, Iris. It''s not
  segmented. It''s not segmented on H and S, that asset group. Which is fine. I think
  that''s a good idea. I don''t think there''s any point in having HNS on there, because
  the heroes and psychics is looking back over a period of time. This is diaries.
  They''re only just starting now. So let''s not restrict the products that are actually.
  Being shown. So I''ll just replicate the asset group in a new PMAX campaign. I''ll
  apportion the budget dependent upon what it''s been spending over the last couple
  of weeks.'
- 'Them: I love story. What happened to the segmentation I did in product hair experiment
  when we went through it and we were looking and in product here at how to create
  like, A segmentation for diaries.'
- 'Me: Job me to share my screen? I''m actually looking at it right now.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: So this is the hs diaries. Aw25.'
- 'Them: Trying to get involved with everything.'
- 'Me: So it''s not segmenting them at all. We''ve got 253 in there. That''s fine.
  I think that''s it''s learnt already. It''s got history on those products. We might
  find for a couple of days. The PMAPS campaign might bomb, but there''s sufficient
  traffic on there. Let''s have a look. 30 days. Yeah, we got 50 conversions in 30
  days, and no doubt that''s gone like that recently. Probably best to do that. And
  then we''ve got. The others in there, which are on H and S. So, yeah, I''ll just
  add new asset groups into there and move that other one out.'
- 'Them: So you know how I created that segmentation in Product Hero? Where would
  I find that? Enlisting groups. Because you know how to, like, create it, like, level
  things, like product level free.'
- 'Me: It''s on the custom label. Thread.'
- 'Them: Okay? But, like, if it''s like a Diary Heroes Inside Kick segmentation that
  I''ve created in Product Hero, would that, like. And it''s, like, named diaries.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Is that not meant to like?'
- 'Me: It doesn''t look at the name. The actual segmentation is done in priority.
  So it would say, do diaries first. Look for heroes and psychics and diaries based
  upon what criteria you''ve set. And then at the end, there''s a catch all that.
  If nothing has been set for custom label 3, use this criteria for these heroes and
  sidekicks, so it would filter through that way. So your heroes and psychics for
  diaries might be 200% target ROAS, but then your catch all one at the bottom might
  be 300%, but it''ll only use that one if it''s not already been set prior to that
  point. So in your asset groups for the diaries, If you wanted to break this down
  further using heroes and sidekicks, you''d use Custom Label 3.'
- 'Them: Do it from there.'
- 'Me: And there you can see the way in which the diaries are set up. So these are
  specific to diaries now, because of that hierarchical structure that you''ve got
  for this listing group that''s saying how many heroes and psychics diaries you have.'
- 'Them: Okay? So then that would show. So that hero''s group under diaries. Would
  split it out. The content criteria that I set in Product Hero.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Them: Cool. So, yeah, that''s all for Christmas. And then I. I noticed you put
  in the ad copy for the brand stationery. I saw that. So I know into, like, improved
  the ad copy for the other campaigns. I can work on that. I''ll start with like UK
  and then move on to us. When? Book some time. And then I''m still working on negative
  SQLs as well. I''ve just been trying to sort out this incremental revenue. Today.
  And then.'
- 'Me: I appreciate you doing that, Lauren.'
- 'Them: Final thing is. Yeah. Your budget recommendations.'
- 'Me: Okay, let me share this.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: We''ve got super complicated. It got super complicated because we were saying,
  with double counting on the UK for the purchase conversion action, the same was
  true for the US as well.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Which was also stopped back in April. So doing year on year comparisons have
  had to use the purchase conversion action to work out where there''s been increases
  in conversion rate. So the first thing this is just to reiterate the budgets that
  have been agreed. So that''s the total budget for November and the total budget
  for December. And what percentage of the budget each one of these the regions actually
  are going to use. So I''ve looked at an average here to find out what these percentages
  are. So again, just, it''s just going to be indicative, but at least we can track
  the budgets per geographical location.'
- 'Them: Is this? Is budget open to, like being fluid, like, for example.'
- 'Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: If okay.'
- 'Me: Yeah, and that''s what I mean. This really isn''t me to be this precise, but
  I know the business needs this information to start off with, and just so long as
  just along the dot line at the bottom is correct.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, I don''t, I don''t think an extra 1 or 2% for each of these locations
  is going to make much difference to in the grand scheme of things, especially if
  we decide that we''ve got 5.7% for the rest of the world. If that went up to 8%,
  because we''re going to get a higher roas, then it would be more of a pat on the
  back rather than why didn''t you hit 5.7%? Okay, so this was the. Just out of interest,
  the conversion rate analysis for the US and the uk. For last year. Quite interesting.
  How. The US is lower. I mean, it''s a lower point anyway because of the fact it''s
  a UK company is shipping out to the us. But also, it wasn''t as severe between October
  and November, the actual increase, and that''s reflected really in the way we can
  play around with the roas. So. That''s just a reflection of the difference between
  the two of them. So then looking at the conversion rates over the months. So this
  is just an explainer of the way in which I''ve worked out what the increases should
  be and when to spend the money, when to drop the target rise. So this is the story
  behind it. So the UK went from 4.54% to 5.74% in November, 5.95 in December. OK,
  so Pete was December. So we''re seeing an uplift. Of q4 to q3 to q4. Of 31% last
  year for UK and 22% for the US. So that''s the justification of playing around with
  budgets, playing around with target roas, because the indicators are that the conversion
  rate is going to go up in November and December and we''re going to make some more
  money. Now you could say at the end of the day, and excuse my French. No, Sherlock,
  we''re going to do better at Christmas. But at least it gives it a number to look
  at. And that increase has been used to work out when to drop the target. Roas. Ok,
  so you can see rest of the world. It''s rubbish. That starts, it''s not really telling
  us anything. But as I say, this is potentially an opportunity for us to try and
  get more out of rest of the world over the Christmas period, because there was Nothing
  back in December2024. For rest of world. Maybe it could have been last shipping
  dates. We''re going to take that into consideration as well the rest of the world.
  I don''t know when the cut off is likely to be for shipping and also for Europe.
  We will have to take that into consideration as to what we do with the budgets around
  about that time. Because if people aren''t going to Christmas, I would suggest we
  drop the budgets. Around about that time. And increase the target roas.'
- 'Them: I think the management finance.'
- 'Me: That was a sage nod to that was Alex. This is a wise old.'
- 'Them: Yeah, we''ve got those. All those dates. Are pretty much confirmed because
  they won''t have changed much of last year.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But a bit a day or two difference.'
- 'Me: If you could ping them over, mate, that''d be great. It was in the G sheet
  or whatever that. I can plug those into this.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. We''ll do.'
- 'Me: Ok, so again, these are just explainers. On where the conversion rates are
  going to go. The key findings and then we''ve got the implementation timetable here.
  As to what we''re going to do with the row, I think it was a better description
  further on. Where the heck is it? So I''ve not looked at this since a few days ago.
  We''ve got all the guardrails here as to. As to where we expect things to be at
  certain times as well. So we can see how it''s actually what the trajectory of the
  strategy is going to be. There was a target, Roas.'
- 'Them: That.'
- 'Me: Explainer.'
- 'Them: Which. Is a bit about the weekly pallet date and weekly monitoring and validation
  protocol. It''s just.'
- 'Me: Here we go. Here we go. So 29th to the 14th, we''ve got a 15% ROAS reduction.
  So that''s from tomorrow. Yeah, it''s from tomorrow. 15% for the UK. And that''s
  the projected spend over the period.'
- 'Them: Very.'
- 'Me: Us just days. It is 10% reduction for Europe and standard for the rest of the
  world. Then from the 15th to the 30th. I''m saying Thanksgiving scaling. It''s also
  Black Friday scaling as well.'
- 'Them: Good.'
- 'Me: We''re maintaining that 15% for the UK. Dropping the US by 10%. Maintaining
  the European one and reducing rest of world by 10%. So then, versus the 15th of
  December, when we''re on peak, we will be at 15% reduction. For most of them, apart
  from rest of world, which will be 10%. It''s 10% because it was insufficient data,
  really, for the rest of the world to warrant it going any further than that. But
  we could potentially drop that further. And then carrying on with the reductions
  over all the way up to the 31st. We go into sales straight after Christmas.'
- 'Them: Thankful. Ly. I feel like you can find 24th, it''ll be better.'
- 'Me: Right. So that will reduction will stay there.'
- 'Them: On.'
- 'Me: Until we get back into some level of normality. And before that point, I can
  work out what to do with the ROAS target then anyway, based upon the performance
  that there''s been. So I think what I''ll do is I will. I''m going to rejig this
  because to me, it makes sense. There''s been a progression of this. I think the
  actual ROAS reductions and the budgeting is sound, but it''s just a little bit unreadable.
  So what I''ll do is I''ll get it to consolidate this. As to the action plan for
  when to reduce roas, what budget to expect for each week, because no point in doing
  daily, we just do it per week so we can actually see how that''s moving. And then
  we can compare the projected against what you have in your budget planner.'
- 'Them: The waiver.'
- 'Me: What it''s telling you what your trajectory of your budget is.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it''ll just make it a little bit more track. I''ll simplify it.'
- 'Them: Yes, please.'
- 'Me: So that we could all understand. I think I was very mindful of the fact. I
  wanted to justify it. I didn''t trust it. So when it says about the percentages,
  all the way along, I''ve gone through and checked them all just to make sure it''s
  right, just to make sure they were. Actually those conversion rate reductions, because
  we don''t want to be making these reductions when the conversion rate actually went
  up that week. So the key points really are from tomorrow to the 15th, the 15th to
  the 30th versus the 15th, and the 16th to the 31st. Those are our key periods. And
  the things that we''re going to be discussing going forward as to whether we''re
  actually hitting those points or not. Now, if we do hit those points, those were
  the revenue figures. Of where we expect to be on those budgets. So we''re on a total
  Q4 revenue of 1.6. Yes. So that will include October as well. So revenue 819 for
  December and 8, 25 for November. Do you have it broken down to that level, Alex,
  or not?'
- 'Them: I''ve got the revenue target. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Country. And month, probably
  down to.'
- 'Me: And how are we with that? Does that. Does that match up with your expectations?'
- 'Them: Wait. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: Ok, cool. That''s the right answer. Good. Right. Which is great, because if
  you think the basis of this I''ve plugged in a budget. I plugged in an expectation
  and conversion rate and an expectation of revenue. What I did do is say, this is
  where we want to be and how are we going to do it? So it''s actually come out from
  a different angle. So I''m pleased with that. Good. Nice one. Don''t worry about
  these here. Then, Lauren at 4pM. That''s what we''re going to do.'
- 'Them: I can just look at the financial projections bit and then 15 rows reduction
  is that of course like all campaigned.'
- 'Me: So we say again.'
- 'Them: You''ve mentioned about like making a 15 rows reduction tomorrow. And so
  it''s that, like. Across all campaigns, okay?'
- 'Me: Across. The board. Yeah.'
- 'Them: I''m not. And then usa says standard roas. So do you mean to, like, keep
  it as it is?'
- 'Me: Well, whatever the ROAS target is at the moment, we''re just going to take
  15% off it.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: But I say I''ll clarify that in this if this isn''t going to break it down
  by campaign, because the campaign''s last year were completely different to this
  year. So we have to do it across the board and actually do some juggling that if
  one campaign is struggling and it''s bringing a whole lot down, then we shift it
  back again.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So whilst this is literally just a framework going back to what you said before,
  this really isn''t set in stone. This is just where we would like to be. But that''s
  our skill in managing it. And making sure we actually are actually hitting those
  targets.'
- 'Them: Just looking for the. Sheet that Alex gave us last week with the projects.
  And like new shifted budgets. Give me a second. Scenario, or it''ll be in the Digital
  Marketing Master.'
- 'Me: It was. On. Just. I think when I pulled it from now, because I know it was
  in the chat as well, wasn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Oh, there we go.'
- 'Them: Cool. I''m just trying to look at like what all went on the self aware. Yeah,
  I''ve got the additional sprints. I''m just looking at what are.'
- 'Me: Have you got it? Ok?'
- 'Them: Threshold. So. 70.'
- 'Me: Can be really confusing.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: That they''re not actually calendar months. Are they specific?'
- 'Them: Alex, am I correct in thinking about all Google adware should still be 6.02.
  That''s still the target. I''m just looking in the digital marketing master in the
  paid search tab. Be better for that. It''d be probably better off looking in the
  additional spend. Shit. Okay? That''s the latest view in there. So that has the
  new budget sitting there. Yeah. As your totals as well I should have. Cool. The
  bit where it says paid search, seasonal uplift, and it''s got, like, the revenue.
  Is that just for. That''s just for the additional. Right. Where are you looking?
  Sorry. So you''ve got Roys 7 to or 6 to 12 by month. And you''ve got total additional
  spend in budget plus additional. Yeah. So you''ve got that bit and the kind of,
  like, box next to it where it says you''ve got, like, spend revenue and then roas.
  So we''re just looking at that bit because the new, like, box you''ve done from,
  I guess, like Colin''s and R, it has the budget but not necessarily the revenue
  target. Because I''m just trying to figure out, like, what row. What''s like. The
  standard, Ross, that we should be at at the moment. Well, yeah. So this has only
  got so to do that we have to add so that box you''re looking at has any goal. What
  the additional spend needs to drive. Yeah. As in what the. Sorry, what the. The
  additional overall spend is so like the bits that say like 114k the budget in a
  plus additional space. So from m6 to. Yeah, r12. That''s just budget, right? Yeah.
  I''m going to see if I''ve got another sheet which will show this clearer.'
- 'Me: Now, the average roas in, for instance, in the. For the uk. In q4 roas 2024
  for the uk was 8.88. So we should smash those grass targets.'
- 'Them: You can use the paid search tab in the digital marketing sheet, but it just
  needs checking that they spend adds up. So for October, they''re the same. They''re
  both 140. I''ll add in the November. Onward spends. Okay, and then that changes.
  So I can look at row row eight, right? As what our target for Google Ads is. Yeah,
  providing. All of those spend numbers. Reflect the latest bend of having want to
  produce that table. I''ve just updated them so order spends under total budget reflect
  what''s in your additional spend. Scenario, the ones that you put in on Friday.
  Yeah. Yeah. So for my revenue point of view, it''s the budget tracker numbers. Plus
  the additional budget number, additional revenue target, and then the spend is just
  the original Splend plus the additional spend. And that should add up on that sheet.
  Okay? I''ve only updated the spend for the section in like Navy. So I''ll just.
  I''ll just focus on that.'
- 'Me: I''m really sorry, guys. I''m going to jump off in a couple of minutes.'
- 'Them: No, that''s. Everything can tend to 12. Hasn''t changed. It''s just the additional
  has changed, hasn''t it? Yeah. So it''s just making sure those additional numbers.
  Are what they are. In the new version. And if they are, then that should add up
  to the totals. Just going to update the shoulders. Normally. I think the original
  spend. Where your cursor is right now. Ok. No, that''s fine. Ok? It''s just loads
  of wealthy people that big. Mentor health institution. But just so we can probably
  do this budget stuff offline if needed. But are there any other bits we need to
  run through? No, I think we''re ok.'
- 'Me: I''ll simplify those numbers for you in the action plan. But I mean the principles
  there. The plan should work. Famous last words. And I am recording this. Ok, we
  said anything else, just give us a shout.'
- 'Them: Well do. Thanks, peter.'
- 'Me: Ok? I''ll get that over to you today.'
- 'Them: Ok, thank you.'
- 'Me: All right. Cheers, guys.'
- 'Them: Js thank you.'

- Me: So you're going to allocate them automatically to. What's the fail safe on this? Can you email me a summary every week? Of what meeting notes have been put against what customers. Hello.
- Them: Great. I just wanted to heaven my headphones, otherwise the whole office would have been able to hear you.
- Me: I'm not quite either, am I?
- Them: No, you're actually very quiet. But I was like, just in case.
- Me: Well, I've just bought. An AI dictation services. I've told you before, it's called whisper flow. And I don't type a lot now. I actually just talk it through.
- Them: Notes, everything.
- Me: It does voice the text, but in any text box you could possibly think of, even, like, a URL bar, it'll do it. And I'm very conscious that. Hi, Alex. I'm very conscious that I want to make it as clear as possible when I'm doing it, so I actually bought a boom. Mic, which is literally just here.
- Them: I've got a. Alex. Anything else.
- Me: So I'm sat with this right under my nose all day, every day with a keyboard in front of me. So my wife says I look like a DJ or something. He's only the microphone that makes me look like a dj. Make that clear.
- Them: So. On your paid search decks.
- Me: Yes, that's right.
- Them: Just pressing button. No, it's probably, like, really useful. It probably saves a lot of time. I need to find something like that because I know like Google reps or other media owners, they tend to use that.
- Me: Yeah. It's massive, Lauren. It's absolutely massive. I had a meeting this morning at quarter past five. It was with someone in Australia, an AI course that I'm doing. And his courses are okay, but he does tell you stuff like that. It's like at the moment I'm recording this with. I need to say that now. Don't I like the Google reps, do I? You don't mind if I record this meeting, do you? But I've literally just written a little script. At the end of this meeting, it will take that and drop it into the Smyson folder so that I can refer to this in the future.
- Them: One.
- Me: Or the AI will refer to it in the future. Said, are there any action plans that you have at the moment? And it'll go. Look at all my clients say, well, yeah, we said you were going to do this, we're going to do that, follow this up.
- Them: To use the Frontier sales to.
- Me: Absolutely incredible. Behind this screen now got on teams. It's got three processes running which are creating AI procedures. Stuff like that. It looks at all the emails. It'll take the emails details into against the client. So I'm not missing anything at all.
- Them: Stop tv. It's something you pay for. This is all.
- Me: But it's basically when you get up past five. Whisper flow is $10 a month. No, it's not. For the amount it saves, you say 135 words per minute. I can talk and it will do it. It will keep up with that. I think. Well, Claude, I'm paying 80 pound a month for which is worth every single penny. It's like having half a dozen VAs working for you. And I use cursor, which it's for doing code. So. Which sounds really techy, but you just say, I want to be able to do this. This is a repetitive task that I do every month. I have to create this spreadsheet based upon last month's data. Can you go and do it for me? And it's a repetitive thing, but every time you refer to that in the future, it will know what you're talking about and it will go and do it. So I've got a project now called Pete's Brain.
- Them: Going to be a good.
- Me: And it's basically everything that I know about clients. And about marketing and what I've done with them, what we're going to be proposed to do in the future. It is pretty mind blowing. As this guy says, it's a great time to be alive. If you want to embrace it. If you don't, it's horrible to be live.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I would suggest everybody in the business has to embrace AI.
- Them: That's when the doctor waits. Yeah, absolutely. It could be really helpful and just, like, writing down everything in general. There's so much going on at the moment. So it's like if you don't write something down, you're just kind of forget.
- Me: Correct. And I can talk to you and concentrate, and I don't have to worry about taking notes. And I also don't have to worry about. Oh, I said I'd do that, and I've not done it. That's the stage I want to be getting to. So there's nothing falls through the get through the cracks.
- Them: Ting. Yeah.
- Me: That's the plan. That's the plan.
- Them: So just a few things. With the budgets at the moment. It's good that you've joined the Que, Alex as well. So just go through everything. So I've reduced the budget. I reduced them on Friday a lot.
- Me: Yeah, so that nice one.
- Them: And then I've reduced them again yesterday and now we're under spending, so I added a little bit more spend back on to that UK brand exact and the US brand exact. But apart from that, I'm going to probably just leave everything else and then we'll probably come in just under 14 114k.
- Me: Great.
- Them: If that's okay, Alex as well. So that's budget wise. And then in terms of Christmas rollout, so we've received all of the assets. I will share my screen. So because I've tried to split them out. So basically, we've had, like, one whole set of assets. Images and videos, and that's all we're getting for Christmas. So we have to split them into two so we don't get, like, creative fatigue. We'll have at first Christmas rollout from next week, and then from the 17th, we're going to be rolling out Black Friday stuff. So everything that's Christmas related will pause. And then after the two week of Black Friday, which is 17 November to 1 December, That's Black Friday. And then after that, we're going back to Christmas Phase two.
- Me: So that's all the creative for Christmas.
- Them: Yeah. So show you in here. So they've given us, like, the free PMAX sizes and. Yeah. So this is everything. Some of these we can't go live in because they're for spring. Someone.
- Me: All right. Ok. That's what I was worried about. Nice.
- Them: I don't know if I'm saying the financial year right. But, yeah, next year. So things like petrol can't go live yet. And then autumn briefcase, for example. And also this wine tote that can only go live in phase two of Christmas if we have the stock. But I've just read segment out everything else into, like, different product categories because I know people were talking. About letting out our pmax into different product groups? I don't know.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: If because of how many assets we have, I don't think we can really split into different campaigns. I don't think we have enough. But different asset groups could be a possibility.
- Me: That's what I was thinking. Rather than campaign.
- Them: Yeah, we know for certain. Yeah, that's fine. And then videos. We only have four videos, so we have a games video back gammon, I believe. And then diaries. I was hoping that I could try and repurpose this for notebooks as well, but when I looked at the video, it literally opens up and shows you the diary. By week, so you can't really do that.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: And then we have the lever accessories, so cooling and a multi zip curse or case. And then you can also use up like those accessories and women's accessories. So. Come back here. These are the videos we have, and we have them in, like, 18 seconds or 10 seconds. And then we also signal the fact that they're under metal. It's just to avoid duplicates for the team. And then we also have them. In landscape as well. And then there's going to be like a master video, which is more like a film that's still in progress. But we will get back soon, so we'll probably have like three, maybe three videos per asset group. But the problem is that with some product groups that were having there's not going to be any video because it's not relevant.
- Me: Did I. Did I show that with you?
- Them: And I don't think we can do that.
- Me: Suggest you want. We added Christmas one on, didn't it?
- Them: I don't think so, but I think it's maybe something that we both suggested or talked about last week. So what did I say?
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, I'd actually created some. No, I've not created them. I've got some suggestions for what they should be to start off with.
- Them: I'll leave you to it. But I'm going to redo the championship.
- Me: I didn't know whether I sent that over to you. If I've not, then I will do.
- Them: Ok? Yeah. Sounds good.
- Me: Straight after the first one is Christmas gifts. Because then we're going to do a vmax campaign just for Christmas.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Kids can I suggest and I don't know enough about onenote to know whether we can do this? There is Asset Studio within the account. Can we upload these into the Asset Studio so we can pull them in directly from there into the respective PMAX campaigns?
- Them: Not sure how quick. Yeah, like, I think I know even there's, like. Think I know what you mean, because that's sometimes what I'll do. I'll just, like, upload everything at once and then.
- Me: If. You go into tools that I decide, and then Asset Studios right at the very top. And then if we're clever the way we actually do the create the folders. Now, if you go to tools. On the left. That's it.
- Them: I can take action from the office.
- Me: And then no tools. Out. There.
- Them: Ok?
- Me: So if we can create a Christmas. So if you go to Asset Library, there.
- Them: Yeah, you can, like, upload everything and then it shows up in PMAX for you, yeah?
- Me: We create new there and do Christmas 2025. And then for all those breakdowns that you've got, if you can create the folders for those. So that I'll know straight away which ones they relate to.
- Them: Y. Eah. That's fine. So I know you said you're going to think they were like a list. So we. Do you want to, like, scrap these groups or, like, maybe, like, find how they would, like, merge together based on your list of my list?
- Me: I'm annoyed I've not sent that over to you.
- Them: I've also shared this with you. I can share the link as well. But I don't know enough about my. I'll put it in the other chat just so there's not like multiple paid search catch ups. Think about it. Seems like effective. Second week of the night. Can you see it? They've got.
- Me: I'm gonna have to send this up to. I can't find out where it is.
- Them: No worries. That's fine.
- Me: But if you could take that on board as to what they're going to look like and then maybe use that structure for the folder. It's just that transmission of information. I don't know the product particularly well.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it would be good to add your business knowledge to that, to be able to tell me what exactly they are and whether I can add them or not. And I think it might be useful having a sense check afterwards.
- Them: Because it's got. Great.
- Me: Just scanning through, just making sure the right images are in the right video.
- Them: Sending off today.
- Me: And preserve the brand somewhat, don't we?
- Them: Yeah, I spoke to. Yeah. Because that's what I had to, like, just split them into our product categories, but also how they. And then I've just. Yeah. Tried to look into phase one and phase two by a couple color coding.
- Me: Somewhat. No, we've got to preserve the brand.
- Them: So yeah, anything yellow is phase one, and I think in blue will be phase two and then anything. That's why it will be for both. We only have like one card image, so I'm. I've put that into gifts for him and guess for her.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: And then I think once I've looked at your list, Peter, and kind of merged it with mine, and I guess brand product groups, we can look at, like,
- Me: Just ping that over now.
- Them: Sorry.
- Me: I've just pinged that over to you now. I put it in the chat.
- Them: Thank you. Yeah. So, christmas gifts. Notebooks. Yeah, that's fine, but. No, but we've got to go and check. Travel accessories will kind of fall under lever accessories, and then I think maybe we should have a separate asset because it's a bag. So, yeah, it's a level. Accessories. Travel accessories. I think we should combine the travel accessories and card holders roster small leather goods. Oh, ready to go.
- Me: The only thing with that is that the intent on the travel accessories is it's a travel. It's for people who are traveling.
- Them: And then. There. Actually, I'm just going to pocket any five.
- Me: That was the thought behind that. The card holders and small libraries. I'm just thinking of audiences that we're actually going to be targeting with that and search themes. Because if we do the travel accessories, we can do gifts for travelers.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: And it'll just pop up, that one collection. It's going to take some playing around, doing listing groups, I think, for these, just making sure we're getting the right things.
- Them: We do have a travel edit. It was like a solid page for that. I like the automatic.
- Me: Was it?
- Them: Like taking it down. Oh, there it is.
- Me: Is that not it on that list of sent over?
- Them: Okay? Yeah.
- Me: It could be URL on there.
- Them: There was some kind of report. Right. Yeah. So we've got travel bags. Okay? So in terms of creatives, Let me put it here. So, I mean, from the Maybe only like, three.
- Me: You don't necessarily need to change the mail or on it, just the folder structure that we're using.
- Them: Yeah, sorry. I've just, like, put it like this just to kind of, like, make it easy for me to, like, visualize where a print is going. And then I'll, like, kind of, like, replicate this into Google Ads with the folders.
- Me: Okay? Wonderful.
- Them: Cool. To. And then we've got stationary. We don't have any, like, writing and paper stationary creatives.
- Me: We can always wake them up from the products themselves.
- Them: Do you mean, like? Sorry. Could you elaborate on what you mean?
- Me: I could just pull in some images from the actual product catalog. S.
- Them: I don't know if we're allowed to do that. I think everything has to be like.
- Me: It's your images.
- Them: Visually, like, has to come from these images. If you got. I mean, like. I don't know if you mean, like, generating images.
- Me: No, not generated, no. Just taking them out of the. Out of the catalog. If we had a group for travel, then it will just look. I'll just go and look at the travel products and pick some of the images from there.
- Them: I was in, like, the website images.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay? I'll ask Mark Tin if we can do that.
- Me: They are their images. It's not as though we're creating a display ad or anything for these.
- Them: Yeah, I know. You mean. It's just, I think, visually, like, they want to push, like, one message, which is like this Christmas hero campaign.
- Me: They are just what.
- Them: So, like, everything would need to be, like, consistent. So I. I would just need to check with them if they'd, like, be okay with us machine.
- Me: Full on display type campaign for this, what we're building. What I have in mind, what we're building with these PMAX groups is that we're actually building something for the future, that these will run all the time because we're going to get a higher rise out of these, we break them down. A bit further. So there is a longevity to them. This isn't a Christmas campaign I was proposing, this was a PMAX campaign that's going to have notebooks, travel accessories, card holders and so on, and the Christmas messaging around it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Is not, as you know, it's not full on in your face. This is people looking for notebooks. So if you think where these images are actually going to appear, they're going to appear as very small images next to the potentially next to the text assets in a search ad. Like quite small. And the other places they appear, they might appear in the display ad somewhere, but the actual spend on display is very small. If we're actually talking about doing Demand Gen or a video campaign or something like that, then yes, I'd say yes, let's do just do a Christmassy type assets all over the place. But these are very specific searches of a very specific products. And so hence the fact using the Creative from the product page itself would be more appropriate than actually using Christmas Creative.
- Them: I get what you mean. I think that should be okay. Yeah, I think that should be fine. Alex, do you think that will be okay? Like she's in the product page. Finding the context of what Peter's explained. Yeah. Cool.
- Me: Don't tell marketing. You'll have to explain the context all over again. It is important. It is important to know where they're going and how they're going to be displayed.
- Them: That's fine. And then we thought, well, it's in purses again. I can guess. In those images would come from the product page.
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: See these Christmas images will be great for the actual Christmas campaign where we're doing leather bags for Christmas or Christmas gifts for him, Christmas gifts for her.
- Them: Desk accessories.
- Me: They will be perfect. Because that's going to resonate then, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. I think all of these images can also go in the gifting campaign as well as, like, going in, like, our, I guess, our separate. Emacs asset groups as well. Yeah, we can, like, mix them up. Yeah. Pick accessories. Yeah, that's fine. Accessories. Cool. And then panama. Well, it doesn't look like that. You're all works.
- Me: That's the Panama one, is it?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: They're not taking it down. If you open the file, how do you book?
- Me: So that's going to be a search then, isn't it?
- Them: It together because my own.
- Me: If we do it as a search URL rather than a specific page. It's nice.
- Them: Do you think we'll be okay from, like, a landing page experience? Point of view.
- Me: What people are looking for.
- Them: To land on a search. Yeah.
- Me: It says, your search results for Panama. They're looking for Panama leather products, and there they are. If you were talking about SEO, I wouldn't necessarily say that was a great landing page for Panama, but from a page search perspective. Perspective where someone's very direct on what they're looking for, especially with something like that, I think that's fine.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: I'd question what sort of traffic winner get on that. But it's worth doing. Yeah.
- Them: Groups with clins. Yeah. Okay, cool. So what I'll do after this call, I'll pull up with, like, the full list, what we're going to be pushing, and then after that, we need the ad copy for it.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So if you want, we can exploit it into two and. Yeah, divide and conquer.
- Me: I'm more than happy to do that PMAX campaign for all of those asset groups. I'm okay with that. I would suggest that. If I create those. If you don't mind. If I create those, I'll create some assets for them. I'll pause the asset groups within there, and I'll tell you when they're done. And then you can look at them then. And I'll also try and produce something, a document that actually shows the assets text so that you can show through to marketing.
- Them: Yes, please. That would. Yeah, be cool. Yeah, that's fine.
- Me: Is that okay? Okay? We don't want to annoy them, do we? You know, that's worked really well last time. It's made things a lot quicker. But if we can be pushing rather than waiting them for them to produce it, then at least we can dictate which asset groups we want to do.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So you'll create the asset groups and there will be a mix of the product page images and the Christmas assets.
- Me: Yeah, that's the thing.
- Them: I'll see. Okay. I'll see if I can get you access to our. But, you know, I would just. Would it help if I just do the folders in Google this asset library?
- Me: It would be great if you could. Yeah.
- Them: Yeah, okay, I'll do that today.
- Me: It would be great. And it will need those for the US as well as the uk. Unfortunately, we can't share the asset studio between.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The.
- Them: I'll do them across all regions because we'll probably have them in, like, EU and Rest world, maybe. Actually, I don't think you can have logos on image extensions. No, you can't. We do have some images without logos, but they're. For meta. I'll ask if we can use those for image extensions, but for now I'll just add the asset library folders in the UK and us. Cool.
- Me: This. Is, we're going to smash this.
- Them: So. Yeah.
- Me: I think the whole thing about the budgets and projections, which I've done,
- Them: So.
- Me: The one saving grace is that one saving goes the opportunities the rest of the world. You know, last year there wasn't anything running on rest of world. And this year there is, and it does produce quite a decent roas, and it's at the right times. So I think whilst I apologize for projection, it is very specific, especially the 8:00, 5:00. I was asked it to be specific in that, giving it that context, but I think there's flexibility to move budget around if we feel as though we're getting a better roas.
- Them: Rry. Yeah, I had a look yesterday.
- Me: Say, you know, say we take 100 quid out of the UK and 100 quid out of the US, because I'm sticking to the rest of the world for the day, onto the daily budget, just because it's doing well. That will give us, possibly give us a better rate of return. But we're just going to have to keep on top of it.
- Them: Yeah. I think it'll make more sense as we go and go through it and. Yeah. I was gonna come on to that in a minute. And, yeah, if you want to go through the budget projections again, add a look yesterday.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: With the pain. Sorry. Launching on the PMAX campaign. So are we gonna have, like, one Peanuts Company with all the separate asset routes with different products? And then a separate gifting campaign, or is it just gonna be one campaign?
- Me: I would suggest so and then so for the pma.
- Them: Sorry. The letter.
- Me: I was going to say, if we do the PMAX Christmas and do themes and so on based around Christmas, totally round Christmas.
- Them: Yep.
- Me: I actually don't see that doing as much volume as the standard pmax. It's for one, it'll be new, and number two, we will be aiming it directly at Christmas gifts. When you think of what you search for at Christmas. If you wanted a gift for someone, you don't go? I don't know. Christmas gift for my Auntie Gertrude. You would have thought about it.
- Them: Yeah. You just look for the product. Yeah.
- Me: At least let's hope that there's some thought has gone into gifting at Christmas and that you don't just leave it to chance like that.
- Them: People.
- Me: So we will potentially be spending. Well, I think we will be spending more money on those generic PMAXes.
- Them: Yeah, people might put, like, purse gift or. Ag gift, maybe like the product plus gift.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, you know, VRP Max Group, I'll pay my current PMAX campaigns. Those are just going to be replaced with or like, revamped, essentially.
- Me: Well, we'll keep the asset group as the main asset group for the pma, Yeah.
- Them: Here are sidekick. Here. Inside kick asset group. Okay? And then we'll just create new ones.
- Me: Yes. And we'll look at volumes as to whether we remove the segmentation for here as a psychics, or we keep it in.
- Them: Okay? Yeah.
- Me: For those particular products. It depends what sort of volume we produce. There's going to be a certain amount of socket and C really with this, as to.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: What's working, what isn't working? We found that they're not producing the volume that we want. Then there's nothing wrong with actually taking the segmentation off. I've not looked at the segmentation recently in Products Hero, so I don't know where it sits. I don't know. How many products we've got in each of the individual segmentations, so I do need to check that out. Excuse me just for one minute, please. Just want.
- Them: Alex, our first call. Do you want to go to paid Social Creatives? And like the ads for that. Yeah, I think I might be for it. One I make myself free at one.
- Me: To.
- Them: Let me just have a quick look.
- Me: Please.
- Them: Two. I've got seb. Let's do one, then. That's fine. Yeah, I could. I need one, but. Or I can do after seb. That's better. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Is three okay? Yeah, three is fine.
- Me: Sorry.
- Them: No worries.
- Me: When the every email comes in, when it says when you're going to get a delivery, should you say when you're in a meeting?
- Them: It always happens. Or I get my doctor's course right in the middle of the meeting.
- Me: Sorry. Carry on.
- Them: It's always bad timing. No worries. So the new pmax product in the state robes, they're going to also have hero inside segmentation. They're not just going to be all purses, for example.
- Me: Now we'll have. I'll have a look at it. I'll see how it's going to. How it's going to segment out. We need a decent number of products in each section to be able, working.
- Them: Ok?
- Me: So if it means. Yeah, it's. It's going to depend upon the number of products per asset group, really. You know, we might just say, well, there's only going to be five products in there. Let's just do all of them rather than here as a sidekicks. I'm not saying we would have five products in an asset group, but let's look at the sizings of the listing groups and make the decision based upon that, because I'm sure there's some products that trigger off at Christmas and the rest of the year. Certainly I think we need to be doing a pmax. Well, you've done the PMAX Diaries, haven't you?
- Them: Ay. We have asset. We have asset groups for diaries in each here inside campaign.
- Me: Cool. Right. Ok. So there's also potential to take those out and stick them in their own campaign. So we can pile some budget into that. That's probably not a bad idea.
- Them: Yeah. Because there's search campaign. Such companies are already been doing really well, especially like in the uk.
- Me: Was that worth doing? Then let's take in the taking diaries out.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Creating a new PMAX campaign now, which is just for diaries.
- Them: Eating. Would it be worth it?
- Me: I'm suggesting that would. That probably would be worth it.
- Them: Yeah, it's definitely worth testing. Like, it's done well for my search perspective, so it would probably do really well and P Max as well.
- Me: Y. Eah. Well, that PMAX hns, that's, that's running at the moment. That's got. So that's got dari's aw25, which you've created. To create. To create a new PMAX campaign for diaries will be relatively straightforward, wouldn't it? Because we can just use that asset group.
- Them: Yeah, you could just copy it over and it'll be.
- Me: Yeah. Do you want me to do that?
- Them: I think it'll be. If you've got time. I'm also. I don't mind doing it.
- Me: Well, while I'm doing the asset groups anyway, I'll take that out and stick it into a new PMAX campaign.
- Them: Okay? That also has. Yeah. Horizon Sidekick segmentation from Product Hero.
- Me: Yeah. Thinking about it. From. Yeah, it's actually got old, Iris. It's not segmented. It's not segmented on H and S, that asset group. Which is fine. I think that's a good idea. I don't think there's any point in having HNS on there, because the heroes and psychics is looking back over a period of time. This is diaries. They're only just starting now. So let's not restrict the products that are actually. Being shown. So I'll just replicate the asset group in a new PMAX campaign. I'll apportion the budget dependent upon what it's been spending over the last couple of weeks.
- Them: I love story. What happened to the segmentation I did in product hair experiment when we went through it and we were looking and in product here at how to create like, A segmentation for diaries.
- Me: Job me to share my screen? I'm actually looking at it right now.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: So this is the hs diaries. Aw25.
- Them: Trying to get involved with everything.
- Me: So it's not segmenting them at all. We've got 253 in there. That's fine. I think that's it's learnt already. It's got history on those products. We might find for a couple of days. The PMAPS campaign might bomb, but there's sufficient traffic on there. Let's have a look. 30 days. Yeah, we got 50 conversions in 30 days, and no doubt that's gone like that recently. Probably best to do that. And then we've got. The others in there, which are on H and S. So, yeah, I'll just add new asset groups into there and move that other one out.
- Them: So you know how I created that segmentation in Product Hero? Where would I find that? Enlisting groups. Because you know how to, like, create it, like, level things, like product level free.
- Me: It's on the custom label. Thread.
- Them: Okay? But, like, if it's like a Diary Heroes Inside Kick segmentation that I've created in Product Hero, would that, like. And it's, like, named diaries.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Is that not meant to like?
- Me: It doesn't look at the name. The actual segmentation is done in priority. So it would say, do diaries first. Look for heroes and psychics and diaries based upon what criteria you've set. And then at the end, there's a catch all that. If nothing has been set for custom label 3, use this criteria for these heroes and sidekicks, so it would filter through that way. So your heroes and psychics for diaries might be 200% target ROAS, but then your catch all one at the bottom might be 300%, but it'll only use that one if it's not already been set prior to that point. So in your asset groups for the diaries, If you wanted to break this down further using heroes and sidekicks, you'd use Custom Label 3.
- Them: Do it from there.
- Me: And there you can see the way in which the diaries are set up. So these are specific to diaries now, because of that hierarchical structure that you've got for this listing group that's saying how many heroes and psychics diaries you have.
- Them: Okay? So then that would show. So that hero's group under diaries. Would split it out. The content criteria that I set in Product Hero.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Yeah. Okay?
- Them: Cool. So, yeah, that's all for Christmas. And then I. I noticed you put in the ad copy for the brand stationery. I saw that. So I know into, like, improved the ad copy for the other campaigns. I can work on that. I'll start with like UK and then move on to us. When? Book some time. And then I'm still working on negative SQLs as well. I've just been trying to sort out this incremental revenue. Today. And then.
- Me: I appreciate you doing that, Lauren.
- Them: Final thing is. Yeah. Your budget recommendations.
- Me: Okay, let me share this.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: We've got super complicated. It got super complicated because we were saying, with double counting on the UK for the purchase conversion action, the same was true for the US as well.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Which was also stopped back in April. So doing year on year comparisons have had to use the purchase conversion action to work out where there's been increases in conversion rate. So the first thing this is just to reiterate the budgets that have been agreed. So that's the total budget for November and the total budget for December. And what percentage of the budget each one of these the regions actually are going to use. So I've looked at an average here to find out what these percentages are. So again, just, it's just going to be indicative, but at least we can track the budgets per geographical location.
- Them: Is this? Is budget open to, like being fluid, like, for example.
- Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Them: If okay.
- Me: Yeah, and that's what I mean. This really isn't me to be this precise, but I know the business needs this information to start off with, and just so long as just along the dot line at the bottom is correct.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, I don't, I don't think an extra 1 or 2% for each of these locations is going to make much difference to in the grand scheme of things, especially if we decide that we've got 5.7% for the rest of the world. If that went up to 8%, because we're going to get a higher roas, then it would be more of a pat on the back rather than why didn't you hit 5.7%? Okay, so this was the. Just out of interest, the conversion rate analysis for the US and the uk. For last year. Quite interesting. How. The US is lower. I mean, it's a lower point anyway because of the fact it's a UK company is shipping out to the us. But also, it wasn't as severe between October and November, the actual increase, and that's reflected really in the way we can play around with the roas. So. That's just a reflection of the difference between the two of them. So then looking at the conversion rates over the months. So this is just an explainer of the way in which I've worked out what the increases should be and when to spend the money, when to drop the target rise. So this is the story behind it. So the UK went from 4.54% to 5.74% in November, 5.95 in December. OK, so Pete was December. So we're seeing an uplift. Of q4 to q3 to q4. Of 31% last year for UK and 22% for the US. So that's the justification of playing around with budgets, playing around with target roas, because the indicators are that the conversion rate is going to go up in November and December and we're going to make some more money. Now you could say at the end of the day, and excuse my French. No, Sherlock, we're going to do better at Christmas. But at least it gives it a number to look at. And that increase has been used to work out when to drop the target. Roas. Ok, so you can see rest of the world. It's rubbish. That starts, it's not really telling us anything. But as I say, this is potentially an opportunity for us to try and get more out of rest of the world over the Christmas period, because there was Nothing back in December2024. For rest of world. Maybe it could have been last shipping dates. We're going to take that into consideration as well the rest of the world. I don't know when the cut off is likely to be for shipping and also for Europe. We will have to take that into consideration as to what we do with the budgets around about that time. Because if people aren't going to Christmas, I would suggest we drop the budgets. Around about that time. And increase the target roas.
- Them: I think the management finance.
- Me: That was a sage nod to that was Alex. This is a wise old.
- Them: Yeah, we've got those. All those dates. Are pretty much confirmed because they won't have changed much of last year.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: But a bit a day or two difference.
- Me: If you could ping them over, mate, that'd be great. It was in the G sheet or whatever that. I can plug those into this.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. We'll do.
- Me: Ok, so again, these are just explainers. On where the conversion rates are going to go. The key findings and then we've got the implementation timetable here. As to what we're going to do with the row, I think it was a better description further on. Where the heck is it? So I've not looked at this since a few days ago. We've got all the guardrails here as to. As to where we expect things to be at certain times as well. So we can see how it's actually what the trajectory of the strategy is going to be. There was a target, Roas.
- Them: That.
- Me: Explainer.
- Them: Which. Is a bit about the weekly pallet date and weekly monitoring and validation protocol. It's just.
- Me: Here we go. Here we go. So 29th to the 14th, we've got a 15% ROAS reduction. So that's from tomorrow. Yeah, it's from tomorrow. 15% for the UK. And that's the projected spend over the period.
- Them: Very.
- Me: Us just days. It is 10% reduction for Europe and standard for the rest of the world. Then from the 15th to the 30th. I'm saying Thanksgiving scaling. It's also Black Friday scaling as well.
- Them: Good.
- Me: We're maintaining that 15% for the UK. Dropping the US by 10%. Maintaining the European one and reducing rest of world by 10%. So then, versus the 15th of December, when we're on peak, we will be at 15% reduction. For most of them, apart from rest of world, which will be 10%. It's 10% because it was insufficient data, really, for the rest of the world to warrant it going any further than that. But we could potentially drop that further. And then carrying on with the reductions over all the way up to the 31st. We go into sales straight after Christmas.
- Them: Thankful. Ly. I feel like you can find 24th, it'll be better.
- Me: Right. So that will reduction will stay there.
- Them: On.
- Me: Until we get back into some level of normality. And before that point, I can work out what to do with the ROAS target then anyway, based upon the performance that there's been. So I think what I'll do is I will. I'm going to rejig this because to me, it makes sense. There's been a progression of this. I think the actual ROAS reductions and the budgeting is sound, but it's just a little bit unreadable. So what I'll do is I'll get it to consolidate this. As to the action plan for when to reduce roas, what budget to expect for each week, because no point in doing daily, we just do it per week so we can actually see how that's moving. And then we can compare the projected against what you have in your budget planner.
- Them: The waiver.
- Me: What it's telling you what your trajectory of your budget is.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it'll just make it a little bit more track. I'll simplify it.
- Them: Yes, please.
- Me: So that we could all understand. I think I was very mindful of the fact. I wanted to justify it. I didn't trust it. So when it says about the percentages, all the way along, I've gone through and checked them all just to make sure it's right, just to make sure they were. Actually those conversion rate reductions, because we don't want to be making these reductions when the conversion rate actually went up that week. So the key points really are from tomorrow to the 15th, the 15th to the 30th versus the 15th, and the 16th to the 31st. Those are our key periods. And the things that we're going to be discussing going forward as to whether we're actually hitting those points or not. Now, if we do hit those points, those were the revenue figures. Of where we expect to be on those budgets. So we're on a total Q4 revenue of 1.6. Yes. So that will include October as well. So revenue 819 for December and 8, 25 for November. Do you have it broken down to that level, Alex, or not?
- Them: I've got the revenue target. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Country. And month, probably down to.
- Me: And how are we with that? Does that. Does that match up with your expectations?
- Them: Wait. Y. Eah.
- Me: Ok, cool. That's the right answer. Good. Right. Which is great, because if you think the basis of this I've plugged in a budget. I plugged in an expectation and conversion rate and an expectation of revenue. What I did do is say, this is where we want to be and how are we going to do it? So it's actually come out from a different angle. So I'm pleased with that. Good. Nice one. Don't worry about these here. Then, Lauren at 4pM. That's what we're going to do.
- Them: I can just look at the financial projections bit and then 15 rows reduction is that of course like all campaigned.
- Me: So we say again.
- Them: You've mentioned about like making a 15 rows reduction tomorrow. And so it's that, like. Across all campaigns, okay?
- Me: Across. The board. Yeah.
- Them: I'm not. And then usa says standard roas. So do you mean to, like, keep it as it is?
- Me: Well, whatever the ROAS target is at the moment, we're just going to take 15% off it.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: But I say I'll clarify that in this if this isn't going to break it down by campaign, because the campaign's last year were completely different to this year. So we have to do it across the board and actually do some juggling that if one campaign is struggling and it's bringing a whole lot down, then we shift it back again.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So whilst this is literally just a framework going back to what you said before, this really isn't set in stone. This is just where we would like to be. But that's our skill in managing it. And making sure we actually are actually hitting those targets.
- Them: Just looking for the. Sheet that Alex gave us last week with the projects. And like new shifted budgets. Give me a second. Scenario, or it'll be in the Digital Marketing Master.
- Me: It was. On. Just. I think when I pulled it from now, because I know it was in the chat as well, wasn't it?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Oh, there we go.
- Them: Cool. I'm just trying to look at like what all went on the self aware. Yeah, I've got the additional sprints. I'm just looking at what are.
- Me: Have you got it? Ok?
- Them: Threshold. So. 70.
- Me: Can be really confusing.
- Them: So.
- Me: That they're not actually calendar months. Are they specific?
- Them: Alex, am I correct in thinking about all Google adware should still be 6.02. That's still the target. I'm just looking in the digital marketing master in the paid search tab. Be better for that. It'd be probably better off looking in the additional spend. Shit. Okay? That's the latest view in there. So that has the new budget sitting there. Yeah. As your totals as well I should have. Cool. The bit where it says paid search, seasonal uplift, and it's got, like, the revenue. Is that just for. That's just for the additional. Right. Where are you looking? Sorry. So you've got Roys 7 to or 6 to 12 by month. And you've got total additional spend in budget plus additional. Yeah. So you've got that bit and the kind of, like, box next to it where it says you've got, like, spend revenue and then roas. So we're just looking at that bit because the new, like, box you've done from, I guess, like Colin's and R, it has the budget but not necessarily the revenue target. Because I'm just trying to figure out, like, what row. What's like. The standard, Ross, that we should be at at the moment. Well, yeah. So this has only got so to do that we have to add so that box you're looking at has any goal. What the additional spend needs to drive. Yeah. As in what the. Sorry, what the. The additional overall spend is so like the bits that say like 114k the budget in a plus additional space. So from m6 to. Yeah, r12. That's just budget, right? Yeah. I'm going to see if I've got another sheet which will show this clearer.
- Me: Now, the average roas in, for instance, in the. For the uk. In q4 roas 2024 for the uk was 8.88. So we should smash those grass targets.
- Them: You can use the paid search tab in the digital marketing sheet, but it just needs checking that they spend adds up. So for October, they're the same. They're both 140. I'll add in the November. Onward spends. Okay, and then that changes. So I can look at row row eight, right? As what our target for Google Ads is. Yeah, providing. All of those spend numbers. Reflect the latest bend of having want to produce that table. I've just updated them so order spends under total budget reflect what's in your additional spend. Scenario, the ones that you put in on Friday. Yeah. Yeah. So for my revenue point of view, it's the budget tracker numbers. Plus the additional budget number, additional revenue target, and then the spend is just the original Splend plus the additional spend. And that should add up on that sheet. Okay? I've only updated the spend for the section in like Navy. So I'll just. I'll just focus on that.
- Me: I'm really sorry, guys. I'm going to jump off in a couple of minutes.
- Them: No, that's. Everything can tend to 12. Hasn't changed. It's just the additional has changed, hasn't it? Yeah. So it's just making sure those additional numbers. Are what they are. In the new version. And if they are, then that should add up to the totals. Just going to update the shoulders. Normally. I think the original spend. Where your cursor is right now. Ok. No, that's fine. Ok? It's just loads of wealthy people that big. Mentor health institution. But just so we can probably do this budget stuff offline if needed. But are there any other bits we need to run through? No, I think we're ok.
- Me: I'll simplify those numbers for you in the action plan. But I mean the principles there. The plan should work. Famous last words. And I am recording this. Ok, we said anything else, just give us a shout.
- Them: Well do. Thanks, peter.
- Me: Ok? I'll get that over to you today.
- Them: Ok, thank you.
- Me: All right. Cheers, guys.
- Them: Js thank you.

## Strategic Decisions

- Split Christmas creative assets into two phases to avoid creative fatigue

--- Full Transcript ---

Me: So you're going to allocate them automatically to. What's the fail safe on this? Can you email me a summary every week? Of what meeting notes have been put against what customers. Hello.
Them: Great. I just wanted to heaven my headphones, otherwise the whole office would have been able to hear you.
Me: I'm not quite either, am I?
Them: No, you're actually very quiet. But I was like, just in case.
Me: Well, I've just bought. An AI dictation services. I've told you before, it's called whisper flow. And I don't type a lot now. I actually just talk it through.
Them: Notes, everything.
Me: It does voice the text, but in any text box you could possibly think of, even, like, a URL bar, it'll do it. And I'm very conscious that. Hi, Alex. I'm very conscious that I want to make it as clear as possible when I'm doing it, so I actually bought a boom. Mic, which is literally just here.
Them: I've got a. Alex. Anything else.
Me: So I'm sat with this right under my nose all day, every day with a keyboard in front of me. So my wife says I look like a DJ or something. He's only the microphone that makes me look like a dj. Make that clear.
Them: So. On your paid search decks.
Me: Yes, that's right.
Them: Just pressing button. No, it's probably, like, really useful. It probably saves a lot of time. I need to find something like that because I know like Google reps or other media owners, they tend to use that.
Me: Yeah. It's massive, Lauren. It's absolutely massive. I had a meeting this morning at quarter past five. It was with someone in Australia, an AI course that I'm doing. And his courses are okay, but he does tell you stuff like that. It's like at the moment I'm recording this with. I need to say that now. Don't I like the Google reps, do I? You don't mind if I record this meeting, do you? But I've literally just written a little script. At the end of this meeting, it will take that and drop it into the Smyson folder so that I can refer to this in the future.
Them: One.
Me: Or the AI will refer to it in the future. Said, are there any action plans that you have at the moment? And it'll go. Look at all my clients say, well, yeah, we said you were going to do this, we're going to do that, follow this up.
Them: To use the Frontier sales to.
Me: Absolutely incredible. Behind this screen now got on teams. It's got three processes running which are creating AI procedures. Stuff like that. It looks at all the emails. It'll take the emails details into against the client. So I'm not missing anything at all.
Them: Stop tv. It's something you pay for. This is all.
Me: But it's basically when you get up past five. Whisper flow is $10 a month. No, it's not. For the amount it saves, you say 135 words per minute. I can talk and it will do it. It will keep up with that. I think. Well, Claude, I'm paying 80 pound a month for which is worth every single penny. It's like having half a dozen VAs working for you. And I use cursor, which it's for doing code. So. Which sounds really techy, but you just say, I want to be able to do this. This is a repetitive task that I do every month. I have to create this spreadsheet based upon last month's data. Can you go and do it for me? And it's a repetitive thing, but every time you refer to that in the future, it will know what you're talking about and it will go and do it. So I've got a project now called Pete's Brain.
Them: Going to be a good.
Me: And it's basically everything that I know about clients. And about marketing and what I've done with them, what we're going to be proposed to do in the future. It is pretty mind blowing. As this guy says, it's a great time to be alive. If you want to embrace it. If you don't, it's horrible to be live.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I would suggest everybody in the business has to embrace AI.
Them: That's when the doctor waits. Yeah, absolutely. It could be really helpful and just, like, writing down everything in general. There's so much going on at the moment. So it's like if you don't write something down, you're just kind of forget.
Me: Correct. And I can talk to you and concentrate, and I don't have to worry about taking notes. And I also don't have to worry about. Oh, I said I'd do that, and I've not done it. That's the stage I want to be getting to. So there's nothing falls through the get through the cracks.
Them: Ting. Yeah.
Me: That's the plan. That's the plan.
Them: So just a few things. With the budgets at the moment. It's good that you've joined the Que, Alex as well. So just go through everything. So I've reduced the budget. I reduced them on Friday a lot.
Me: Yeah, so that nice one.
Them: And then I've reduced them again yesterday and now we're under spending, so I added a little bit more spend back on to that UK brand exact and the US brand exact. But apart from that, I'm going to probably just leave everything else and then we'll probably come in just under 14 114k.
Me: Great.
Them: If that's okay, Alex as well. So that's budget wise. And then in terms of Christmas rollout, so we've received all of the assets. I will share my screen. So because I've tried to split them out. So basically, we've had, like, one whole set of assets. Images and videos, and that's all we're getting for Christmas. So we have to split them into two so we don't get, like, creative fatigue. We'll have at first Christmas rollout from next week, and then from the 17th, we're going to be rolling out Black Friday stuff. So everything that's Christmas related will pause. And then after the two week of Black Friday, which is 17 November to 1 December, That's Black Friday. And then after that, we're going back to Christmas Phase two.
Me: So that's all the creative for Christmas.
Them: Yeah. So show you in here. So they've given us, like, the free PMAX sizes and. Yeah. So this is everything. Some of these we can't go live in because they're for spring. Someone.
Me: All right. Ok. That's what I was worried about. Nice.
Them: I don't know if I'm saying the financial year right. But, yeah, next year. So things like petrol can't go live yet. And then autumn briefcase, for example. And also this wine tote that can only go live in phase two of Christmas if we have the stock. But I've just read segment out everything else into, like, different product categories because I know people were talking. About letting out our pmax into different product groups? I don't know.
Me: Yeah.
Them: If because of how many assets we have, I don't think we can really split into different campaigns. I don't think we have enough. But different asset groups could be a possibility.
Me: That's what I was thinking. Rather than campaign.
Them: Yeah, we know for certain. Yeah, that's fine. And then videos. We only have four videos, so we have a games video back gammon, I believe. And then diaries. I was hoping that I could try and repurpose this for notebooks as well, but when I looked at the video, it literally opens up and shows you the diary. By week, so you can't really do that.
Me: Ok?
Them: And then we have the lever accessories, so cooling and a multi zip curse or case. And then you can also use up like those accessories and women's accessories. So. Come back here. These are the videos we have, and we have them in, like, 18 seconds or 10 seconds. And then we also signal the fact that they're under metal. It's just to avoid duplicates for the team. And then we also have them. In landscape as well. And then there's going to be like a master video, which is more like a film that's still in progress. But we will get back soon, so we'll probably have like three, maybe three videos per asset group. But the problem is that with some product groups that were having there's not going to be any video because it's not relevant.
Me: Did I. Did I show that with you?
Them: And I don't think we can do that.
Me: Suggest you want. We added Christmas one on, didn't it?
Them: I don't think so, but I think it's maybe something that we both suggested or talked about last week. So what did I say?
Me: Yeah. Yeah, I'd actually created some. No, I've not created them. I've got some suggestions for what they should be to start off with.
Them: I'll leave you to it. But I'm going to redo the championship.
Me: I didn't know whether I sent that over to you. If I've not, then I will do.
Them: Ok? Yeah. Sounds good.
Me: Straight after the first one is Christmas gifts. Because then we're going to do a vmax campaign just for Christmas.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Kids can I suggest and I don't know enough about onenote to know whether we can do this? There is Asset Studio within the account. Can we upload these into the Asset Studio so we can pull them in directly from there into the respective PMAX campaigns?
Them: Not sure how quick. Yeah, like, I think I know even there's, like. Think I know what you mean, because that's sometimes what I'll do. I'll just, like, upload everything at once and then.
Me: If. You go into tools that I decide, and then Asset Studios right at the very top. And then if we're clever the way we actually do the create the folders. Now, if you go to tools. On the left. That's it.
Them: I can take action from the office.
Me: And then no tools. Out. There.
Them: Ok?
Me: So if we can create a Christmas. So if you go to Asset Library, there.
Them: Yeah, you can, like, upload everything and then it shows up in PMAX for you, yeah?
Me: We create new there and do Christmas 2025. And then for all those breakdowns that you've got, if you can create the folders for those. So that I'll know straight away which ones they relate to.
Them: Y. Eah. That's fine. So I know you said you're going to think they were like a list. So we. Do you want to, like, scrap these groups or, like, maybe, like, find how they would, like, merge together based on your list of my list?
Me: I'm annoyed I've not sent that over to you.
Them: I've also shared this with you. I can share the link as well. But I don't know enough about my. I'll put it in the other chat just so there's not like multiple paid search catch ups. Think about it. Seems like effective. Second week of the night. Can you see it? They've got.
Me: I'm gonna have to send this up to. I can't find out where it is.
Them: No worries. That's fine.
Me: But if you could take that on board as to what they're going to look like and then maybe use that structure for the folder. It's just that transmission of information. I don't know the product particularly well.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it would be good to add your business knowledge to that, to be able to tell me what exactly they are and whether I can add them or not. And I think it might be useful having a sense check afterwards.
Them: Because it's got. Great.
Me: Just scanning through, just making sure the right images are in the right video.
Them: Sending off today.
Me: And preserve the brand somewhat, don't we?
Them: Yeah, I spoke to. Yeah. Because that's what I had to, like, just split them into our product categories, but also how they. And then I've just. Yeah. Tried to look into phase one and phase two by a couple color coding.
Me: Somewhat. No, we've got to preserve the brand.
Them: So yeah, anything yellow is phase one, and I think in blue will be phase two and then anything. That's why it will be for both. We only have like one card image, so I'm. I've put that into gifts for him and guess for her.
Me: Okay?
Them: And then I think once I've looked at your list, Peter, and kind of merged it with mine, and I guess brand product groups, we can look at, like,
Me: Just ping that over now.
Them: Sorry.
Me: I've just pinged that over to you now. I put it in the chat.
Them: Thank you. Yeah. So, christmas gifts. Notebooks. Yeah, that's fine, but. No, but we've got to go and check. Travel accessories will kind of fall under lever accessories, and then I think maybe we should have a separate asset because it's a bag. So, yeah, it's a level. Accessories. Travel accessories. I think we should combine the travel accessories and card holders roster small leather goods. Oh, ready to go.
Me: The only thing with that is that the intent on the travel accessories is it's a travel. It's for people who are traveling.
Them: And then. There. Actually, I'm just going to pocket any five.
Me: That was the thought behind that. The card holders and small libraries. I'm just thinking of audiences that we're actually going to be targeting with that and search themes. Because if we do the travel accessories, we can do gifts for travelers.
Them: Okay?
Me: And it'll just pop up, that one collection. It's going to take some playing around, doing listing groups, I think, for these, just making sure we're getting the right things.
Them: We do have a travel edit. It was like a solid page for that. I like the automatic.
Me: Was it?
Them: Like taking it down. Oh, there it is.
Me: Is that not it on that list of sent over?
Them: Okay? Yeah.
Me: It could be URL on there.
Them: There was some kind of report. Right. Yeah. So we've got travel bags. Okay? So in terms of creatives, Let me put it here. So, I mean, from the Maybe only like, three.
Me: You don't necessarily need to change the mail or on it, just the folder structure that we're using.
Them: Yeah, sorry. I've just, like, put it like this just to kind of, like, make it easy for me to, like, visualize where a print is going. And then I'll, like, kind of, like, replicate this into Google Ads with the folders.
Me: Okay? Wonderful.
Them: Cool. To. And then we've got stationary. We don't have any, like, writing and paper stationary creatives.
Me: We can always wake them up from the products themselves.
Them: Do you mean, like? Sorry. Could you elaborate on what you mean?
Me: I could just pull in some images from the actual product catalog. S.
Them: I don't know if we're allowed to do that. I think everything has to be like.
Me: It's your images.
Them: Visually, like, has to come from these images. If you got. I mean, like. I don't know if you mean, like, generating images.
Me: No, not generated, no. Just taking them out of the. Out of the catalog. If we had a group for travel, then it will just look. I'll just go and look at the travel products and pick some of the images from there.
Them: I was in, like, the website images.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay? I'll ask Mark Tin if we can do that.
Me: They are their images. It's not as though we're creating a display ad or anything for these.
Them: Yeah, I know. You mean. It's just, I think, visually, like, they want to push, like, one message, which is like this Christmas hero campaign.
Me: They are just what.
Them: So, like, everything would need to be, like, consistent. So I. I would just need to check with them if they'd, like, be okay with us machine.
Me: Full on display type campaign for this, what we're building. What I have in mind, what we're building with these PMAX groups is that we're actually building something for the future, that these will run all the time because we're going to get a higher rise out of these, we break them down. A bit further. So there is a longevity to them. This isn't a Christmas campaign I was proposing, this was a PMAX campaign that's going to have notebooks, travel accessories, card holders and so on, and the Christmas messaging around it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Is not, as you know, it's not full on in your face. This is people looking for notebooks. So if you think where these images are actually going to appear, they're going to appear as very small images next to the potentially next to the text assets in a search ad. Like quite small. And the other places they appear, they might appear in the display ad somewhere, but the actual spend on display is very small. If we're actually talking about doing Demand Gen or a video campaign or something like that, then yes, I'd say yes, let's do just do a Christmassy type assets all over the place. But these are very specific searches of a very specific products. And so hence the fact using the Creative from the product page itself would be more appropriate than actually using Christmas Creative.
Them: I get what you mean. I think that should be okay. Yeah, I think that should be fine. Alex, do you think that will be okay? Like she's in the product page. Finding the context of what Peter's explained. Yeah. Cool.
Me: Don't tell marketing. You'll have to explain the context all over again. It is important. It is important to know where they're going and how they're going to be displayed.
Them: That's fine. And then we thought, well, it's in purses again. I can guess. In those images would come from the product page.
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: Cool.
Me: See these Christmas images will be great for the actual Christmas campaign where we're doing leather bags for Christmas or Christmas gifts for him, Christmas gifts for her.
Them: Desk accessories.
Me: They will be perfect. Because that's going to resonate then, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. I think all of these images can also go in the gifting campaign as well as, like, going in, like, our, I guess, our separate. Emacs asset groups as well. Yeah, we can, like, mix them up. Yeah. Pick accessories. Yeah, that's fine. Accessories. Cool. And then panama. Well, it doesn't look like that. You're all works.
Me: That's the Panama one, is it?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Okay?
Them: They're not taking it down. If you open the file, how do you book?
Me: So that's going to be a search then, isn't it?
Them: It together because my own.
Me: If we do it as a search URL rather than a specific page. It's nice.
Them: Do you think we'll be okay from, like, a landing page experience? Point of view.
Me: What people are looking for.
Them: To land on a search. Yeah.
Me: It says, your search results for Panama. They're looking for Panama leather products, and there they are. If you were talking about SEO, I wouldn't necessarily say that was a great landing page for Panama, but from a page search perspective. Perspective where someone's very direct on what they're looking for, especially with something like that, I think that's fine.
Them: Okay?
Me: I'd question what sort of traffic winner get on that. But it's worth doing. Yeah.
Them: Groups with clins. Yeah. Okay, cool. So what I'll do after this call, I'll pull up with, like, the full list, what we're going to be pushing, and then after that, we need the ad copy for it.
Me: Okay?
Them: So if you want, we can exploit it into two and. Yeah, divide and conquer.
Me: I'm more than happy to do that PMAX campaign for all of those asset groups. I'm okay with that. I would suggest that. If I create those. If you don't mind. If I create those, I'll create some assets for them. I'll pause the asset groups within there, and I'll tell you when they're done. And then you can look at them then. And I'll also try and produce something, a document that actually shows the assets text so that you can show through to marketing.
Them: Yes, please. That would. Yeah, be cool. Yeah, that's fine.
Me: Is that okay? Okay? We don't want to annoy them, do we? You know, that's worked really well last time. It's made things a lot quicker. But if we can be pushing rather than waiting them for them to produce it, then at least we can dictate which asset groups we want to do.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
Me: Okay?
Them: So you'll create the asset groups and there will be a mix of the product page images and the Christmas assets.
Me: Yeah, that's the thing.
Them: I'll see. Okay. I'll see if I can get you access to our. But, you know, I would just. Would it help if I just do the folders in Google this asset library?
Me: It would be great if you could. Yeah.
Them: Yeah, okay, I'll do that today.
Me: It would be great. And it will need those for the US as well as the uk. Unfortunately, we can't share the asset studio between.
Them: Yeah.
Me: The.
Them: I'll do them across all regions because we'll probably have them in, like, EU and Rest world, maybe. Actually, I don't think you can have logos on image extensions. No, you can't. We do have some images without logos, but they're. For meta. I'll ask if we can use those for image extensions, but for now I'll just add the asset library folders in the UK and us. Cool.
Me: This. Is, we're going to smash this.
Them: So. Yeah.
Me: I think the whole thing about the budgets and projections, which I've done,
Them: So.
Me: The one saving grace is that one saving goes the opportunities the rest of the world. You know, last year there wasn't anything running on rest of world. And this year there is, and it does produce quite a decent roas, and it's at the right times. So I think whilst I apologize for projection, it is very specific, especially the 8:00, 5:00. I was asked it to be specific in that, giving it that context, but I think there's flexibility to move budget around if we feel as though we're getting a better roas.
Them: Rry. Yeah, I had a look yesterday.
Me: Say, you know, say we take 100 quid out of the UK and 100 quid out of the US, because I'm sticking to the rest of the world for the day, onto the daily budget, just because it's doing well. That will give us, possibly give us a better rate of return. But we're just going to have to keep on top of it.
Them: Yeah. I think it'll make more sense as we go and go through it and. Yeah. I was gonna come on to that in a minute. And, yeah, if you want to go through the budget projections again, add a look yesterday.
Me: Ok?
Them: With the pain. Sorry. Launching on the PMAX campaign. So are we gonna have, like, one Peanuts Company with all the separate asset routes with different products? And then a separate gifting campaign, or is it just gonna be one campaign?
Me: I would suggest so and then so for the pma.
Them: Sorry. The letter.
Me: I was going to say, if we do the PMAX Christmas and do themes and so on based around Christmas, totally round Christmas.
Them: Yep.
Me: I actually don't see that doing as much volume as the standard pmax. It's for one, it'll be new, and number two, we will be aiming it directly at Christmas gifts. When you think of what you search for at Christmas. If you wanted a gift for someone, you don't go? I don't know. Christmas gift for my Auntie Gertrude. You would have thought about it.
Them: Yeah. You just look for the product. Yeah.
Me: At least let's hope that there's some thought has gone into gifting at Christmas and that you don't just leave it to chance like that.
Them: People.
Me: So we will potentially be spending. Well, I think we will be spending more money on those generic PMAXes.
Them: Yeah, people might put, like, purse gift or. Ag gift, maybe like the product plus gift.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So, you know, VRP Max Group, I'll pay my current PMAX campaigns. Those are just going to be replaced with or like, revamped, essentially.
Me: Well, we'll keep the asset group as the main asset group for the pma, Yeah.
Them: Here are sidekick. Here. Inside kick asset group. Okay? And then we'll just create new ones.
Me: Yes. And we'll look at volumes as to whether we remove the segmentation for here as a psychics, or we keep it in.
Them: Okay? Yeah.
Me: For those particular products. It depends what sort of volume we produce. There's going to be a certain amount of socket and C really with this, as to.
Them: Okay?
Me: What's working, what isn't working? We found that they're not producing the volume that we want. Then there's nothing wrong with actually taking the segmentation off. I've not looked at the segmentation recently in Products Hero, so I don't know where it sits. I don't know. How many products we've got in each of the individual segmentations, so I do need to check that out. Excuse me just for one minute, please. Just want.
Them: Alex, our first call. Do you want to go to paid Social Creatives? And like the ads for that. Yeah, I think I might be for it. One I make myself free at one.
Me: To.
Them: Let me just have a quick look.
Me: Please.
Them: Two. I've got seb. Let's do one, then. That's fine. Yeah, I could. I need one, but. Or I can do after seb. That's better. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Is three okay? Yeah, three is fine.
Me: Sorry.
Them: No worries.
Me: When the every email comes in, when it says when you're going to get a delivery, should you say when you're in a meeting?
Them: It always happens. Or I get my doctor's course right in the middle of the meeting.
Me: Sorry. Carry on.
Them: It's always bad timing. No worries. So the new pmax product in the state robes, they're going to also have hero inside segmentation. They're not just going to be all purses, for example.
Me: Now we'll have. I'll have a look at it. I'll see how it's going to. How it's going to segment out. We need a decent number of products in each section to be able, working.
Them: Ok?
Me: So if it means. Yeah, it's. It's going to depend upon the number of products per asset group, really. You know, we might just say, well, there's only going to be five products in there. Let's just do all of them rather than here as a sidekicks. I'm not saying we would have five products in an asset group, but let's look at the sizings of the listing groups and make the decision based upon that, because I'm sure there's some products that trigger off at Christmas and the rest of the year. Certainly I think we need to be doing a pmax. Well, you've done the PMAX Diaries, haven't you?
Them: Ay. We have asset. We have asset groups for diaries in each here inside campaign.
Me: Cool. Right. Ok. So there's also potential to take those out and stick them in their own campaign. So we can pile some budget into that. That's probably not a bad idea.
Them: Yeah. Because there's search campaign. Such companies are already been doing really well, especially like in the uk.
Me: Was that worth doing? Then let's take in the taking diaries out.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Creating a new PMAX campaign now, which is just for diaries.
Them: Eating. Would it be worth it?
Me: I'm suggesting that would. That probably would be worth it.
Them: Yeah, it's definitely worth testing. Like, it's done well for my search perspective, so it would probably do really well and P Max as well.
Me: Y. Eah. Well, that PMAX hns, that's, that's running at the moment. That's got. So that's got dari's aw25, which you've created. To create. To create a new PMAX campaign for diaries will be relatively straightforward, wouldn't it? Because we can just use that asset group.
Them: Yeah, you could just copy it over and it'll be.
Me: Yeah. Do you want me to do that?
Them: I think it'll be. If you've got time. I'm also. I don't mind doing it.
Me: Well, while I'm doing the asset groups anyway, I'll take that out and stick it into a new PMAX campaign.
Them: Okay? That also has. Yeah. Horizon Sidekick segmentation from Product Hero.
Me: Yeah. Thinking about it. From. Yeah, it's actually got old, Iris. It's not segmented. It's not segmented on H and S, that asset group. Which is fine. I think that's a good idea. I don't think there's any point in having HNS on there, because the heroes and psychics is looking back over a period of time. This is diaries. They're only just starting now. So let's not restrict the products that are actually. Being shown. So I'll just replicate the asset group in a new PMAX campaign. I'll apportion the budget dependent upon what it's been spending over the last couple of weeks.
Them: I love story. What happened to the segmentation I did in product hair experiment when we went through it and we were looking and in product here at how to create like, A segmentation for diaries.
Me: Job me to share my screen? I'm actually looking at it right now.
Them: Yes.
Me: So this is the hs diaries. Aw25.
Them: Trying to get involved with everything.
Me: So it's not segmenting them at all. We've got 253 in there. That's fine. I think that's it's learnt already. It's got history on those products. We might find for a couple of days. The PMAPS campaign might bomb, but there's sufficient traffic on there. Let's have a look. 30 days. Yeah, we got 50 conversions in 30 days, and no doubt that's gone like that recently. Probably best to do that. And then we've got. The others in there, which are on H and S. So, yeah, I'll just add new asset groups into there and move that other one out.
Them: So you know how I created that segmentation in Product Hero? Where would I find that? Enlisting groups. Because you know how to, like, create it, like, level things, like product level free.
Me: It's on the custom label. Thread.
Them: Okay? But, like, if it's like a Diary Heroes Inside Kick segmentation that I've created in Product Hero, would that, like. And it's, like, named diaries.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Is that not meant to like?
Me: It doesn't look at the name. The actual segmentation is done in priority. So it would say, do diaries first. Look for heroes and psychics and diaries based upon what criteria you've set. And then at the end, there's a catch all that. If nothing has been set for custom label 3, use this criteria for these heroes and sidekicks, so it would filter through that way. So your heroes and psychics for diaries might be 200% target ROAS, but then your catch all one at the bottom might be 300%, but it'll only use that one if it's not already been set prior to that point. So in your asset groups for the diaries, If you wanted to break this down further using heroes and sidekicks, you'd use Custom Label 3.
Them: Do it from there.
Me: And there you can see the way in which the diaries are set up. So these are specific to diaries now, because of that hierarchical structure that you've got for this listing group that's saying how many heroes and psychics diaries you have.
Them: Okay? So then that would show. So that hero's group under diaries. Would split it out. The content criteria that I set in Product Hero.
Me: Yes.
Them: Okay?
Me: Yeah. Okay?
Them: Cool. So, yeah, that's all for Christmas. And then I. I noticed you put in the ad copy for the brand stationery. I saw that. So I know into, like, improved the ad copy for the other campaigns. I can work on that. I'll start with like UK and then move on to us. When? Book some time. And then I'm still working on negative SQLs as well. I've just been trying to sort out this incremental revenue. Today. And then.
Me: I appreciate you doing that, Lauren.
Them: Final thing is. Yeah. Your budget recommendations.
Me: Okay, let me share this.
Them: Yeah.
Me: We've got super complicated. It got super complicated because we were saying, with double counting on the UK for the purchase conversion action, the same was true for the US as well.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Which was also stopped back in April. So doing year on year comparisons have had to use the purchase conversion action to work out where there's been increases in conversion rate. So the first thing this is just to reiterate the budgets that have been agreed. So that's the total budget for November and the total budget for December. And what percentage of the budget each one of these the regions actually are going to use. So I've looked at an average here to find out what these percentages are. So again, just, it's just going to be indicative, but at least we can track the budgets per geographical location.
Them: Is this? Is budget open to, like being fluid, like, for example.
Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Them: If okay.
Me: Yeah, and that's what I mean. This really isn't me to be this precise, but I know the business needs this information to start off with, and just so long as just along the dot line at the bottom is correct.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, I don't, I don't think an extra 1 or 2% for each of these locations is going to make much difference to in the grand scheme of things, especially if we decide that we've got 5.7% for the rest of the world. If that went up to 8%, because we're going to get a higher roas, then it would be more of a pat on the back rather than why didn't you hit 5.7%? Okay, so this was the. Just out of interest, the conversion rate analysis for the US and the uk. For last year. Quite interesting. How. The US is lower. I mean, it's a lower point anyway because of the fact it's a UK company is shipping out to the us. But also, it wasn't as severe between October and November, the actual increase, and that's reflected really in the way we can play around with the roas. So. That's just a reflection of the difference between the two of them. So then looking at the conversion rates over the months. So this is just an explainer of the way in which I've worked out what the increases should be and when to spend the money, when to drop the target rise. So this is the story behind it. So the UK went from 4.54% to 5.74% in November, 5.95 in December. OK, so Pete was December. So we're seeing an uplift. Of q4 to q3 to q4. Of 31% last year for UK and 22% for the US. So that's the justification of playing around with budgets, playing around with target roas, because the indicators are that the conversion rate is going to go up in November and December and we're going to make some more money. Now you could say at the end of the day, and excuse my French. No, Sherlock, we're going to do better at Christmas. But at least it gives it a number to look at. And that increase has been used to work out when to drop the target. Roas. Ok, so you can see rest of the world. It's rubbish. That starts, it's not really telling us anything. But as I say, this is potentially an opportunity for us to try and get more out of rest of the world over the Christmas period, because there was Nothing back in December2024. For rest of world. Maybe it could have been last shipping dates. We're going to take that into consideration as well the rest of the world. I don't know when the cut off is likely to be for shipping and also for Europe. We will have to take that into consideration as to what we do with the budgets around about that time. Because if people aren't going to Christmas, I would suggest we drop the budgets. Around about that time. And increase the target roas.
Them: I think the management finance.
Me: That was a sage nod to that was Alex. This is a wise old.
Them: Yeah, we've got those. All those dates. Are pretty much confirmed because they won't have changed much of last year.
Me: Okay?
Them: But a bit a day or two difference.
Me: If you could ping them over, mate, that'd be great. It was in the G sheet or whatever that. I can plug those into this.
Them: Yeah, yeah. We'll do.
Me: Ok, so again, these are just explainers. On where the conversion rates are going to go. The key findings and then we've got the implementation timetable here. As to what we're going to do with the row, I think it was a better description further on. Where the heck is it? So I've not looked at this since a few days ago. We've got all the guardrails here as to. As to where we expect things to be at certain times as well. So we can see how it's actually what the trajectory of the strategy is going to be. There was a target, Roas.
Them: That.
Me: Explainer.
Them: Which. Is a bit about the weekly pallet date and weekly monitoring and validation protocol. It's just.
Me: Here we go. Here we go. So 29th to the 14th, we've got a 15% ROAS reduction. So that's from tomorrow. Yeah, it's from tomorrow. 15% for the UK. And that's the projected spend over the period.
Them: Very.
Me: Us just days. It is 10% reduction for Europe and standard for the rest of the world. Then from the 15th to the 30th. I'm saying Thanksgiving scaling. It's also Black Friday scaling as well.
Them: Good.
Me: We're maintaining that 15% for the UK. Dropping the US by 10%. Maintaining the European one and reducing rest of world by 10%. So then, versus the 15th of December, when we're on peak, we will be at 15% reduction. For most of them, apart from rest of world, which will be 10%. It's 10% because it was insufficient data, really, for the rest of the world to warrant it going any further than that. But we could potentially drop that further. And then carrying on with the reductions over all the way up to the 31st. We go into sales straight after Christmas.
Them: Thankful. Ly. I feel like you can find 24th, it'll be better.
Me: Right. So that will reduction will stay there.
Them: On.
Me: Until we get back into some level of normality. And before that point, I can work out what to do with the ROAS target then anyway, based upon the performance that there's been. So I think what I'll do is I will. I'm going to rejig this because to me, it makes sense. There's been a progression of this. I think the actual ROAS reductions and the budgeting is sound, but it's just a little bit unreadable. So what I'll do is I'll get it to consolidate this. As to the action plan for when to reduce roas, what budget to expect for each week, because no point in doing daily, we just do it per week so we can actually see how that's moving. And then we can compare the projected against what you have in your budget planner.
Them: The waiver.
Me: What it's telling you what your trajectory of your budget is.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it'll just make it a little bit more track. I'll simplify it.
Them: Yes, please.
Me: So that we could all understand. I think I was very mindful of the fact. I wanted to justify it. I didn't trust it. So when it says about the percentages, all the way along, I've gone through and checked them all just to make sure it's right, just to make sure they were. Actually those conversion rate reductions, because we don't want to be making these reductions when the conversion rate actually went up that week. So the key points really are from tomorrow to the 15th, the 15th to the 30th versus the 15th, and the 16th to the 31st. Those are our key periods. And the things that we're going to be discussing going forward as to whether we're actually hitting those points or not. Now, if we do hit those points, those were the revenue figures. Of where we expect to be on those budgets. So we're on a total Q4 revenue of 1.6. Yes. So that will include October as well. So revenue 819 for December and 8, 25 for November. Do you have it broken down to that level, Alex, or not?
Them: I've got the revenue target. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Country. And month, probably down to.
Me: And how are we with that? Does that. Does that match up with your expectations?
Them: Wait. Y. Eah.
Me: Ok, cool. That's the right answer. Good. Right. Which is great, because if you think the basis of this I've plugged in a budget. I plugged in an expectation and conversion rate and an expectation of revenue. What I did do is say, this is where we want to be and how are we going to do it? So it's actually come out from a different angle. So I'm pleased with that. Good. Nice one. Don't worry about these here. Then, Lauren at 4pM. That's what we're going to do.
Them: I can just look at the financial projections bit and then 15 rows reduction is that of course like all campaigned.
Me: So we say again.
Them: You've mentioned about like making a 15 rows reduction tomorrow. And so it's that, like. Across all campaigns, okay?
Me: Across. The board. Yeah.
Them: I'm not. And then usa says standard roas. So do you mean to, like, keep it as it is?
Me: Well, whatever the ROAS target is at the moment, we're just going to take 15% off it.
Them: Okay?
Me: But I say I'll clarify that in this if this isn't going to break it down by campaign, because the campaign's last year were completely different to this year. So we have to do it across the board and actually do some juggling that if one campaign is struggling and it's bringing a whole lot down, then we shift it back again.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So whilst this is literally just a framework going back to what you said before, this really isn't set in stone. This is just where we would like to be. But that's our skill in managing it. And making sure we actually are actually hitting those targets.
Them: Just looking for the. Sheet that Alex gave us last week with the projects. And like new shifted budgets. Give me a second. Scenario, or it'll be in the Digital Marketing Master.
Me: It was. On. Just. I think when I pulled it from now, because I know it was in the chat as well, wasn't it?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Oh, there we go.
Them: Cool. I'm just trying to look at like what all went on the self aware. Yeah, I've got the additional sprints. I'm just looking at what are.
Me: Have you got it? Ok?
Them: Threshold. So. 70.
Me: Can be really confusing.
Them: So.
Me: That they're not actually calendar months. Are they specific?
Them: Alex, am I correct in thinking about all Google adware should still be 6.02. That's still the target. I'm just looking in the digital marketing master in the paid search tab. Be better for that. It'd be probably better off looking in the additional spend. Shit. Okay? That's the latest view in there. So that has the new budget sitting there. Yeah. As your totals as well I should have. Cool. The bit where it says paid search, seasonal uplift, and it's got, like, the revenue. Is that just for. That's just for the additional. Right. Where are you looking? Sorry. So you've got Roys 7 to or 6 to 12 by month. And you've got total additional spend in budget plus additional. Yeah. So you've got that bit and the kind of, like, box next to it where it says you've got, like, spend revenue and then roas. So we're just looking at that bit because the new, like, box you've done from, I guess, like Colin's and R, it has the budget but not necessarily the revenue target. Because I'm just trying to figure out, like, what row. What's like. The standard, Ross, that we should be at at the moment. Well, yeah. So this has only got so to do that we have to add so that box you're looking at has any goal. What the additional spend needs to drive. Yeah. As in what the. Sorry, what the. The additional overall spend is so like the bits that say like 114k the budget in a plus additional space. So from m6 to. Yeah, r12. That's just budget, right? Yeah. I'm going to see if I've got another sheet which will show this clearer.
Me: Now, the average roas in, for instance, in the. For the uk. In q4 roas 2024 for the uk was 8.88. So we should smash those grass targets.
Them: You can use the paid search tab in the digital marketing sheet, but it just needs checking that they spend adds up. So for October, they're the same. They're both 140. I'll add in the November. Onward spends. Okay, and then that changes. So I can look at row row eight, right? As what our target for Google Ads is. Yeah, providing. All of those spend numbers. Reflect the latest bend of having want to produce that table. I've just updated them so order spends under total budget reflect what's in your additional spend. Scenario, the ones that you put in on Friday. Yeah. Yeah. So for my revenue point of view, it's the budget tracker numbers. Plus the additional budget number, additional revenue target, and then the spend is just the original Splend plus the additional spend. And that should add up on that sheet. Okay? I've only updated the spend for the section in like Navy. So I'll just. I'll just focus on that.
Me: I'm really sorry, guys. I'm going to jump off in a couple of minutes.
Them: No, that's. Everything can tend to 12. Hasn't changed. It's just the additional has changed, hasn't it? Yeah. So it's just making sure those additional numbers. Are what they are. In the new version. And if they are, then that should add up to the totals. Just going to update the shoulders. Normally. I think the original spend. Where your cursor is right now. Ok. No, that's fine. Ok? It's just loads of wealthy people that big. Mentor health institution. But just so we can probably do this budget stuff offline if needed. But are there any other bits we need to run through? No, I think we're ok.
Me: I'll simplify those numbers for you in the action plan. But I mean the principles there. The plan should work. Famous last words. And I am recording this. Ok, we said anything else, just give us a shout.
Them: Well do. Thanks, peter.
Me: Ok? I'll get that over to you today.
Them: Ok, thank you.
Me: All right. Cheers, guys.
Them: Js thank you.
