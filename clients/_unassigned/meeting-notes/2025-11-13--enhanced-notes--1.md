- -- Full Transcript ---
- 'Me: Oh, the Microsoft ads. Campaigns new ones.'
- 'Them: Peter.'
- 'Me: Hi. Just one sec. Oh, God. I''ve disappeared. Sorry.'
- 'Them: No. Worries.'
- 'Me: Teams. Teams. There we go. I''m back again. There we go. Do you have a nice
  long weekend?'
- 'Them: Thank you. I went to wooden.'
- 'Me: Oh, nice.'
- 'Them: Noise. Brings my friend? Yeah, I was meant to wedding in Manchester. My partner''s
  best friend.'
- 'Me: All right.'
- 'Them: So that was really nice.'
- 'Me: Lovely.'
- 'Them: So, yeah, we had lots of fun. It was like. Yeah, it was just a really nice
  weekend. It rained a little bit, but it was really, really nice.'
- 'Me: That''s enough for you.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: What about Sumanchester? Was it?'
- 'Them: So could. Well, I don''t know if this is exactly Manchester, but someone
  called Knutsford.'
- 'Me: Oh, no. So, susie. Then. Nice.'
- 'Them: Oh, yeah.'
- 'Me: Posh, Very poshy nuts.'
- 'Them: This is how you can tell I''m from down south? Because I don''t know what
  I''m talking about.'
- 'Me: It was just somewhere up north.'
- 'Them: Yes. But it was really nice.'
- 'Me: Nuts was beautiful. It''s really, really nice around there.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I used to ride my bike round there a fair bit. This tattoo parks around there
  as well. At least you weren''t actually in Manchester. It was a nice place where
  you were.'
- 'Them: We went to a restaurant in Manchester City center on Saturday night when
  we came down, but then after that, we were at the venue for most, for the most part.'
- 'Me: Right. Lovely.'
- 'Them: So. Yeah, it was really good. How about you? How was your weekend?'
- 'Me: Yeah, it was good. I did nothing. I say did nothing. We did less than we would
  normally do. It was just a chilling out weekend. We''d been out the weekend before
  and we''re going to the Lake District this coming weekend. So it was a recharge
  your batteries weekend. And plus the rugby was on as well, so I needed to watch
  that.'
- 'Them: When the next go see, it''s like my boyfriend, he''s in Manchester United
  fan. It''s like, when that''s on, everything else doesn''t exist, just football.'
- 'Me: Same here. Yeah. I must admit, I''m more rugby than football. I do like you
  know, I do support United. And I''ve been many times to watch. Not recently, but
  in the past. But I do. I prefer a game of rugby to football any day. Far better.
  Far back.'
- 'Them: Did you ever play?'
- 'Me: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I played at school and fell out of love with it. And
  then I went back when I was early 20s. Something like that and just got a bit too
  battered. I played for about three, four seasons, but it was, yeah. It was. It''s
  hard when you can''t actually get our bed on the Sunday morning after play, and
  you go, I shouldn''t really be doing this. Oh, it''s a great game. I think it helps
  if you''ve actually played, you know, to understand it. Otherwise it can be very
  complicated game, and it''s getting more and more complicated. As time goes on,
  they just add in new bits and pieces to it. It''s not like, kick the ball into that
  net there. I''ll tell you about offside, and don''t kick anybody in the legs. And
  that''s about it for football. I maybe oversimplified it.'
- 'Them: Football. Quite simple. Like, why is it so interesting? It''s literally just
  kicking around the ball.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.'
- 'Them: Yeah, Regarding work. Yeah, I know we''d like had a bit of a record for about
  the ad copy, and thank you for just covering my workload while I was away. Yeah.
  I had a look at your ad copy, and for the most part, it''s fine. It''s just like
  some of the headlines just need adjusting a little bit so I can do that.'
- 'Me: Okay? Whatever I say, I put it in. I put it in that format on the G sheet.
  So, you know, if you want to just ping it across to marketing, fine. If you see
  in there that you want me to bear in mind for the future when creating ad text,
  then just let me know and I can just add it. To the system, and I''ll make sure
  it doesn''t. It''s like the 137 years. I still think that''s a good line, but there
  you go.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It made me look a bit too precise. I''m gonna have to go back in every year
  to go and change it to the next year, but, you know. But yeah, if there''s anything.
  If you never want the word now in there, then just let me know, just. Even just
  in a text, and I. Can I. Can add it to the. To the system.'
- 'Them: What I can do is. Yeah, just create a list of, like, brand guidelines for
  you.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, that''d be great. Yeah.'
- 'Them: And that''s fine. On. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, we can say over 135 years or 137
  years. I just say over 135 just so that we''d have to change it every year.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: And yeah, so when I went the gift in ad set to asset groups last week, Monday,
  I''d like created ad copy for it.'
- 'Me: I didn''t really, like, done that because it, when I looked at it, the Christmas
  gifts for her wasn''t about Christmas gifts for her. It was a bit more genericy
  than, you know, gender related.'
- 'Them: And then. Yeah. And that''s fine. Like, it''s always good to get, like, feedback
  and improve things. So, like, thanks for that. And I think, like, what you''ve done
  is good. I''ll just make some tweaks to it and then, like, it can be implemented.
  If you be able to implement it. That would be great. And if you could just give
  me an edit access, then I can just make a few tweaks to it.'
- 'Me: Okay? Oh, sorry. Have I not done. Apologies.'
- 'Them: No view only. And then the translated copy.'
- 'Me: What was it called?'
- 'Them: I''ll ping every blink to you.'
- 'Me: Oh, I actually sent. I''d sent you a link. Hasn''t.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Lovely. Thank you.'
- 'Them: So, yeah, the copy that was in there before, I had given Luciana to give
  to the translation agency, because a translation. So what? EU and the rest of the
  world, we probably won''t be able to make any further tweaks for now, because it''s
  translated.'
- 'Me: I don''t really want. I definitely don''t want to.'
- 'Them: But. Yes. But as for US and uk, it''s a lot easier to make changes or update
  things, and so that''s fine. And then I. So I know, like, we''ve got a bit of a
  gap between what the business wants for revenue and what we could realistically
  achieve with what we''ve got. So last week, I, like, put together some ideas for.
  How we can kind of reject the app and shown Alex, I will share it with you as well.
  And that was like the things like putting more campaigns live on Bing, the brand
  lever accessories, stationary brand bags, and then the gifting and diaries campaigns
  for pmax and eu. With Bing. I know that you can import campaigns from Google. I
  just haven''t done it in a very long time. So I need to kind of.'
- 'Me: Specific ones. I mean, I know on your hand. I just didn''t have a time, Lauren.'
- 'Them: Find no worries.'
- 'Me: I think we need to sort of talk about my involvement in this and what it is.
  Don''t take this the wrong way. I''m not an assistant. And I''m not a permanent.
  I''m not a full time employee. At the end of the day, I''ve no, I have no problem
  doing this stuff.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve spent all my time doing the dashboard and doing. Sorting the strategy
  out so we can actually monitor it and try and help with the whole thing. But I''ve
  no, I have no problem doing this, the gifting stuff. It was, it was doing the asset
  groups, he''s doing the search themes, and it was doing the, the, the, the merchant
  center feed. So all that stuff needs doing for all those, the EU gifting, PMaxes
  and stuff. It''s just making sure that all those feeds are done, you know, so, yes,
  it''s a case of copying over the existing one, putting it into. Into merchant center
  and then then running it in. It all. It all just adds up. So it''s not as I''m just
  ignoring you, it''s just it''s having the actual time to do it. Last week was quite
  heavy on kind of the strategy thing? I don''t know. You looked at the strategy dashboard?
  I think it''s where we want it to be because it''s giving a day to day traffic light
  system. You know, if you look at it now, actual revenue, 164 grand. Expected revenue
  178 grand. So it''s using the pacing from last year. The revenue in the 50 odd percent
  of it of the revenue was brought in from 22nd November onwards. So I''ve applied
  that to this year as to what we can expect to happen. So I''m just, I''M trying
  to make things a bit more transparent for you. And, you know, so you can understand
  this, why the way the budgets goes? Because you could just look at it. We''re doing
  really well. Let''s just add a load of budget to it. Whereas really, we want to
  be keeping our powder dry for the 15th, really, is when it all kicks off so that
  we''ve got when that conversion rate starts to increase, then, you know, we''ve
  got enough budget to, to throw at it and maximize it. I had a really good call with,
  with Google yesterday. Just, just as an aside about. And they always say this about
  when Christmas is actually starting. And they''ll always talk about fake Friday,
  you know, the Friday before. But it''s definitely the 15th, when the conversion
  rate starts to increase. Definitely. And what we''re on.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And that''s what you''ve seen. Sorry. That''s what you''ve seen based
  on our account from, like, last year and how you created your.'
- 'Me: Yeah, well, from a lot of accounts. Yeah, a lot of accounts. I''m seeing that.
  And, like, we''re on the 11th now, you know? It''s tempting just to. Just to chuck
  all the money in now, but we''ll get more of a return from the 15th onwards in terms
  of conversion rates increasing, especially when we''re limited by the budget that
  we''ve got.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s fine. Alex had shown me, like, kind of, like how he had kind
  of split out the budget and, like, demand and stuff. And so it. He kind of put,
  like, 15% for, like, last week for team setup with budget, and then this week would
  be like 19, and then next week is 27%, and then the following week. Is like 39%
  of the budget. So it like kind of staggers and it is meant to be continue to increase.
  So I''d increase budgets on Friday. I''ve also increased some campaign budgets today,
  even though we''re not spending all of that money, like, so we are a bit behind
  on pacing. But this time, because hopefully we''ll catch up.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: After the 15th. Given that 15th is a Saturday, if there''s any change I need
  to make, that will need to be done on Friday.'
- 'Me: I do it on Friday. I do it the 14th. You think the 15th last year was probably
  the Friday.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. So that''s fine. And so that will be things like lowering the
  row as targets and increasing budgets. First one, just to continue your dashboard.
  So, yeah, we''ve got rose reduction. What do you mean by the rest of world campaign
  launch?'
- 'Me: I forget that it''s. There was some confusion over whether it was launched
  or not, so apologies for that. Forget that one.'
- 'Them: Okay? No worries. Cool. So, yeah, so on Friday, we''ll just be roast reductions.
  Even though you put uk. Do you? We. We should be reducing our votes across all of
  the accounts.'
- 'Me: No, not necessarily. The USA one was pretty much the week later.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: It was more delayed on the, on the, on the increase than it was for the, for
  the uk.'
- 'Them: We''re just like. Are all the campaigns in, like, for example, the UK meant
  to have the same target for us? Cuz they kind of, yeah, they all behave a bit differently.'
- 'Me: No. Yes, they do.'
- 'Them: So where.'
- 'Me: If you. I could help with that if you want. You know, if.'
- 'Them: I think it''s more just understanding, like, what the recommendation is here,
  because, like, it''s kind of like a general, like, 4.3 to 3.8. You vote all of the
  different campaigns in the UK account or in different places right now in terms
  of roas. So is it like.'
- 'Me: My, my, my suggestion would be that we, we''d kind of look at this in terms
  of what is happening at the moment and which campaigns are actually performing well.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And apply more of a target reduction to those. So if you''re looking at, you
  know, if it says it''s a 350 ROAS and it''s achieving 450, then that''s, that''s
  a good one. You know, that''s, that''s one we can reduce if it''s. Only just achieving
  the ROAS target. They''re maybe not do it. You know, just leave his illus for now
  and just. Just do this on a. On a dynamic thing. And it looks so precise, doesn''t
  it? Think I''ve got to absolutely hit that. It''s not. We''re over. We''re over
  indexing on roas at the moment anyway, which are nice place to be in, you know,
  if you reckon that the actual roas. I''m looking at the uk.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: Is 407. That''s above where it was expected to be. Europe is doing particularly
  well. In terms of roas. So, you know, it may be that we want to put more money towards
  them if they''re hitting a higher roas target. Sorry. A higher roas figure.'
- 'Them: That makes sense. Cool. And then, yeah, you mentioned about, like, your workload
  and stuff and. Yeah, I think if we just need to communicate about, like, what if
  you''ve got things to do, then I can, like, manage my expectations around that as
  well. I think last week was probably just very busy for both of us. And, yeah, I
  don''t know about you, but I ended up working late quite a lot last week. Yeah,
  just trying to figure out how we can, like, work together.'
- 'Me: Welcome to my world.'
- 'Them: So we could work together to get everything done. But I understand, like,
  you probably got, like, other clients work to get done as well. I know, like, you''re.
  You''re not my assistant, and I really respect your experience, and, like, there''s
  a lot to learn from you. When Alex said, yeah.'
- 'Me: Well, we got to do, though. We''ve got stuff to do. Yeah.'
- 'Them: When Alex said that you were coming back, he mentioned that you were coming
  back to support and. Yeah, helped me with the workload. So I think I''ve just been
  trying to figure out, like, how do I kind of, like, work with you? But I don''t
  want to be, like, micromanaging you either, because. You know what you''re doing,
  so. Yeah, it''s just, like, been trying to figure that out, really.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I know it''s not. I know it''s not easy, Lauren. I know. I don''t want
  to make it difficult for you. I''ve got a list of stuff to do there. On the gifting
  and diaries campaigns, for instance. I don''t necessarily agree with them. I don''t
  necessarily agree we should be launching at this stage of PMAX for France. But.
  If we''re going to launch it, let''s do it, like, in the next couple of days to
  make the most of it. The European ROAS is 607. Maybe there is more potential there,
  whether there''s potential for individual countries.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Remains to be seen. And I''m. I''m all. I''m also very conscious of. Making
  sure that we''re spending the money on the campaigns we already have that are producing.
  You know, not restricting them by budget. So it''d be interesting to see what we
  do with the spend on these.'
- 'Them: Exactly.'
- 'Me: But if we restricted too much, it''s not going to be worth doing them in the
  first place. So it''s difficult, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. I agree with, like having just like a one campaign for all of
  the European markets. But the only thing I was concerned about, yeah, that''s the
  thing, is the only way to separate it out and make sure that only the Germany''s
  people, German people see German language is by campaign, which is really annoying.'
- 'Me: What language? Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: So that''s the only reason I''d like said it that way.'
- 'Me: The french. Diaries. Pmax and italian diaries. Pmax. I just don''t know. I
  don''t know whether our time will be better. Not time, because it wouldn''t make
  any difference on time is actually putting having a German, French and Italian PMAX
  campaign with these as asset groups within there. Rather than doing separate campaigns
  for all of those, and bundled together, you bundled together the budget for France,
  the French PMAX campaign, the Italian PMAX campaign. If you look back on conversion,
  the conversion history on those, there''s not a lot of traffic goes through them.
  German one''s probably the best one.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And of course, the European one will be the one that is potentially going to
  do the best, because I presume that''s going to be in English. Targeting English
  speakers rather than the others are going to be in their particular languages. And
  the rest of the world are going to be in English, so they''re relatively straightforward
  to do. Apart from the merchants, then to feed. It''s just the individual language
  ones. If we can bundle them together in an individual PMAX campaign for that country.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And have asset groups of diaries and gifting within there and then post Christmas,
  if it''s doing really well on, say on the diaries, we can just pause the gifting
  one at that time.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Because that was my other idea. It was either
  separated mine into diary, have one diaries, one gift in, or put them in the same
  campaign. But then I was thinking, what if they perform differently? With diaries
  performed a lot better than gifting or vice versa. Should they be in the same campaign?'
- 'Me: I would suggest that don''t try and second guess it. Run it. And if they do,
  then move it out rather than presume that they''re going to do by and create separate
  campaigns.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Actually just chuck them all together. Chuck it all together in one country.
  If we find that the diaries or the gifting is crashing and burning, just pulls it,
  or move the other one out or whatever it might be. But do it on the do it on the
  stats rather than the presumption, I think is what I''M saying.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So the new structure will be Germany will have a
  campaign with diary and gifting asset group. French will have pmax with diaries
  and gifting, same for Italy and then rest of Europe will have diaries and gift in.
  And then you have rest of. Yeah. In English. And then rest of world will have a
  Peanuts coming with diaries and gifted cool.'
- 'Me: In english. Correct? Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that sounds good.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: When you do the feeds, is it okay if I. When you do it, could I, like, watch
  you do it? Just so I can, like. Yeah. Just want to continue learning about feeds
  and how you''re fit. Yeah. Really need to get better at.'
- 'Me: Well, the thing is, with those fees, they already exist, don''t they? The gifting
  ones are already there. So it''s just a case of putting it into merchant center.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay? This supplements were feed.'
- 'Me: Just using a different language and country. I can do it right now if you want.'
- 'Them: S modifier code again.'
- 'Me: Cool. I actually record every time now on these. It''s part of the new system.
  I''m just trying to capture everything. So I should really tell you at the beginning
  of the call, but.'
- 'Them: That is fine.'
- 'Me: It''s almost expected these days, isn''t it? Right, let me just. Share. Right,
  so we''re on merchant center data sources, Supplemental sources. So last update
  is. So when you do a Google sheet as your source. As in here.'
- 'Them: That''s the same one we were looking at last week, right?'
- 'Me: Yes, there were. So you can see we''ve got this one here, Custom Label Zero.
  And we''ve got custom label four. These are the ones we were doing last week. So
  custom label for is a gifts for him. Gifts for her label. So if we do this one here,
  gifts are him and her. We can see that that is us english. And this one here is
  uk english. So this will be for the UK account and this one will be for the US account.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Okay? Cool. And just to go over again, you created that sheet from
  AI. Just pull in the items from the page, from the gift page, and then matching
  it with the item IDs from the feed.'
- 'Me: Well, it''s more likely to be matching on a title in the feed rather than IDS
  because the ID is not surfaced on the web page. But, yes, that''s pretty much what
  it did. So I''m just going to open that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Now. Just so I know where that one is. So I''ve just taken it off to another
  page. Just checking for her, for him, for him. Okay? So. I''m going to just copy
  the name of this. And I''m going to add supplemental product data. I''m going to
  use Google sheets. Choose an existing sheets. Choose spreadsheet. And that''s the
  one there, because I''ve just opened it. There''s another reason for opening it.
  Goes to the top of the list when you. When you open it. Thinking about it. There
  we go. Says smart and custom label for gifs. Ok? Continue. So this is the bit where
  we want to specify which country it''s going to go to. So I''m going to do. Feed
  label of de for germany. Language is german. And the data. This is almost like a
  confirmation that you''ve selected the right thing. So this is when it says select
  primary data source, it''s going to attach itself to that data source. You know,
  the primary data source. The primary data source always been from Feed optimize.
  So there''s a feed optimized. German feed, and we''re going to attach it to it.
  So we''ll attach it to the products within this feed. So we click the box there.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Create data source.'
- 'Them: So essentially, it will match the item ID from your sheet and the item IDS
  from Feed Optimize. Okay, cool.'
- 'Me: Correct. Yeah. For germany. Now I''m going to just go in and to go into data
  source setup. It always puts a crappy name in there for the source name, so I''m
  just going to do that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So when we look at it in the supplemental feed, it''ll actually be correct.
  And then before you go away from it, do an it''s automatic. Set schedule. So then
  click on update. And it''s now running in. It won''t do it straight away, but if
  we go back to. The list of supplemental sources. Really annoying. Doesn''t put out
  at the top. We can see that one there. So I''ve done. I''ve sorted on last updated
  because this is. This is the one we just dragged in. So custom label 4 gives a him
  and her used in feed optimize the German so that now will now be associated with
  it. So what I do with the p. Max in the European account. It will be able to reference
  that custom label for in there when doing the listing groups. Yeah. So we can select
  on gifs for him or gifs for her. So the gifs for her, you select gifs of him. Sorry.
  Rewind when you select in the listing group for the PMAX campaign, if you''re doing
  an asset group of GIFs for her, you''re selecting GIFs for her custom label for.
  And it gives for him and her custom label for. Yeah, because it''s both of them.
  Because there are products that are associated with GIFs for him and her. So don''t
  exclude any. We don''t want to look at things that are just exclusively gifts for
  her. We want to look for stuff across the board. Ok, so I''ve done that for Germany
  and I''ll do that for Franc Italy.'
- 'Them: Okay? Cool. Yeah. Sorry.'
- 'Me: Europe.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: Not too sure how to do it for rest of the world. But I will. I''ll think of
  something. Ok, so I''ve called them the same thing here.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So we know where they''re from because it uses the same G sheet. It just changes
  that bit there, just to make sure it''s channeled through to the right. Through
  to the right country and language combination.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: So. On the custom label for those gifts for him, gift for her, and then gift
  for him and her.'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: And those remake. Oh, sorry.'
- 'Me: If I. If I go to the products now.'
- 'Them: Go on.'
- 'Me: And filter on country. And look for Germany. You can already see these are.
  These are just countries here. Germany. You can already see that some of these are
  populated. It''s quite quick doing it the slow bit. Is it coming from here into
  Google Ads? Give it about 20 minutes or something before it comes through. It depends
  on what the load is on their servers at the time, but it just takes a little while
  for it to come through. So you sometimes when you, if you do it too quickly, you''re
  going to Google Ads, create everything, go to your listing group. Oh, it''s not
  done. It. It''s. Because it''s just not populated yet. It''s not instant. It''s
  not instant coming in here, but that''s pretty quick. But yeah, she writes, you
  can see that it is. If I were to filter on label. It''s a good way to check to see
  what''s. What''s available in here. So we scroll down to Custom Label 4, you can
  see Githsahem gives for her Gisa him and her. Yeah. This is Sale one. There they
  just hangover. Essentially, what that means is it''s not set to any of the others,
  but they''re just hangovers from previous supplemental fees that have been done.'
- 'Them: And you know how on the sheet, the G sheet. There''s the item ID and custom
  label. 4. If you use the titles to pull items into that sheet, Where? At what point
  did the item IDs get there? That makes sense.'
- 'Me: The AI was looking at merchant center.'
- 'Them: Okay, so your AI is connected to the merchant, and you''ve asked. It''s essentially
  to add in the IDs for those. Yeah. Makes sense.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yes. Yeah. And you know what? At the end of the day, Lauren, it''s not
  an exact science, and we don''t necessarily want it to be. I don''t necessarily
  need it to be. It''d be nice if it was an exact science, but it''s not an exact
  science, but what we''ve got is now products which are likely to be gifts.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And we''re capturing everything else. In the other asset group. The heroes
  and psychics asset group. But these are effectively our gifts, and it means we can
  just stop this.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, the gifting part of it, which is the point I was making with the.
  With the asset groups. Your heroes and sidekicks in the main PMAX campaign isn''t
  about gifting. It''s your heroes and psychics. The message is about your heroes
  and psychics. If someone''s looking for a gift, they''re going to be triggered by
  the audience that you have set up for your asset group and the search themes that
  are in the asset group. So when they see one of these products, which may exist
  in the Heroes and Psychics, Asset group, the main one. But if they''re looking for
  gifts, they''re more likely to see that gifting message. It''s not correct if someone''s
  looking for a pen. To show them Christmas gift messaging.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: They''re looking for a pen. Yeah, that''s a simplistic way of looking at it,
  but that''s true. Now, the add text in the heroes and sidekicks has been left as
  it has got some Christmas gift messaging in there. But what we''re looking at is
  relevance all the way through. So the relevance in the heroes and psychics.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Asset group in the main PMAX campaign is all about stationary and about Smythes
  and about all the stuff that you do. So that''s going to attract the people who
  are looking for that kind of thing. They''re looking for a vague idea on stationery.
  If, for instance, we have a stationary asset group, which we do, they''re even more
  targeted on their search themes. Towards that. And they will get stuff even more
  targeted towards stationary as opposed to leather bags and accessories. So that''s
  how we''re channeling people now? What we were talking about the other week was
  about. Yes, but marketing, want, Christmas, messaging on everything. Well, I''m
  sure they do. And they''re going to get Christmas messaging on all the searches
  that are related to people looking for Christmas gifts. If someone wants a piece
  of paper. They don''t want an ad that says christmas gifts now available. Chris,
  that''s the wrong place. What we want to do is attract clicks, don''t we? We want
  to make that ad really relevant and the landing page really relevant. Don''t land
  them on a Christmas gift page if they were looking for stationery. Give them all
  the stationery.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.'
- 'Me: That was that huge email and sent you, that would be actively what that was.
  But I hope you were on board with that. Anyway, that was really the chunk of the
  work which you did on Friday was around Christmas gifting. And that''s what''s now
  going to roll forward to doing these in the other campaigns.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That all sounds good. Yeah, I had a read through the email and it all
  made sense, so that''s fine.'
- 'Me: Good.'
- 'Them: Cool. Apart from that, we''ve got Black Friday coming up next week. So, as
  you know, the campaign asset groups in PMAX will be paused and will have replacement
  Black Friday ones.'
- 'Me: I don''t agree with it. I really don''t.'
- 'Them: I know.'
- 'Me: I would say once again. And it''s Google best practice. I confirmed with Google
  we should be creating a Black Friday asset group in the same way as we do with Christmas,
  same as we do with gifting. And it''s targeting people for black looking for Black
  Friday deals. It''s not changing all the text in the main asset group or the majority
  of it is not to me is not correct and to Google is not correct.'
- 'Them: We''re not going to change. We''re not going to affect the existing ones.
  We''re going to duplicate of them and change the wording, the text and the imagery
  so that we''re pushing Black Friday. But the asset groups that already exist, they''re
  just going to be paused.'
- 'Me: Could you just excuse me one second? Sorry. Here we go.'
- 'Them: Yeah, no worries.'
- 'Me: It''s this time. It''s 11:30. That''s what does it. That''s when the deliveries
  arrive.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Sorry.'
- 'Them: No worries. So, yeah, we''ll have essentially, like. Twins. Of what? It really
  exists. But they''re just going to be Black Friday twins.'
- 'Me: That''s fine, but don''t pause the existing asset group.'
- 'Them: What we need.'
- 'Me: That was the purpose of the piece on the best practices. All of a sudden you''re
  pausing it and then starting it. After Black Friday, it''s going, oh, right, where
  are we, then? Right, let''s get going again. And it just interrupts that algorithm
  massively. So, yes, you might do well on Black Friday.'
- 'Them: To.'
- 'Me: But when it''s after Black Friday, that asset group has to start not all over
  again, but it has to restart the algorithm and you jeopardizing the future revenue.'
- 'Them: Do.'
- 'Me: And profit profitability of that asset group. Which.'
- 'Them: I understand. And I get what you mean. Like I. I do get it. It''s just that
  the business wants to push Black Friday. And then slowly.'
- 'Me: Yeah, they will do. If you duplicate that campaign, if you duplicate that asset
  group and you''re absolutely clear on your search themes and your audience selection,
  it''s people looking for bargains, then you will be pushing Black Friday. You could
  even change the image assets within.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We''re going to have other image assets as well. It''s
  just going to be like a Black Friday graphic.'
- 'Me: Yeah. But just don''t stop that asset group. Categorically don''t stop that
  asset group. If you were to speak to Google, they would definitely. Do not do that.
  You got to leave it running.'
- 'Them: Stan. It''s just that if we leave it running, it could absorb more of the
  budget and.'
- 'Me: Great. Well, it all converts as well. If it''s people looking for pens and
  not Black Friday, fantastic.'
- 'Them: So my thing was like, why not combine both the people who are looking for
  pens during Black Friday. Those. But if we talk in the asset group targeting, it
  will still be the same targeting. So leave it as it is in terms of like, pens or
  whatever they''re looking for. But the imagery and the messaging has changed the
  Black Friday. So when they do see that payment they''re looking for, they know.
  Oh, okay. I want this pen. But it''s also on Black Friday. I was also going to speak
  about putting promotions on Merchant center, but I come to that in a minute. But,
  yeah, essentially, they''ll still be looking for a pen. But they know it''s on Black
  Friday. If we. If we had to complete a message at the same time, they may not be
  aware that it''s Black Friday. Whereas we''ve got other competitors who are completely
  pushing Black Friday, and I think that''s where Alex and Seb are coming from. But,
  like. We just need to push Black Friday because that''s when.'
- 'Me: In which case change some of the text on existing asset group, don''t create
  a new asset group and pause existing one. The pause in the existing asset group
  is suicide. Seriously. It''s going to seriously affect the revenue. If you do do
  that.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: That''s my advice. That''s my advice, and that''s based upon the research I''ve
  done about this on Google.'
- 'Them: I understand what you mean. Like, it''s like when we reactivate them, the.
  It''s the system going to have to reboot and all the kind of stuff, and it''s going
  to go back to learning. I get that.'
- 'Me: It wouldn''t go back to learning. But it will be impacted by it. And I think
  if you want the best of both worlds, I would just add some Black Friday text into
  the existing asset group.'
- 'Them: But. I think I''m just going to create a new asset groups because I wanted
  to just go live as soon as possible on Monday. Rather than having to like change
  around tax and then change it back again in two weeks time.'
- 'Me: You''re going live on Monday.'
- 'Them: Yeah. It''s for two weeks from the 17th. Till the second.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: So I''m just going to put my foot. My teams on do not disturb because lots
  of messages going around. But, yeah, they don''t want to. They don''t want to. Conflicting
  messages at the same time, they want to push Black Friday.'
- 'Me: It won''t be a conflicting message. Either get one or the other one.'
- 'Them: And. Yeah. But. But they don''t want the other one at all. Like we don''t
  want to be seeing any Christmas. Assets. In the Black Friday asset group, there''s
  going to be some text that says, like, smyrn pens or smarting luxury pens. Anyway,
  so I think it will be okay.'
- 'Me: No, I disagree. I couldn''t disagree more about the strategy.'
- 'Them: As for like, when we reactivate like, do you have an idea of, like, how much
  you think it will affect revenue? Like.'
- 'Me: I don''t know whether I sent that over to whether it was. I mean, I couldn''t
  give you a number. I mean, if I gave you a number, you wouldn''t believe me anyway.
  As in, I wouldn''t believe anyone who said, I can give you an actual number for
  it.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: But.'
- 'Them: Because that''s the main thing, like, Is. It is pausing. These are. It''s
  going to affect our performance that like a lot.'
- 'Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. The asset groups will pause in. The asset groups will
  make a difference.'
- 'Them: It''s like, how much of a difference?'
- 'Me: See Google''s official recommendation Add new asset groups for holiday created
  within existing campaigns. Layer promotional messaging onto current structure. And
  that was only created a separate campaign. You got different budgets and targets.
  Google warns that pausing and unpausing asset groups disrupts the algorithms learning.
  Real world experience shows that campaigns struggle to recover pre holiday performance
  after seasonal asset group support.'
- 'Them: You send that to me, didn''t you? In the chat?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, well, I''ll talk that Alexa about it again, but at the moment, this
  is what we want to do, and this is what we''re doing.'
- 'Me: It''s just been blindfolded by this. I understand you want to put Black Friday
  messaging out there, and it will put Black Friday messaging out to the right people,
  but it''s actually to the detriment of the performance of the Christmas campaigns.
  If someone''s looking for if someone''s looking for a Christmas gift. They want
  a Christmas message.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: They don''t necessarily need a Black Friday one you can put. You can do a promotional
  extension on the search ads. For this because let''s face it, at the end of the
  day, most of this is going to be in shopping ads, not in search. So you might have
  90% of the spend. I''m making this up. But it''s a large percentage of the spend
  is going to go towards shopping ads which won''t have that messaging on anyway.
  And then see you jeopardizing the whole of that 90% spend after it''s reactivated.
  By that 10% of ads, which will be search ads. Of which a lot of them will see the
  Black Friday messaging anyway. If we put some headlines in there that reflect Black
  Friday and put promotional extension on for Black Friday. I do. I think it''s more
  a case of the business understanding. Exactly. What this means by having a separate
  Black Friday campaign, they''re dictating the structure of the campaigns, not understanding
  the technicalities behind it.'
- 'Them: But they want to do what they what we did last year, which was to help Black
  Friday attributes. I suggested two options. We do what we did last year, which is
  the separate Black Friday asset Group. Or we use what we have already used, product
  images for products, and then have Black Friday text, so you''ll still get in both.
  But they just want everything to put feedback Friday, and that''s what they''re
  comfortable with. That''s what Alex wants to go forward with, so.'
- 'Me: Well, that''s my recommendation, then.'
- 'Them: Yeah, all right. I understand what you mean.'
- 'Me: If that''s what I''m battling against, then I want to just make it noted. I
  totally disagree with that. I understand what the business wants, but I think as
  I say, most of the spend is going to go on shopping ads anyway and you''ll suddenly
  pausing your best asset group and starting a new one.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And I just disagree with that. It may have happened last year, but was it successful?
  Don''t know.'
- 'Them: And they drove. The things were double counting anyway, so we can''t really.'
- 'Me: I know. I''ll do some research if you want me to do some research, and I''ll
  do some research on it if we can put some numbers behind it.'
- 'Them: Say. If we want to. If you got, like, a spare moment after we''ve dealt with
  everything else. But, yeah, that''s what we want to do. Also in cold. I was going
  to say about motions. Okay. So we''ll come back to me. But as for Merchant Center.
  Yeah. So we want to put promotions on our shopping ad. So I think there''s, like,
  a promo feature you can use in Merchant center, so we need to set that up.'
- 'Me: There is. If there''s specific drops in prices on specific products, then you
  could do a promotional feed.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So it''s level sensitive, it''s level goods. Like home accessories
  etc.'
- 'Me: It would need a list of skews.'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: Product ideas.'
- 'Them: I think I''ve got that. Just give me a second. I feel this Black Friday thing
  is something we''d have to test, but it''s like there''s no time to test it. Choose
  something. Just go with me a moment.'
- 'Me: I don''t think you want to see this my screen anymore. So I''ve just realized
  I''m still sharing that.'
- 'Them: Right, so it''s Leverin. Books, notebooks. Full price product offered at
  30 or 20% off. I don''t know which one that is. Like, what''s 20 or what''s 30%?
  But yeah.'
- 'Me: So in order to set the feed up, we need to know what the products are and what
  the actual offer is. Specifically what the offer is.'
- 'Them: Have a list and it''s got barcodes. Use.'
- 'Me: Just the product id that''s all that''s needed.'
- 'Them: Okay. Books are 20% off. Lever is 30% off. No diaries. Product exclusions
  or diaries. Let me share my screen. Diaries, stationery, writing instruments and
  refills. I miss you. As well. But yeah. So Libra is 30% off. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Is that article the product id?'
- 'Them: I don''t think. I. Would have been much incentive to back up. Just looking
  for the old product to do.'
- 'Me: I would have picked the German one. Flight car? Yes, it is the product id.'
- 'Them: Sorry. What''s that? Add article.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So if I share this sheet of you. I mean, I don''t know. What is it something
  you''ll do like your AI to.'
- 'Me: It''s just promotional. Promotional product fee going in. So it had the actual
  offer in there, didn''t it?'
- 'Them: Respond. So all of these products in this list are lever 30% or they''ll
  go into a feed.'
- 'Me: On the 17th. Right. It''s going to take a bit of processing, though. I''ll
  have to disseminate the actual. Which I''ll have to create a number of different
  promotions. First. Which are 30% off and whatever else is on that list. And then
  set up the feed so it matches those. All right, so we got the two of them. So it''s
  two promotions, and then put the relevant products against each promotion.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: I haven''t done it before, but I would like to learn. So. Yeah, but if you
  want to do it because you have more experience with it, that''s fine. If I can watch
  you do it, that would be great. Second Then.'
- 'Me: It''s not a five minute job that Aaron.'
- 'Them: That''s fine.'
- 'Me: Ok, yeah, ping that over and I''ll. I''ll set something up.'
- 'Them: Okay? I will send that a little. What I''ll do is just. I''ll just reconfirm
  the email. What? We''re doing and send that over as well. And then I was going to
  put countdown customizers on the search ads as well. But I just need to, like, show
  Alex what that''s going to look like. So it''s like, final bit and then we''ll have
  like cross site links, call outs, stretch snippets, etc. So yeah. But. About? It.
  I will also send you that peak pen, which just covers, like, the Christmas extra
  campaigns that we''re creating, and then the Black Friday stuff.'
- 'Me: Right, well, I''m gonna. I''m gonna work on this. Email the handover document
  he sent over last week.'
- 'Them: Okay, that''s fine. I have some reporting to do today because for a meeting
  just to cover, like, the last period. P7. So that''s for tomorrow, and then I can
  do the Bing campaigns.'
- 'Me: Ok?'
- 'Them: Yeah. That''s fine. And then I''m just going to have a little marketing on
  what''s happening with the Black Friday visuals and stuff like that. But yeah.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve got those translations then for the French, German, Italian.'
- 'Them: Thanks. Yeah, it''s for gifting and diaries.'
- 'Me: Ok, cool. And I''ll get the feeds in and do the merchant center promotion,
  ok?'
- 'Them: Cool. And I will adjust your gift in that copy as well. Just a neat little
  tweaks. Cool. Thank you so much.'
- 'Me: Oh. So, yes. And if you could do some a steer on future brand guidelines and
  stuff. That''d be lovely.'
- 'Them: No problem.'
- 'Me: Make it easy in the future, wouldn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Oh, thanks, peter.'
- 'Me: Okie dokie.'
- 'Them: We could say.'
- 'Me: Have a good one. Bye.'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Me: Oh, the Microsoft ads. Campaigns new ones.
- Them: Peter.
- Me: Hi. Just one sec. Oh, God. I've disappeared. Sorry.
- Them: No. Worries.
- Me: Teams. Teams. There we go. I'm back again. There we go. Do you have a nice long weekend?
- Them: Thank you. I went to wooden.
- Me: Oh, nice.
- Them: Noise. Brings my friend? Yeah, I was meant to wedding in Manchester. My partner's best friend.
- Me: All right.
- Them: So that was really nice.
- Me: Lovely.
- Them: So, yeah, we had lots of fun. It was like. Yeah, it was just a really nice weekend. It rained a little bit, but it was really, really nice.
- Me: That's enough for you.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: What about Sumanchester? Was it?
- Them: So could. Well, I don't know if this is exactly Manchester, but someone called Knutsford.
- Me: Oh, no. So, susie. Then. Nice.
- Them: Oh, yeah.
- Me: Posh, Very poshy nuts.
- Them: This is how you can tell I'm from down south? Because I don't know what I'm talking about.
- Me: It was just somewhere up north.
- Them: Yes. But it was really nice.
- Me: Nuts was beautiful. It's really, really nice around there.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I used to ride my bike round there a fair bit. This tattoo parks around there as well. At least you weren't actually in Manchester. It was a nice place where you were.
- Them: We went to a restaurant in Manchester City center on Saturday night when we came down, but then after that, we were at the venue for most, for the most part.
- Me: Right. Lovely.
- Them: So. Yeah, it was really good. How about you? How was your weekend?
- Me: Yeah, it was good. I did nothing. I say did nothing. We did less than we would normally do. It was just a chilling out weekend. We'd been out the weekend before and we're going to the Lake District this coming weekend. So it was a recharge your batteries weekend. And plus the rugby was on as well, so I needed to watch that.
- Them: When the next go see, it's like my boyfriend, he's in Manchester United fan. It's like, when that's on, everything else doesn't exist, just football.
- Me: Same here. Yeah. I must admit, I'm more rugby than football. I do like you know, I do support United. And I've been many times to watch. Not recently, but in the past. But I do. I prefer a game of rugby to football any day. Far better. Far back.
- Them: Did you ever play?
- Me: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I played at school and fell out of love with it. And then I went back when I was early 20s. Something like that and just got a bit too battered. I played for about three, four seasons, but it was, yeah. It was. It's hard when you can't actually get our bed on the Sunday morning after play, and you go, I shouldn't really be doing this. Oh, it's a great game. I think it helps if you've actually played, you know, to understand it. Otherwise it can be very complicated game, and it's getting more and more complicated. As time goes on, they just add in new bits and pieces to it. It's not like, kick the ball into that net there. I'll tell you about offside, and don't kick anybody in the legs. And that's about it for football. I maybe oversimplified it.
- Them: Football. Quite simple. Like, why is it so interesting? It's literally just kicking around the ball.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
- Them: Yeah, Regarding work. Yeah, I know we'd like had a bit of a record for about the ad copy, and thank you for just covering my workload while I was away. Yeah. I had a look at your ad copy, and for the most part, it's fine. It's just like some of the headlines just need adjusting a little bit so I can do that.
- Me: Okay? Whatever I say, I put it in. I put it in that format on the G sheet. So, you know, if you want to just ping it across to marketing, fine. If you see in there that you want me to bear in mind for the future when creating ad text, then just let me know and I can just add it. To the system, and I'll make sure it doesn't. It's like the 137 years. I still think that's a good line, but there you go.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It made me look a bit too precise. I'm gonna have to go back in every year to go and change it to the next year, but, you know. But yeah, if there's anything. If you never want the word now in there, then just let me know, just. Even just in a text, and I. Can I. Can add it to the. To the system.
- Them: What I can do is. Yeah, just create a list of, like, brand guidelines for you.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.
- Them: And that's fine. On. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, we can say over 135 years or 137 years. I just say over 135 just so that we'd have to change it every year.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: And yeah, so when I went the gift in ad set to asset groups last week, Monday, I'd like created ad copy for it.
- Me: I didn't really, like, done that because it, when I looked at it, the Christmas gifts for her wasn't about Christmas gifts for her. It was a bit more genericy than, you know, gender related.
- Them: And then. Yeah. And that's fine. Like, it's always good to get, like, feedback and improve things. So, like, thanks for that. And I think, like, what you've done is good. I'll just make some tweaks to it and then, like, it can be implemented. If you be able to implement it. That would be great. And if you could just give me an edit access, then I can just make a few tweaks to it.
- Me: Okay? Oh, sorry. Have I not done. Apologies.
- Them: No view only. And then the translated copy.
- Me: What was it called?
- Them: I'll ping every blink to you.
- Me: Oh, I actually sent. I'd sent you a link. Hasn't.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Lovely. Thank you.
- Them: So, yeah, the copy that was in there before, I had given Luciana to give to the translation agency, because a translation. So what? EU and the rest of the world, we probably won't be able to make any further tweaks for now, because it's translated.
- Me: I don't really want. I definitely don't want to.
- Them: But. Yes. But as for US and uk, it's a lot easier to make changes or update things, and so that's fine. And then I. So I know, like, we've got a bit of a gap between what the business wants for revenue and what we could realistically achieve with what we've got. So last week, I, like, put together some ideas for. How we can kind of reject the app and shown Alex, I will share it with you as well. And that was like the things like putting more campaigns live on Bing, the brand lever accessories, stationary brand bags, and then the gifting and diaries campaigns for pmax and eu. With Bing. I know that you can import campaigns from Google. I just haven't done it in a very long time. So I need to kind of.
- Me: Specific ones. I mean, I know on your hand. I just didn't have a time, Lauren.
- Them: Find no worries.
- Me: I think we need to sort of talk about my involvement in this and what it is. Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not an assistant. And I'm not a permanent. I'm not a full time employee. At the end of the day, I've no, I have no problem doing this stuff.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I've spent all my time doing the dashboard and doing. Sorting the strategy out so we can actually monitor it and try and help with the whole thing. But I've no, I have no problem doing this, the gifting stuff. It was, it was doing the asset groups, he's doing the search themes, and it was doing the, the, the, the merchant center feed. So all that stuff needs doing for all those, the EU gifting, PMaxes and stuff. It's just making sure that all those feeds are done, you know, so, yes, it's a case of copying over the existing one, putting it into. Into merchant center and then then running it in. It all. It all just adds up. So it's not as I'm just ignoring you, it's just it's having the actual time to do it. Last week was quite heavy on kind of the strategy thing? I don't know. You looked at the strategy dashboard? I think it's where we want it to be because it's giving a day to day traffic light system. You know, if you look at it now, actual revenue, 164 grand. Expected revenue 178 grand. So it's using the pacing from last year. The revenue in the 50 odd percent of it of the revenue was brought in from 22nd November onwards. So I've applied that to this year as to what we can expect to happen. So I'm just, I'M trying to make things a bit more transparent for you. And, you know, so you can understand this, why the way the budgets goes? Because you could just look at it. We're doing really well. Let's just add a load of budget to it. Whereas really, we want to be keeping our powder dry for the 15th, really, is when it all kicks off so that we've got when that conversion rate starts to increase, then, you know, we've got enough budget to, to throw at it and maximize it. I had a really good call with, with Google yesterday. Just, just as an aside about. And they always say this about when Christmas is actually starting. And they'll always talk about fake Friday, you know, the Friday before. But it's definitely the 15th, when the conversion rate starts to increase. Definitely. And what we're on.
- Them: Yeah. And that's what you've seen. Sorry. That's what you've seen based on our account from, like, last year and how you created your.
- Me: Yeah, well, from a lot of accounts. Yeah, a lot of accounts. I'm seeing that. And, like, we're on the 11th now, you know? It's tempting just to. Just to chuck all the money in now, but we'll get more of a return from the 15th onwards in terms of conversion rates increasing, especially when we're limited by the budget that we've got.
- Them: Yeah, that's fine. Alex had shown me, like, kind of, like how he had kind of split out the budget and, like, demand and stuff. And so it. He kind of put, like, 15% for, like, last week for team setup with budget, and then this week would be like 19, and then next week is 27%, and then the following week. Is like 39% of the budget. So it like kind of staggers and it is meant to be continue to increase. So I'd increase budgets on Friday. I've also increased some campaign budgets today, even though we're not spending all of that money, like, so we are a bit behind on pacing. But this time, because hopefully we'll catch up.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: After the 15th. Given that 15th is a Saturday, if there's any change I need to make, that will need to be done on Friday.
- Me: I do it on Friday. I do it the 14th. You think the 15th last year was probably the Friday.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. So that's fine. And so that will be things like lowering the row as targets and increasing budgets. First one, just to continue your dashboard. So, yeah, we've got rose reduction. What do you mean by the rest of world campaign launch?
- Me: I forget that it's. There was some confusion over whether it was launched or not, so apologies for that. Forget that one.
- Them: Okay? No worries. Cool. So, yeah, so on Friday, we'll just be roast reductions. Even though you put uk. Do you? We. We should be reducing our votes across all of the accounts.
- Me: No, not necessarily. The USA one was pretty much the week later.
- Them: So.
- Me: It was more delayed on the, on the, on the increase than it was for the, for the uk.
- Them: We're just like. Are all the campaigns in, like, for example, the UK meant to have the same target for us? Cuz they kind of, yeah, they all behave a bit differently.
- Me: No. Yes, they do.
- Them: So where.
- Me: If you. I could help with that if you want. You know, if.
- Them: I think it's more just understanding, like, what the recommendation is here, because, like, it's kind of like a general, like, 4.3 to 3.8. You vote all of the different campaigns in the UK account or in different places right now in terms of roas. So is it like.
- Me: My, my, my suggestion would be that we, we'd kind of look at this in terms of what is happening at the moment and which campaigns are actually performing well.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And apply more of a target reduction to those. So if you're looking at, you know, if it says it's a 350 ROAS and it's achieving 450, then that's, that's a good one. You know, that's, that's one we can reduce if it's. Only just achieving the ROAS target. They're maybe not do it. You know, just leave his illus for now and just. Just do this on a. On a dynamic thing. And it looks so precise, doesn't it? Think I've got to absolutely hit that. It's not. We're over. We're over indexing on roas at the moment anyway, which are nice place to be in, you know, if you reckon that the actual roas. I'm looking at the uk.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
- Me: Is 407. That's above where it was expected to be. Europe is doing particularly well. In terms of roas. So, you know, it may be that we want to put more money towards them if they're hitting a higher roas target. Sorry. A higher roas figure.
- Them: That makes sense. Cool. And then, yeah, you mentioned about, like, your workload and stuff and. Yeah, I think if we just need to communicate about, like, what if you've got things to do, then I can, like, manage my expectations around that as well. I think last week was probably just very busy for both of us. And, yeah, I don't know about you, but I ended up working late quite a lot last week. Yeah, just trying to figure out how we can, like, work together.
- Me: Welcome to my world.
- Them: So we could work together to get everything done. But I understand, like, you probably got, like, other clients work to get done as well. I know, like, you're. You're not my assistant, and I really respect your experience, and, like, there's a lot to learn from you. When Alex said, yeah.
- Me: Well, we got to do, though. We've got stuff to do. Yeah.
- Them: When Alex said that you were coming back, he mentioned that you were coming back to support and. Yeah, helped me with the workload. So I think I've just been trying to figure out, like, how do I kind of, like, work with you? But I don't want to be, like, micromanaging you either, because. You know what you're doing, so. Yeah, it's just, like, been trying to figure that out, really.
- Me: Yeah. I know it's not. I know it's not easy, Lauren. I know. I don't want to make it difficult for you. I've got a list of stuff to do there. On the gifting and diaries campaigns, for instance. I don't necessarily agree with them. I don't necessarily agree we should be launching at this stage of PMAX for France. But. If we're going to launch it, let's do it, like, in the next couple of days to make the most of it. The European ROAS is 607. Maybe there is more potential there, whether there's potential for individual countries.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Remains to be seen. And I'm. I'm all. I'm also very conscious of. Making sure that we're spending the money on the campaigns we already have that are producing. You know, not restricting them by budget. So it'd be interesting to see what we do with the spend on these.
- Them: Exactly.
- Me: But if we restricted too much, it's not going to be worth doing them in the first place. So it's difficult, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. I agree with, like having just like a one campaign for all of the European markets. But the only thing I was concerned about, yeah, that's the thing, is the only way to separate it out and make sure that only the Germany's people, German people see German language is by campaign, which is really annoying.
- Me: What language? Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah, yeah.
- Them: So that's the only reason I'd like said it that way.
- Me: The french. Diaries. Pmax and italian diaries. Pmax. I just don't know. I don't know whether our time will be better. Not time, because it wouldn't make any difference on time is actually putting having a German, French and Italian PMAX campaign with these as asset groups within there. Rather than doing separate campaigns for all of those, and bundled together, you bundled together the budget for France, the French PMAX campaign, the Italian PMAX campaign. If you look back on conversion, the conversion history on those, there's not a lot of traffic goes through them. German one's probably the best one.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And of course, the European one will be the one that is potentially going to do the best, because I presume that's going to be in English. Targeting English speakers rather than the others are going to be in their particular languages. And the rest of the world are going to be in English, so they're relatively straightforward to do. Apart from the merchants, then to feed. It's just the individual language ones. If we can bundle them together in an individual PMAX campaign for that country.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And have asset groups of diaries and gifting within there and then post Christmas, if it's doing really well on, say on the diaries, we can just pause the gifting one at that time.
- Them: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Because that was my other idea. It was either separated mine into diary, have one diaries, one gift in, or put them in the same campaign. But then I was thinking, what if they perform differently? With diaries performed a lot better than gifting or vice versa. Should they be in the same campaign?
- Me: I would suggest that don't try and second guess it. Run it. And if they do, then move it out rather than presume that they're going to do by and create separate campaigns.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Actually just chuck them all together. Chuck it all together in one country. If we find that the diaries or the gifting is crashing and burning, just pulls it, or move the other one out or whatever it might be. But do it on the do it on the stats rather than the presumption, I think is what I'M saying.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So the new structure will be Germany will have a campaign with diary and gifting asset group. French will have pmax with diaries and gifting, same for Italy and then rest of Europe will have diaries and gift in. And then you have rest of. Yeah. In English. And then rest of world will have a Peanuts coming with diaries and gifted cool.
- Me: In english. Correct? Yeah.
- Them: Yeah, that sounds good.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: When you do the feeds, is it okay if I. When you do it, could I, like, watch you do it? Just so I can, like. Yeah. Just want to continue learning about feeds and how you're fit. Yeah. Really need to get better at.
- Me: Well, the thing is, with those fees, they already exist, don't they? The gifting ones are already there. So it's just a case of putting it into merchant center.
- Them: Yeah. Okay? This supplements were feed.
- Me: Just using a different language and country. I can do it right now if you want.
- Them: S modifier code again.
- Me: Cool. I actually record every time now on these. It's part of the new system. I'm just trying to capture everything. So I should really tell you at the beginning of the call, but.
- Them: That is fine.
- Me: It's almost expected these days, isn't it? Right, let me just. Share. Right, so we're on merchant center data sources, Supplemental sources. So last update is. So when you do a Google sheet as your source. As in here.
- Them: That's the same one we were looking at last week, right?
- Me: Yes, there were. So you can see we've got this one here, Custom Label Zero. And we've got custom label four. These are the ones we were doing last week. So custom label for is a gifts for him. Gifts for her label. So if we do this one here, gifts are him and her. We can see that that is us english. And this one here is uk english. So this will be for the UK account and this one will be for the US account.
- Them: Y. Eah. Okay? Cool. And just to go over again, you created that sheet from AI. Just pull in the items from the page, from the gift page, and then matching it with the item IDs from the feed.
- Me: Well, it's more likely to be matching on a title in the feed rather than IDS because the ID is not surfaced on the web page. But, yes, that's pretty much what it did. So I'm just going to open that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Now. Just so I know where that one is. So I've just taken it off to another page. Just checking for her, for him, for him. Okay? So. I'm going to just copy the name of this. And I'm going to add supplemental product data. I'm going to use Google sheets. Choose an existing sheets. Choose spreadsheet. And that's the one there, because I've just opened it. There's another reason for opening it. Goes to the top of the list when you. When you open it. Thinking about it. There we go. Says smart and custom label for gifs. Ok? Continue. So this is the bit where we want to specify which country it's going to go to. So I'm going to do. Feed label of de for germany. Language is german. And the data. This is almost like a confirmation that you've selected the right thing. So this is when it says select primary data source, it's going to attach itself to that data source. You know, the primary data source. The primary data source always been from Feed optimize. So there's a feed optimized. German feed, and we're going to attach it to it. So we'll attach it to the products within this feed. So we click the box there.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Create data source.
- Them: So essentially, it will match the item ID from your sheet and the item IDS from Feed Optimize. Okay, cool.
- Me: Correct. Yeah. For germany. Now I'm going to just go in and to go into data source setup. It always puts a crappy name in there for the source name, so I'm just going to do that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So when we look at it in the supplemental feed, it'll actually be correct. And then before you go away from it, do an it's automatic. Set schedule. So then click on update. And it's now running in. It won't do it straight away, but if we go back to. The list of supplemental sources. Really annoying. Doesn't put out at the top. We can see that one there. So I've done. I've sorted on last updated because this is. This is the one we just dragged in. So custom label 4 gives a him and her used in feed optimize the German so that now will now be associated with it. So what I do with the p. Max in the European account. It will be able to reference that custom label for in there when doing the listing groups. Yeah. So we can select on gifs for him or gifs for her. So the gifs for her, you select gifs of him. Sorry. Rewind when you select in the listing group for the PMAX campaign, if you're doing an asset group of GIFs for her, you're selecting GIFs for her custom label for. And it gives for him and her custom label for. Yeah, because it's both of them. Because there are products that are associated with GIFs for him and her. So don't exclude any. We don't want to look at things that are just exclusively gifts for her. We want to look for stuff across the board. Ok, so I've done that for Germany and I'll do that for Franc Italy.
- Them: Okay? Cool. Yeah. Sorry.
- Me: Europe.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: Not too sure how to do it for rest of the world. But I will. I'll think of something. Ok, so I've called them the same thing here.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So we know where they're from because it uses the same G sheet. It just changes that bit there, just to make sure it's channeled through to the right. Through to the right country and language combination.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: So. On the custom label for those gifts for him, gift for her, and then gift for him and her.
- Me: Yes.
- Them: And those remake. Oh, sorry.
- Me: If I. If I go to the products now.
- Them: Go on.
- Me: And filter on country. And look for Germany. You can already see these are. These are just countries here. Germany. You can already see that some of these are populated. It's quite quick doing it the slow bit. Is it coming from here into Google Ads? Give it about 20 minutes or something before it comes through. It depends on what the load is on their servers at the time, but it just takes a little while for it to come through. So you sometimes when you, if you do it too quickly, you're going to Google Ads, create everything, go to your listing group. Oh, it's not done. It. It's. Because it's just not populated yet. It's not instant. It's not instant coming in here, but that's pretty quick. But yeah, she writes, you can see that it is. If I were to filter on label. It's a good way to check to see what's. What's available in here. So we scroll down to Custom Label 4, you can see Githsahem gives for her Gisa him and her. Yeah. This is Sale one. There they just hangover. Essentially, what that means is it's not set to any of the others, but they're just hangovers from previous supplemental fees that have been done.
- Them: And you know how on the sheet, the G sheet. There's the item ID and custom label. 4. If you use the titles to pull items into that sheet, Where? At what point did the item IDs get there? That makes sense.
- Me: The AI was looking at merchant center.
- Them: Okay, so your AI is connected to the merchant, and you've asked. It's essentially to add in the IDs for those. Yeah. Makes sense.
- Me: Yes. Yes. Yeah. And you know what? At the end of the day, Lauren, it's not an exact science, and we don't necessarily want it to be. I don't necessarily need it to be. It'd be nice if it was an exact science, but it's not an exact science, but what we've got is now products which are likely to be gifts.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And we're capturing everything else. In the other asset group. The heroes and psychics asset group. But these are effectively our gifts, and it means we can just stop this.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, the gifting part of it, which is the point I was making with the. With the asset groups. Your heroes and sidekicks in the main PMAX campaign isn't about gifting. It's your heroes and psychics. The message is about your heroes and psychics. If someone's looking for a gift, they're going to be triggered by the audience that you have set up for your asset group and the search themes that are in the asset group. So when they see one of these products, which may exist in the Heroes and Psychics, Asset group, the main one. But if they're looking for gifts, they're more likely to see that gifting message. It's not correct if someone's looking for a pen. To show them Christmas gift messaging.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: They're looking for a pen. Yeah, that's a simplistic way of looking at it, but that's true. Now, the add text in the heroes and sidekicks has been left as it has got some Christmas gift messaging in there. But what we're looking at is relevance all the way through. So the relevance in the heroes and psychics.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Asset group in the main PMAX campaign is all about stationary and about Smythes and about all the stuff that you do. So that's going to attract the people who are looking for that kind of thing. They're looking for a vague idea on stationery. If, for instance, we have a stationary asset group, which we do, they're even more targeted on their search themes. Towards that. And they will get stuff even more targeted towards stationary as opposed to leather bags and accessories. So that's how we're channeling people now? What we were talking about the other week was about. Yes, but marketing, want, Christmas, messaging on everything. Well, I'm sure they do. And they're going to get Christmas messaging on all the searches that are related to people looking for Christmas gifts. If someone wants a piece of paper. They don't want an ad that says christmas gifts now available. Chris, that's the wrong place. What we want to do is attract clicks, don't we? We want to make that ad really relevant and the landing page really relevant. Don't land them on a Christmas gift page if they were looking for stationery. Give them all the stationery.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.
- Me: That was that huge email and sent you, that would be actively what that was. But I hope you were on board with that. Anyway, that was really the chunk of the work which you did on Friday was around Christmas gifting. And that's what's now going to roll forward to doing these in the other campaigns.
- Them: Yeah. That all sounds good. Yeah, I had a read through the email and it all made sense, so that's fine.
- Me: Good.
- Them: Cool. Apart from that, we've got Black Friday coming up next week. So, as you know, the campaign asset groups in PMAX will be paused and will have replacement Black Friday ones.
- Me: I don't agree with it. I really don't.
- Them: I know.
- Me: I would say once again. And it's Google best practice. I confirmed with Google we should be creating a Black Friday asset group in the same way as we do with Christmas, same as we do with gifting. And it's targeting people for black looking for Black Friday deals. It's not changing all the text in the main asset group or the majority of it is not to me is not correct and to Google is not correct.
- Them: We're not going to change. We're not going to affect the existing ones. We're going to duplicate of them and change the wording, the text and the imagery so that we're pushing Black Friday. But the asset groups that already exist, they're just going to be paused.
- Me: Could you just excuse me one second? Sorry. Here we go.
- Them: Yeah, no worries.
- Me: It's this time. It's 11:30. That's what does it. That's when the deliveries arrive.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Sorry.
- Them: No worries. So, yeah, we'll have essentially, like. Twins. Of what? It really exists. But they're just going to be Black Friday twins.
- Me: That's fine, but don't pause the existing asset group.
- Them: What we need.
- Me: That was the purpose of the piece on the best practices. All of a sudden you're pausing it and then starting it. After Black Friday, it's going, oh, right, where are we, then? Right, let's get going again. And it just interrupts that algorithm massively. So, yes, you might do well on Black Friday.
- Them: To.
- Me: But when it's after Black Friday, that asset group has to start not all over again, but it has to restart the algorithm and you jeopardizing the future revenue.
- Them: Do.
- Me: And profit profitability of that asset group. Which.
- Them: I understand. And I get what you mean. Like I. I do get it. It's just that the business wants to push Black Friday. And then slowly.
- Me: Yeah, they will do. If you duplicate that campaign, if you duplicate that asset group and you're absolutely clear on your search themes and your audience selection, it's people looking for bargains, then you will be pushing Black Friday. You could even change the image assets within.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have other image assets as well. It's just going to be like a Black Friday graphic.
- Me: Yeah. But just don't stop that asset group. Categorically don't stop that asset group. If you were to speak to Google, they would definitely. Do not do that. You got to leave it running.
- Them: Stan. It's just that if we leave it running, it could absorb more of the budget and.
- Me: Great. Well, it all converts as well. If it's people looking for pens and not Black Friday, fantastic.
- Them: So my thing was like, why not combine both the people who are looking for pens during Black Friday. Those. But if we talk in the asset group targeting, it will still be the same targeting. So leave it as it is in terms of like, pens or whatever they're looking for. But the imagery and the messaging has changed the Black Friday. So when they do see that payment they're looking for, they know. Oh, okay. I want this pen. But it's also on Black Friday. I was also going to speak about putting promotions on Merchant center, but I come to that in a minute. But, yeah, essentially, they'll still be looking for a pen. But they know it's on Black Friday. If we. If we had to complete a message at the same time, they may not be aware that it's Black Friday. Whereas we've got other competitors who are completely pushing Black Friday, and I think that's where Alex and Seb are coming from. But, like. We just need to push Black Friday because that's when.
- Me: In which case change some of the text on existing asset group, don't create a new asset group and pause existing one. The pause in the existing asset group is suicide. Seriously. It's going to seriously affect the revenue. If you do do that.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: That's my advice. That's my advice, and that's based upon the research I've done about this on Google.
- Them: I understand what you mean. Like, it's like when we reactivate them, the. It's the system going to have to reboot and all the kind of stuff, and it's going to go back to learning. I get that.
- Me: It wouldn't go back to learning. But it will be impacted by it. And I think if you want the best of both worlds, I would just add some Black Friday text into the existing asset group.
- Them: But. I think I'm just going to create a new asset groups because I wanted to just go live as soon as possible on Monday. Rather than having to like change around tax and then change it back again in two weeks time.
- Me: You're going live on Monday.
- Them: Yeah. It's for two weeks from the 17th. Till the second.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: So I'm just going to put my foot. My teams on do not disturb because lots of messages going around. But, yeah, they don't want to. They don't want to. Conflicting messages at the same time, they want to push Black Friday.
- Me: It won't be a conflicting message. Either get one or the other one.
- Them: And. Yeah. But. But they don't want the other one at all. Like we don't want to be seeing any Christmas. Assets. In the Black Friday asset group, there's going to be some text that says, like, smyrn pens or smarting luxury pens. Anyway, so I think it will be okay.
- Me: No, I disagree. I couldn't disagree more about the strategy.
- Them: As for like, when we reactivate like, do you have an idea of, like, how much you think it will affect revenue? Like.
- Me: I don't know whether I sent that over to whether it was. I mean, I couldn't give you a number. I mean, if I gave you a number, you wouldn't believe me anyway. As in, I wouldn't believe anyone who said, I can give you an actual number for it.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: But.
- Them: Because that's the main thing, like, Is. It is pausing. These are. It's going to affect our performance that like a lot.
- Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. The asset groups will pause in. The asset groups will make a difference.
- Them: It's like, how much of a difference?
- Me: See Google's official recommendation Add new asset groups for holiday created within existing campaigns. Layer promotional messaging onto current structure. And that was only created a separate campaign. You got different budgets and targets. Google warns that pausing and unpausing asset groups disrupts the algorithms learning. Real world experience shows that campaigns struggle to recover pre holiday performance after seasonal asset group support.
- Them: You send that to me, didn't you? In the chat?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay, well, I'll talk that Alexa about it again, but at the moment, this is what we want to do, and this is what we're doing.
- Me: It's just been blindfolded by this. I understand you want to put Black Friday messaging out there, and it will put Black Friday messaging out to the right people, but it's actually to the detriment of the performance of the Christmas campaigns. If someone's looking for if someone's looking for a Christmas gift. They want a Christmas message.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: They don't necessarily need a Black Friday one you can put. You can do a promotional extension on the search ads. For this because let's face it, at the end of the day, most of this is going to be in shopping ads, not in search. So you might have 90% of the spend. I'm making this up. But it's a large percentage of the spend is going to go towards shopping ads which won't have that messaging on anyway. And then see you jeopardizing the whole of that 90% spend after it's reactivated. By that 10% of ads, which will be search ads. Of which a lot of them will see the Black Friday messaging anyway. If we put some headlines in there that reflect Black Friday and put promotional extension on for Black Friday. I do. I think it's more a case of the business understanding. Exactly. What this means by having a separate Black Friday campaign, they're dictating the structure of the campaigns, not understanding the technicalities behind it.
- Them: But they want to do what they what we did last year, which was to help Black Friday attributes. I suggested two options. We do what we did last year, which is the separate Black Friday asset Group. Or we use what we have already used, product images for products, and then have Black Friday text, so you'll still get in both. But they just want everything to put feedback Friday, and that's what they're comfortable with. That's what Alex wants to go forward with, so.
- Me: Well, that's my recommendation, then.
- Them: Yeah, all right. I understand what you mean.
- Me: If that's what I'm battling against, then I want to just make it noted. I totally disagree with that. I understand what the business wants, but I think as I say, most of the spend is going to go on shopping ads anyway and you'll suddenly pausing your best asset group and starting a new one.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: And I just disagree with that. It may have happened last year, but was it successful? Don't know.
- Them: And they drove. The things were double counting anyway, so we can't really.
- Me: I know. I'll do some research if you want me to do some research, and I'll do some research on it if we can put some numbers behind it.
- Them: Say. If we want to. If you got, like, a spare moment after we've dealt with everything else. But, yeah, that's what we want to do. Also in cold. I was going to say about motions. Okay. So we'll come back to me. But as for Merchant Center. Yeah. So we want to put promotions on our shopping ad. So I think there's, like, a promo feature you can use in Merchant center, so we need to set that up.
- Me: There is. If there's specific drops in prices on specific products, then you could do a promotional feed.
- Them: Yeah. So it's level sensitive, it's level goods. Like home accessories etc.
- Me: It would need a list of skews.
- Them: No.
- Me: Product ideas.
- Them: I think I've got that. Just give me a second. I feel this Black Friday thing is something we'd have to test, but it's like there's no time to test it. Choose something. Just go with me a moment.
- Me: I don't think you want to see this my screen anymore. So I've just realized I'm still sharing that.
- Them: Right, so it's Leverin. Books, notebooks. Full price product offered at 30 or 20% off. I don't know which one that is. Like, what's 20 or what's 30%? But yeah.
- Me: So in order to set the feed up, we need to know what the products are and what the actual offer is. Specifically what the offer is.
- Them: Have a list and it's got barcodes. Use.
- Me: Just the product id that's all that's needed.
- Them: Okay. Books are 20% off. Lever is 30% off. No diaries. Product exclusions or diaries. Let me share my screen. Diaries, stationery, writing instruments and refills. I miss you. As well. But yeah. So Libra is 30% off. Yeah.
- Me: Is that article the product id?
- Them: I don't think. I. Would have been much incentive to back up. Just looking for the old product to do.
- Me: I would have picked the German one. Flight car? Yes, it is the product id.
- Them: Sorry. What's that? Add article.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So if I share this sheet of you. I mean, I don't know. What is it something you'll do like your AI to.
- Me: It's just promotional. Promotional product fee going in. So it had the actual offer in there, didn't it?
- Them: Respond. So all of these products in this list are lever 30% or they'll go into a feed.
- Me: On the 17th. Right. It's going to take a bit of processing, though. I'll have to disseminate the actual. Which I'll have to create a number of different promotions. First. Which are 30% off and whatever else is on that list. And then set up the feed so it matches those. All right, so we got the two of them. So it's two promotions, and then put the relevant products against each promotion.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: I haven't done it before, but I would like to learn. So. Yeah, but if you want to do it because you have more experience with it, that's fine. If I can watch you do it, that would be great. Second Then.
- Me: It's not a five minute job that Aaron.
- Them: That's fine.
- Me: Ok, yeah, ping that over and I'll. I'll set something up.
- Them: Okay? I will send that a little. What I'll do is just. I'll just reconfirm the email. What? We're doing and send that over as well. And then I was going to put countdown customizers on the search ads as well. But I just need to, like, show Alex what that's going to look like. So it's like, final bit and then we'll have like cross site links, call outs, stretch snippets, etc. So yeah. But. About? It. I will also send you that peak pen, which just covers, like, the Christmas extra campaigns that we're creating, and then the Black Friday stuff.
- Me: Right, well, I'm gonna. I'm gonna work on this. Email the handover document he sent over last week.
- Them: Okay, that's fine. I have some reporting to do today because for a meeting just to cover, like, the last period. P7. So that's for tomorrow, and then I can do the Bing campaigns.
- Me: Ok?
- Them: Yeah. That's fine. And then I'm just going to have a little marketing on what's happening with the Black Friday visuals and stuff like that. But yeah.
- Me: Well, I've got those translations then for the French, German, Italian.
- Them: Thanks. Yeah, it's for gifting and diaries.
- Me: Ok, cool. And I'll get the feeds in and do the merchant center promotion, ok?
- Them: Cool. And I will adjust your gift in that copy as well. Just a neat little tweaks. Cool. Thank you so much.
- Me: Oh. So, yes. And if you could do some a steer on future brand guidelines and stuff. That'd be lovely.
- Them: No problem.
- Me: Make it easy in the future, wouldn't it?
- Them: Yeah. Oh, thanks, peter.
- Me: Okie dokie.
- Them: We could say.
- Me: Have a good one. Bye.

## Strategic Decisions

- Preserve budget for peak performance period
- Create new PMAX campaign structure for European markets
- Implement separate Black Friday asset groups (against recommended best practices)

## Key Learnings

- Conversion rates typically surge from Nov 15th
- Pausing existing asset groups can disrupt algorithm learning
- Campaign-specific ROAS reduction approach needed

## Transcript

--- Enhanced Notes ---
### Campaign Performance & Strategy Dashboard

- Actual revenue: £164k vs expected £178k (using last year’s pacing model)
- 50%+ of revenue typically comes from Nov 22nd onwards
- Conversion rates increase significantly from Nov 15th (this year: Nov 16th as 15th is Saturday)
- Strategy: preserve budget for peak period rather than spending early
- European ROAS performing exceptionally well at 607%
- UK ROAS at 407% - above expected levels

### Budget Adjustments & Microsoft Ads

- Need G-sheet budget updates for P8 and P9 periods
- Microsoft Ads campaigns - confirm if these are new launches
- Budget increases planned for Friday (Nov 14th) ahead of conversion rate surge
- ROAS target reductions recommended for high-performing campaigns
- Apply larger reductions to campaigns significantly exceeding targets
- Leave marginal performers unchanged
- Campaign-specific approach needed rather than blanket 4.3 to 3.8 ROAS reduction

### European Market Expansion

- New PMAX campaign structure for gifting/diaries:
- Germany: Single campaign with diary + gifting asset groups
- France: PMAX with diaries + gifting asset groups
- Italy: PMAX with diaries + gifting asset groups
- Rest of Europe: English-language campaign with both asset groups
- Rest of World: English-language PMAX with both categories
- Merchant Center supplemental feeds created for Germany, France, Italy
- Custom label 4 configured for “gifts for him/her” product categorization
- 20-minute delay typical between feed setup and Google Ads availability

### Black Friday Campaign Strategy Disagreement

- Peter strongly opposes pausing existing asset groups for Black Friday
- Recommends creating additional Black Friday asset groups within existing campaigns
- Google best practice: layer promotional messaging onto current structure
- Risk assessment: pausing/unpausing disrupts algorithm learning, affects post-holiday performance
- Business decision: proceed with separate Black Friday asset groups (Nov 17th - Dec 2nd)
- Alternative suggestions: add Black Friday text to existing groups, use promotional extensions

### Promotional Setup & Next Steps

- Black Friday promotions in Merchant Center:
- Lever products: 30% off
- Books: 20% off
- Excludes diaries, stationery, writing instruments, refills
- Product ID list provided for promotional feed creation
- Countdown customizers planned for search ads
- Ad copy brand guidelines needed for future campaigns
- Translation requirements: French, German, Italian copy for gifting/diaries campaigns

### Action Items

- Peter: Update G-sheet with P8/P9 budgets, set up promotional feeds, create translated campaigns
- Alex: Provide brand guidelines, confirm Microsoft Ads campaign status, review Black Friday visual assets
- Peter: Research Black Friday strategy impact data if time permits
- Alex: Adjust gifting ad copy with minor tweaks before implementation

Me: Oh, the Microsoft ads. Campaigns new ones.
Them: Peter.
Me: Hi. Just one sec. Oh, God. I've disappeared. Sorry.
Them: No. Worries.
Me: Teams. Teams. There we go. I'm back again. There we go. Do you have a nice long weekend?
Them: Thank you. I went to wooden.
Me: Oh, nice.
Them: Noise. Brings my friend? Yeah, I was meant to wedding in Manchester. My partner's best friend.
Me: All right.
Them: So that was really nice.
Me: Lovely.
Them: So, yeah, we had lots of fun. It was like. Yeah, it was just a really nice weekend. It rained a little bit, but it was really, really nice.
Me: That's enough for you.
Them: Yeah.
Me: What about Sumanchester? Was it?
Them: So could. Well, I don't know if this is exactly Manchester, but someone called Knutsford.
Me: Oh, no. So, susie. Then. Nice.
Them: Oh, yeah.
Me: Posh, Very poshy nuts.
Them: This is how you can tell I'm from down south? Because I don't know what I'm talking about.
Me: It was just somewhere up north.
Them: Yes. But it was really nice.
Me: Nuts was beautiful. It's really, really nice around there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I used to ride my bike round there a fair bit. This tattoo parks around there as well. At least you weren't actually in Manchester. It was a nice place where you were.
Them: We went to a restaurant in Manchester City center on Saturday night when we came down, but then after that, we were at the venue for most, for the most part.
Me: Right. Lovely.
Them: So. Yeah, it was really good. How about you? How was your weekend?
Me: Yeah, it was good. I did nothing. I say did nothing. We did less than we would normally do. It was just a chilling out weekend. We'd been out the weekend before and we're going to the Lake District this coming weekend. So it was a recharge your batteries weekend. And plus the rugby was on as well, so I needed to watch that.
Them: When the next go see, it's like my boyfriend, he's in Manchester United fan. It's like, when that's on, everything else doesn't exist, just football.
Me: Same here. Yeah. I must admit, I'm more rugby than football. I do like you know, I do support United. And I've been many times to watch. Not recently, but in the past. But I do. I prefer a game of rugby to football any day. Far better. Far back.
Them: Did you ever play?
Me: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I played at school and fell out of love with it. And then I went back when I was early 20s. Something like that and just got a bit too battered. I played for about three, four seasons, but it was, yeah. It was. It's hard when you can't actually get our bed on the Sunday morning after play, and you go, I shouldn't really be doing this. Oh, it's a great game. I think it helps if you've actually played, you know, to understand it. Otherwise it can be very complicated game, and it's getting more and more complicated. As time goes on, they just add in new bits and pieces to it. It's not like, kick the ball into that net there. I'll tell you about offside, and don't kick anybody in the legs. And that's about it for football. I maybe oversimplified it.
Them: Football. Quite simple. Like, why is it so interesting? It's literally just kicking around the ball.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Them: Yeah, Regarding work. Yeah, I know we'd like had a bit of a record for about the ad copy, and thank you for just covering my workload while I was away. Yeah. I had a look at your ad copy, and for the most part, it's fine. It's just like some of the headlines just need adjusting a little bit so I can do that.
Me: Okay? Whatever I say, I put it in. I put it in that format on the G sheet. So, you know, if you want to just ping it across to marketing, fine. If you see in there that you want me to bear in mind for the future when creating ad text, then just let me know and I can just add it. To the system, and I'll make sure it doesn't. It's like the 137 years. I still think that's a good line, but there you go.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It made me look a bit too precise. I'm gonna have to go back in every year to go and change it to the next year, but, you know. But yeah, if there's anything. If you never want the word now in there, then just let me know, just. Even just in a text, and I. Can I. Can add it to the. To the system.
Them: What I can do is. Yeah, just create a list of, like, brand guidelines for you.
Me: Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.
Them: And that's fine. On. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, we can say over 135 years or 137 years. I just say over 135 just so that we'd have to change it every year.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: And yeah, so when I went the gift in ad set to asset groups last week, Monday, I'd like created ad copy for it.
Me: I didn't really, like, done that because it, when I looked at it, the Christmas gifts for her wasn't about Christmas gifts for her. It was a bit more genericy than, you know, gender related.
Them: And then. Yeah. And that's fine. Like, it's always good to get, like, feedback and improve things. So, like, thanks for that. And I think, like, what you've done is good. I'll just make some tweaks to it and then, like, it can be implemented. If you be able to implement it. That would be great. And if you could just give me an edit access, then I can just make a few tweaks to it.
Me: Okay? Oh, sorry. Have I not done. Apologies.
Them: No view only. And then the translated copy.
Me: What was it called?
Them: I'll ping every blink to you.
Me: Oh, I actually sent. I'd sent you a link. Hasn't.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Lovely. Thank you.
Them: So, yeah, the copy that was in there before, I had given Luciana to give to the translation agency, because a translation. So what? EU and the rest of the world, we probably won't be able to make any further tweaks for now, because it's translated.
Me: I don't really want. I definitely don't want to.
Them: But. Yes. But as for US and uk, it's a lot easier to make changes or update things, and so that's fine. And then I. So I know, like, we've got a bit of a gap between what the business wants for revenue and what we could realistically achieve with what we've got. So last week, I, like, put together some ideas for. How we can kind of reject the app and shown Alex, I will share it with you as well. And that was like the things like putting more campaigns live on Bing, the brand lever accessories, stationary brand bags, and then the gifting and diaries campaigns for pmax and eu. With Bing. I know that you can import campaigns from Google. I just haven't done it in a very long time. So I need to kind of.
Me: Specific ones. I mean, I know on your hand. I just didn't have a time, Lauren.
Them: Find no worries.
Me: I think we need to sort of talk about my involvement in this and what it is. Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not an assistant. And I'm not a permanent. I'm not a full time employee. At the end of the day, I've no, I have no problem doing this stuff.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I've spent all my time doing the dashboard and doing. Sorting the strategy out so we can actually monitor it and try and help with the whole thing. But I've no, I have no problem doing this, the gifting stuff. It was, it was doing the asset groups, he's doing the search themes, and it was doing the, the, the, the merchant center feed. So all that stuff needs doing for all those, the EU gifting, PMaxes and stuff. It's just making sure that all those feeds are done, you know, so, yes, it's a case of copying over the existing one, putting it into. Into merchant center and then then running it in. It all. It all just adds up. So it's not as I'm just ignoring you, it's just it's having the actual time to do it. Last week was quite heavy on kind of the strategy thing? I don't know. You looked at the strategy dashboard? I think it's where we want it to be because it's giving a day to day traffic light system. You know, if you look at it now, actual revenue, 164 grand. Expected revenue 178 grand. So it's using the pacing from last year. The revenue in the 50 odd percent of it of the revenue was brought in from 22nd November onwards. So I've applied that to this year as to what we can expect to happen. So I'm just, I'M trying to make things a bit more transparent for you. And, you know, so you can understand this, why the way the budgets goes? Because you could just look at it. We're doing really well. Let's just add a load of budget to it. Whereas really, we want to be keeping our powder dry for the 15th, really, is when it all kicks off so that we've got when that conversion rate starts to increase, then, you know, we've got enough budget to, to throw at it and maximize it. I had a really good call with, with Google yesterday. Just, just as an aside about. And they always say this about when Christmas is actually starting. And they'll always talk about fake Friday, you know, the Friday before. But it's definitely the 15th, when the conversion rate starts to increase. Definitely. And what we're on.
Them: Yeah. And that's what you've seen. Sorry. That's what you've seen based on our account from, like, last year and how you created your.
Me: Yeah, well, from a lot of accounts. Yeah, a lot of accounts. I'm seeing that. And, like, we're on the 11th now, you know? It's tempting just to. Just to chuck all the money in now, but we'll get more of a return from the 15th onwards in terms of conversion rates increasing, especially when we're limited by the budget that we've got.
Them: Yeah, that's fine. Alex had shown me, like, kind of, like how he had kind of split out the budget and, like, demand and stuff. And so it. He kind of put, like, 15% for, like, last week for team setup with budget, and then this week would be like 19, and then next week is 27%, and then the following week. Is like 39% of the budget. So it like kind of staggers and it is meant to be continue to increase. So I'd increase budgets on Friday. I've also increased some campaign budgets today, even though we're not spending all of that money, like, so we are a bit behind on pacing. But this time, because hopefully we'll catch up.
Me: Yeah.
Them: After the 15th. Given that 15th is a Saturday, if there's any change I need to make, that will need to be done on Friday.
Me: I do it on Friday. I do it the 14th. You think the 15th last year was probably the Friday.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So that's fine. And so that will be things like lowering the row as targets and increasing budgets. First one, just to continue your dashboard. So, yeah, we've got rose reduction. What do you mean by the rest of world campaign launch?
Me: I forget that it's. There was some confusion over whether it was launched or not, so apologies for that. Forget that one.
Them: Okay? No worries. Cool. So, yeah, so on Friday, we'll just be roast reductions. Even though you put uk. Do you? We. We should be reducing our votes across all of the accounts.
Me: No, not necessarily. The USA one was pretty much the week later.
Them: So.
Me: It was more delayed on the, on the, on the increase than it was for the, for the uk.
Them: We're just like. Are all the campaigns in, like, for example, the UK meant to have the same target for us? Cuz they kind of, yeah, they all behave a bit differently.
Me: No. Yes, they do.
Them: So where.
Me: If you. I could help with that if you want. You know, if.
Them: I think it's more just understanding, like, what the recommendation is here, because, like, it's kind of like a general, like, 4.3 to 3.8. You vote all of the different campaigns in the UK account or in different places right now in terms of roas. So is it like.
Me: My, my, my suggestion would be that we, we'd kind of look at this in terms of what is happening at the moment and which campaigns are actually performing well.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And apply more of a target reduction to those. So if you're looking at, you know, if it says it's a 350 ROAS and it's achieving 450, then that's, that's a good one. You know, that's, that's one we can reduce if it's. Only just achieving the ROAS target. They're maybe not do it. You know, just leave his illus for now and just. Just do this on a. On a dynamic thing. And it looks so precise, doesn't it? Think I've got to absolutely hit that. It's not. We're over. We're over indexing on roas at the moment anyway, which are nice place to be in, you know, if you reckon that the actual roas. I'm looking at the uk.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
Me: Is 407. That's above where it was expected to be. Europe is doing particularly well. In terms of roas. So, you know, it may be that we want to put more money towards them if they're hitting a higher roas target. Sorry. A higher roas figure.
Them: That makes sense. Cool. And then, yeah, you mentioned about, like, your workload and stuff and. Yeah, I think if we just need to communicate about, like, what if you've got things to do, then I can, like, manage my expectations around that as well. I think last week was probably just very busy for both of us. And, yeah, I don't know about you, but I ended up working late quite a lot last week. Yeah, just trying to figure out how we can, like, work together.
Me: Welcome to my world.
Them: So we could work together to get everything done. But I understand, like, you probably got, like, other clients work to get done as well. I know, like, you're. You're not my assistant, and I really respect your experience, and, like, there's a lot to learn from you. When Alex said, yeah.
Me: Well, we got to do, though. We've got stuff to do. Yeah.
Them: When Alex said that you were coming back, he mentioned that you were coming back to support and. Yeah, helped me with the workload. So I think I've just been trying to figure out, like, how do I kind of, like, work with you? But I don't want to be, like, micromanaging you either, because. You know what you're doing, so. Yeah, it's just, like, been trying to figure that out, really.
Me: Yeah. I know it's not. I know it's not easy, Lauren. I know. I don't want to make it difficult for you. I've got a list of stuff to do there. On the gifting and diaries campaigns, for instance. I don't necessarily agree with them. I don't necessarily agree we should be launching at this stage of PMAX for France. But. If we're going to launch it, let's do it, like, in the next couple of days to make the most of it. The European ROAS is 607. Maybe there is more potential there, whether there's potential for individual countries.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Remains to be seen. And I'm. I'm all. I'm also very conscious of. Making sure that we're spending the money on the campaigns we already have that are producing. You know, not restricting them by budget. So it'd be interesting to see what we do with the spend on these.
Them: Exactly.
Me: But if we restricted too much, it's not going to be worth doing them in the first place. So it's difficult, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I agree with, like having just like a one campaign for all of the European markets. But the only thing I was concerned about, yeah, that's the thing, is the only way to separate it out and make sure that only the Germany's people, German people see German language is by campaign, which is really annoying.
Me: What language? Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah, yeah.
Them: So that's the only reason I'd like said it that way.
Me: The french. Diaries. Pmax and italian diaries. Pmax. I just don't know. I don't know whether our time will be better. Not time, because it wouldn't make any difference on time is actually putting having a German, French and Italian PMAX campaign with these as asset groups within there. Rather than doing separate campaigns for all of those, and bundled together, you bundled together the budget for France, the French PMAX campaign, the Italian PMAX campaign. If you look back on conversion, the conversion history on those, there's not a lot of traffic goes through them. German one's probably the best one.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And of course, the European one will be the one that is potentially going to do the best, because I presume that's going to be in English. Targeting English speakers rather than the others are going to be in their particular languages. And the rest of the world are going to be in English, so they're relatively straightforward to do. Apart from the merchants, then to feed. It's just the individual language ones. If we can bundle them together in an individual PMAX campaign for that country.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And have asset groups of diaries and gifting within there and then post Christmas, if it's doing really well on, say on the diaries, we can just pause the gifting one at that time.
Them: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Because that was my other idea. It was either separated mine into diary, have one diaries, one gift in, or put them in the same campaign. But then I was thinking, what if they perform differently? With diaries performed a lot better than gifting or vice versa. Should they be in the same campaign?
Me: I would suggest that don't try and second guess it. Run it. And if they do, then move it out rather than presume that they're going to do by and create separate campaigns.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Actually just chuck them all together. Chuck it all together in one country. If we find that the diaries or the gifting is crashing and burning, just pulls it, or move the other one out or whatever it might be. But do it on the do it on the stats rather than the presumption, I think is what I'M saying.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So the new structure will be Germany will have a campaign with diary and gifting asset group. French will have pmax with diaries and gifting, same for Italy and then rest of Europe will have diaries and gift in. And then you have rest of. Yeah. In English. And then rest of world will have a Peanuts coming with diaries and gifted cool.
Me: In english. Correct? Yeah.
Them: Yeah, that sounds good.
Me: Ok?
Them: When you do the feeds, is it okay if I. When you do it, could I, like, watch you do it? Just so I can, like. Yeah. Just want to continue learning about feeds and how you're fit. Yeah. Really need to get better at.
Me: Well, the thing is, with those fees, they already exist, don't they? The gifting ones are already there. So it's just a case of putting it into merchant center.
Them: Yeah. Okay? This supplements were feed.
Me: Just using a different language and country. I can do it right now if you want.
Them: S modifier code again.
Me: Cool. I actually record every time now on these. It's part of the new system. I'm just trying to capture everything. So I should really tell you at the beginning of the call, but.
Them: That is fine.
Me: It's almost expected these days, isn't it? Right, let me just. Share. Right, so we're on merchant center data sources, Supplemental sources. So last update is. So when you do a Google sheet as your source. As in here.
Them: That's the same one we were looking at last week, right?
Me: Yes, there were. So you can see we've got this one here, Custom Label Zero. And we've got custom label four. These are the ones we were doing last week. So custom label for is a gifts for him. Gifts for her label. So if we do this one here, gifts are him and her. We can see that that is us english. And this one here is uk english. So this will be for the UK account and this one will be for the US account.
Them: Y. Eah. Okay? Cool. And just to go over again, you created that sheet from AI. Just pull in the items from the page, from the gift page, and then matching it with the item IDs from the feed.
Me: Well, it's more likely to be matching on a title in the feed rather than IDS because the ID is not surfaced on the web page. But, yes, that's pretty much what it did. So I'm just going to open that.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Now. Just so I know where that one is. So I've just taken it off to another page. Just checking for her, for him, for him. Okay? So. I'm going to just copy the name of this. And I'm going to add supplemental product data. I'm going to use Google sheets. Choose an existing sheets. Choose spreadsheet. And that's the one there, because I've just opened it. There's another reason for opening it. Goes to the top of the list when you. When you open it. Thinking about it. There we go. Says smart and custom label for gifs. Ok? Continue. So this is the bit where we want to specify which country it's going to go to. So I'm going to do. Feed label of de for germany. Language is german. And the data. This is almost like a confirmation that you've selected the right thing. So this is when it says select primary data source, it's going to attach itself to that data source. You know, the primary data source. The primary data source always been from Feed optimize. So there's a feed optimized. German feed, and we're going to attach it to it. So we'll attach it to the products within this feed. So we click the box there.
Them: Okay?
Me: Create data source.
Them: So essentially, it will match the item ID from your sheet and the item IDS from Feed Optimize. Okay, cool.
Me: Correct. Yeah. For germany. Now I'm going to just go in and to go into data source setup. It always puts a crappy name in there for the source name, so I'm just going to do that.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So when we look at it in the supplemental feed, it'll actually be correct. And then before you go away from it, do an it's automatic. Set schedule. So then click on update. And it's now running in. It won't do it straight away, but if we go back to. The list of supplemental sources. Really annoying. Doesn't put out at the top. We can see that one there. So I've done. I've sorted on last updated because this is. This is the one we just dragged in. So custom label 4 gives a him and her used in feed optimize the German so that now will now be associated with it. So what I do with the p. Max in the European account. It will be able to reference that custom label for in there when doing the listing groups. Yeah. So we can select on gifs for him or gifs for her. So the gifs for her, you select gifs of him. Sorry. Rewind when you select in the listing group for the PMAX campaign, if you're doing an asset group of GIFs for her, you're selecting GIFs for her custom label for. And it gives for him and her custom label for. Yeah, because it's both of them. Because there are products that are associated with GIFs for him and her. So don't exclude any. We don't want to look at things that are just exclusively gifts for her. We want to look for stuff across the board. Ok, so I've done that for Germany and I'll do that for Franc Italy.
Them: Okay? Cool. Yeah. Sorry.
Me: Europe.
Them: Cool.
Me: Not too sure how to do it for rest of the world. But I will. I'll think of something. Ok, so I've called them the same thing here.
Them: Okay?
Me: So we know where they're from because it uses the same G sheet. It just changes that bit there, just to make sure it's channeled through to the right. Through to the right country and language combination.
Them: Cool.
Me: Ok?
Them: So. On the custom label for those gifts for him, gift for her, and then gift for him and her.
Me: Yes.
Them: And those remake. Oh, sorry.
Me: If I. If I go to the products now.
Them: Go on.
Me: And filter on country. And look for Germany. You can already see these are. These are just countries here. Germany. You can already see that some of these are populated. It's quite quick doing it the slow bit. Is it coming from here into Google Ads? Give it about 20 minutes or something before it comes through. It depends on what the load is on their servers at the time, but it just takes a little while for it to come through. So you sometimes when you, if you do it too quickly, you're going to Google Ads, create everything, go to your listing group. Oh, it's not done. It. It's. Because it's just not populated yet. It's not instant. It's not instant coming in here, but that's pretty quick. But yeah, she writes, you can see that it is. If I were to filter on label. It's a good way to check to see what's. What's available in here. So we scroll down to Custom Label 4, you can see Githsahem gives for her Gisa him and her. Yeah. This is Sale one. There they just hangover. Essentially, what that means is it's not set to any of the others, but they're just hangovers from previous supplemental fees that have been done.
Them: And you know how on the sheet, the G sheet. There's the item ID and custom label. 4. If you use the titles to pull items into that sheet, Where? At what point did the item IDs get there? That makes sense.
Me: The AI was looking at merchant center.
Them: Okay, so your AI is connected to the merchant, and you've asked. It's essentially to add in the IDs for those. Yeah. Makes sense.
Me: Yes. Yes. Yeah. And you know what? At the end of the day, Lauren, it's not an exact science, and we don't necessarily want it to be. I don't necessarily need it to be. It'd be nice if it was an exact science, but it's not an exact science, but what we've got is now products which are likely to be gifts.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And we're capturing everything else. In the other asset group. The heroes and psychics asset group. But these are effectively our gifts, and it means we can just stop this.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, the gifting part of it, which is the point I was making with the. With the asset groups. Your heroes and sidekicks in the main PMAX campaign isn't about gifting. It's your heroes and psychics. The message is about your heroes and psychics. If someone's looking for a gift, they're going to be triggered by the audience that you have set up for your asset group and the search themes that are in the asset group. So when they see one of these products, which may exist in the Heroes and Psychics, Asset group, the main one. But if they're looking for gifts, they're more likely to see that gifting message. It's not correct if someone's looking for a pen. To show them Christmas gift messaging.
Them: Okay?
Me: They're looking for a pen. Yeah, that's a simplistic way of looking at it, but that's true. Now, the add text in the heroes and sidekicks has been left as it has got some Christmas gift messaging in there. But what we're looking at is relevance all the way through. So the relevance in the heroes and psychics.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Asset group in the main PMAX campaign is all about stationary and about Smythes and about all the stuff that you do. So that's going to attract the people who are looking for that kind of thing. They're looking for a vague idea on stationery. If, for instance, we have a stationary asset group, which we do, they're even more targeted on their search themes. Towards that. And they will get stuff even more targeted towards stationary as opposed to leather bags and accessories. So that's how we're channeling people now? What we were talking about the other week was about. Yes, but marketing, want, Christmas, messaging on everything. Well, I'm sure they do. And they're going to get Christmas messaging on all the searches that are related to people looking for Christmas gifts. If someone wants a piece of paper. They don't want an ad that says christmas gifts now available. Chris, that's the wrong place. What we want to do is attract clicks, don't we? We want to make that ad really relevant and the landing page really relevant. Don't land them on a Christmas gift page if they were looking for stationery. Give them all the stationery.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.
Me: That was that huge email and sent you, that would be actively what that was. But I hope you were on board with that. Anyway, that was really the chunk of the work which you did on Friday was around Christmas gifting. And that's what's now going to roll forward to doing these in the other campaigns.
Them: Yeah. That all sounds good. Yeah, I had a read through the email and it all made sense, so that's fine.
Me: Good.
Them: Cool. Apart from that, we've got Black Friday coming up next week. So, as you know, the campaign asset groups in PMAX will be paused and will have replacement Black Friday ones.
Me: I don't agree with it. I really don't.
Them: I know.
Me: I would say once again. And it's Google best practice. I confirmed with Google we should be creating a Black Friday asset group in the same way as we do with Christmas, same as we do with gifting. And it's targeting people for black looking for Black Friday deals. It's not changing all the text in the main asset group or the majority of it is not to me is not correct and to Google is not correct.
Them: We're not going to change. We're not going to affect the existing ones. We're going to duplicate of them and change the wording, the text and the imagery so that we're pushing Black Friday. But the asset groups that already exist, they're just going to be paused.
Me: Could you just excuse me one second? Sorry. Here we go.
Them: Yeah, no worries.
Me: It's this time. It's 11:30. That's what does it. That's when the deliveries arrive.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Sorry.
Them: No worries. So, yeah, we'll have essentially, like. Twins. Of what? It really exists. But they're just going to be Black Friday twins.
Me: That's fine, but don't pause the existing asset group.
Them: What we need.
Me: That was the purpose of the piece on the best practices. All of a sudden you're pausing it and then starting it. After Black Friday, it's going, oh, right, where are we, then? Right, let's get going again. And it just interrupts that algorithm massively. So, yes, you might do well on Black Friday.
Them: To.
Me: But when it's after Black Friday, that asset group has to start not all over again, but it has to restart the algorithm and you jeopardizing the future revenue.
Them: Do.
Me: And profit profitability of that asset group. Which.
Them: I understand. And I get what you mean. Like I. I do get it. It's just that the business wants to push Black Friday. And then slowly.
Me: Yeah, they will do. If you duplicate that campaign, if you duplicate that asset group and you're absolutely clear on your search themes and your audience selection, it's people looking for bargains, then you will be pushing Black Friday. You could even change the image assets within.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have other image assets as well. It's just going to be like a Black Friday graphic.
Me: Yeah. But just don't stop that asset group. Categorically don't stop that asset group. If you were to speak to Google, they would definitely. Do not do that. You got to leave it running.
Them: Stan. It's just that if we leave it running, it could absorb more of the budget and.
Me: Great. Well, it all converts as well. If it's people looking for pens and not Black Friday, fantastic.
Them: So my thing was like, why not combine both the people who are looking for pens during Black Friday. Those. But if we talk in the asset group targeting, it will still be the same targeting. So leave it as it is in terms of like, pens or whatever they're looking for. But the imagery and the messaging has changed the Black Friday. So when they do see that payment they're looking for, they know. Oh, okay. I want this pen. But it's also on Black Friday. I was also going to speak about putting promotions on Merchant center, but I come to that in a minute. But, yeah, essentially, they'll still be looking for a pen. But they know it's on Black Friday. If we. If we had to complete a message at the same time, they may not be aware that it's Black Friday. Whereas we've got other competitors who are completely pushing Black Friday, and I think that's where Alex and Seb are coming from. But, like. We just need to push Black Friday because that's when.
Me: In which case change some of the text on existing asset group, don't create a new asset group and pause existing one. The pause in the existing asset group is suicide. Seriously. It's going to seriously affect the revenue. If you do do that.
Them: Okay?
Me: That's my advice. That's my advice, and that's based upon the research I've done about this on Google.
Them: I understand what you mean. Like, it's like when we reactivate them, the. It's the system going to have to reboot and all the kind of stuff, and it's going to go back to learning. I get that.
Me: It wouldn't go back to learning. But it will be impacted by it. And I think if you want the best of both worlds, I would just add some Black Friday text into the existing asset group.
Them: But. I think I'm just going to create a new asset groups because I wanted to just go live as soon as possible on Monday. Rather than having to like change around tax and then change it back again in two weeks time.
Me: You're going live on Monday.
Them: Yeah. It's for two weeks from the 17th. Till the second.
Me: Ok?
Them: So I'm just going to put my foot. My teams on do not disturb because lots of messages going around. But, yeah, they don't want to. They don't want to. Conflicting messages at the same time, they want to push Black Friday.
Me: It won't be a conflicting message. Either get one or the other one.
Them: And. Yeah. But. But they don't want the other one at all. Like we don't want to be seeing any Christmas. Assets. In the Black Friday asset group, there's going to be some text that says, like, smyrn pens or smarting luxury pens. Anyway, so I think it will be okay.
Me: No, I disagree. I couldn't disagree more about the strategy.
Them: As for like, when we reactivate like, do you have an idea of, like, how much you think it will affect revenue? Like.
Me: I don't know whether I sent that over to whether it was. I mean, I couldn't give you a number. I mean, if I gave you a number, you wouldn't believe me anyway. As in, I wouldn't believe anyone who said, I can give you an actual number for it.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: But.
Them: Because that's the main thing, like, Is. It is pausing. These are. It's going to affect our performance that like a lot.
Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. The asset groups will pause in. The asset groups will make a difference.
Them: It's like, how much of a difference?
Me: See Google's official recommendation Add new asset groups for holiday created within existing campaigns. Layer promotional messaging onto current structure. And that was only created a separate campaign. You got different budgets and targets. Google warns that pausing and unpausing asset groups disrupts the algorithms learning. Real world experience shows that campaigns struggle to recover pre holiday performance after seasonal asset group support.
Them: You send that to me, didn't you? In the chat?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay, well, I'll talk that Alexa about it again, but at the moment, this is what we want to do, and this is what we're doing.
Me: It's just been blindfolded by this. I understand you want to put Black Friday messaging out there, and it will put Black Friday messaging out to the right people, but it's actually to the detriment of the performance of the Christmas campaigns. If someone's looking for if someone's looking for a Christmas gift. They want a Christmas message.
Them: Yeah.
Me: They don't necessarily need a Black Friday one you can put. You can do a promotional extension on the search ads. For this because let's face it, at the end of the day, most of this is going to be in shopping ads, not in search. So you might have 90% of the spend. I'm making this up. But it's a large percentage of the spend is going to go towards shopping ads which won't have that messaging on anyway. And then see you jeopardizing the whole of that 90% spend after it's reactivated. By that 10% of ads, which will be search ads. Of which a lot of them will see the Black Friday messaging anyway. If we put some headlines in there that reflect Black Friday and put promotional extension on for Black Friday. I do. I think it's more a case of the business understanding. Exactly. What this means by having a separate Black Friday campaign, they're dictating the structure of the campaigns, not understanding the technicalities behind it.
Them: But they want to do what they what we did last year, which was to help Black Friday attributes. I suggested two options. We do what we did last year, which is the separate Black Friday asset Group. Or we use what we have already used, product images for products, and then have Black Friday text, so you'll still get in both. But they just want everything to put feedback Friday, and that's what they're comfortable with. That's what Alex wants to go forward with, so.
Me: Well, that's my recommendation, then.
Them: Yeah, all right. I understand what you mean.
Me: If that's what I'm battling against, then I want to just make it noted. I totally disagree with that. I understand what the business wants, but I think as I say, most of the spend is going to go on shopping ads anyway and you'll suddenly pausing your best asset group and starting a new one.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: And I just disagree with that. It may have happened last year, but was it successful? Don't know.
Them: And they drove. The things were double counting anyway, so we can't really.
Me: I know. I'll do some research if you want me to do some research, and I'll do some research on it if we can put some numbers behind it.
Them: Say. If we want to. If you got, like, a spare moment after we've dealt with everything else. But, yeah, that's what we want to do. Also in cold. I was going to say about motions. Okay. So we'll come back to me. But as for Merchant Center. Yeah. So we want to put promotions on our shopping ad. So I think there's, like, a promo feature you can use in Merchant center, so we need to set that up.
Me: There is. If there's specific drops in prices on specific products, then you could do a promotional feed.
Them: Yeah. So it's level sensitive, it's level goods. Like home accessories etc.
Me: It would need a list of skews.
Them: No.
Me: Product ideas.
Them: I think I've got that. Just give me a second. I feel this Black Friday thing is something we'd have to test, but it's like there's no time to test it. Choose something. Just go with me a moment.
Me: I don't think you want to see this my screen anymore. So I've just realized I'm still sharing that.
Them: Right, so it's Leverin. Books, notebooks. Full price product offered at 30 or 20% off. I don't know which one that is. Like, what's 20 or what's 30%? But yeah.
Me: So in order to set the feed up, we need to know what the products are and what the actual offer is. Specifically what the offer is.
Them: Have a list and it's got barcodes. Use.
Me: Just the product id that's all that's needed.
Them: Okay. Books are 20% off. Lever is 30% off. No diaries. Product exclusions or diaries. Let me share my screen. Diaries, stationery, writing instruments and refills. I miss you. As well. But yeah. So Libra is 30% off. Yeah.
Me: Is that article the product id?
Them: I don't think. I. Would have been much incentive to back up. Just looking for the old product to do.
Me: I would have picked the German one. Flight car? Yes, it is the product id.
Them: Sorry. What's that? Add article.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So if I share this sheet of you. I mean, I don't know. What is it something you'll do like your AI to.
Me: It's just promotional. Promotional product fee going in. So it had the actual offer in there, didn't it?
Them: Respond. So all of these products in this list are lever 30% or they'll go into a feed.
Me: On the 17th. Right. It's going to take a bit of processing, though. I'll have to disseminate the actual. Which I'll have to create a number of different promotions. First. Which are 30% off and whatever else is on that list. And then set up the feed so it matches those. All right, so we got the two of them. So it's two promotions, and then put the relevant products against each promotion.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Ok?
Them: I haven't done it before, but I would like to learn. So. Yeah, but if you want to do it because you have more experience with it, that's fine. If I can watch you do it, that would be great. Second Then.
Me: It's not a five minute job that Aaron.
Them: That's fine.
Me: Ok, yeah, ping that over and I'll. I'll set something up.
Them: Okay? I will send that a little. What I'll do is just. I'll just reconfirm the email. What? We're doing and send that over as well. And then I was going to put countdown customizers on the search ads as well. But I just need to, like, show Alex what that's going to look like. So it's like, final bit and then we'll have like cross site links, call outs, stretch snippets, etc. So yeah. But. About? It. I will also send you that peak pen, which just covers, like, the Christmas extra campaigns that we're creating, and then the Black Friday stuff.
Me: Right, well, I'm gonna. I'm gonna work on this. Email the handover document he sent over last week.
Them: Okay, that's fine. I have some reporting to do today because for a meeting just to cover, like, the last period. P7. So that's for tomorrow, and then I can do the Bing campaigns.
Me: Ok?
Them: Yeah. That's fine. And then I'm just going to have a little marketing on what's happening with the Black Friday visuals and stuff like that. But yeah.
Me: Well, I've got those translations then for the French, German, Italian.
Them: Thanks. Yeah, it's for gifting and diaries.
Me: Ok, cool. And I'll get the feeds in and do the merchant center promotion, ok?
Them: Cool. And I will adjust your gift in that copy as well. Just a neat little tweaks. Cool. Thank you so much.
Me: Oh. So, yes. And if you could do some a steer on future brand guidelines and stuff. That'd be lovely.
Them: No problem.
Me: Make it easy in the future, wouldn't it?
Them: Yeah. Oh, thanks, peter.
Me: Okie dokie.
Them: We could say.
Me: Have a good one. Bye.
