- 'Me: Hey.'
- 'Them: Hello? Sorry about that. I was just in another meeting.'
- 'Me: Always. Mate. That''s our lives these days, isn''t it? Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Good to meet. I believe you''re based in Southport, are you?'
- 'Me: Yes, I am. Yes.'
- 'Them: Okay. Whereabouts?'
- 'Me: Excuse me. Just by the creme.'
- 'Them: All. Right. Cool. Yeah. My family from southport. And I lived tarleton way.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Growing up. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Oh, got you.'
- 'Them: So do. Bit of family. I''m actually from Chorley now.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay. I was brought up in Churchtown.'
- 'Them: Here, okay?'
- 'Me: And then buggered off to Barry for many years and then came back again. Came
  back to Southport when my mum was alive and me sisters here.'
- 'Them: Cool.'
- 'Me: So. Yeah. Bit flat here. That''s the only problem. Bit different to bury.'
- 'Them: Yeah, very much. It was a bit out of the way, wasn''t it? Until they built
  that new road between Liverpool and Southport is a bit of a nightmare getting anywhere.'
- 'Me: It''s 30. 30 minutes to get on a motorway, which is a pain in the ass.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But it''s what it is.'
- 'Them: I do still have family out there. My auntie lives in Burkdale and my auntie
  lives just next to Hillside Golf Course.'
- 'Me: Oh, nice. Live around there, Caliber. Dale. Bird does really nice.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s been proper cosmopolitanized, if that''s a word.'
- 'Them: I believe. Like, wine bars and, like, craft beer places and all that sort
  of stuff.'
- 'Me: Ferrari''s parked on the road and stuff. Yeah, it''s nice. Very nice.'
- 'Them: Nice. Bit like this office.'
- 'Me: Yes, that''s right. Not as many as there, mate.'
- 'Them: No, not quite. What''s your link with Elite, then? How did you end up working
  with him in the first place?'
- 'Me: I had a message. It''s a weird one. I had a message from a recruitment company.
  And I mean, I''m freelance. I''ve been doing freelance 15 years.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And they said, this isn''t really for you, but they''re desperate to get somebody.
  Would you be interested in talking to them? So that''s exactly what I did. So I
  can''t remember when that was. Now it''s a year and a half, two years ago, something
  like that. I don''t. Recall how long ago it was, but, yeah, basically just to come
  in and help with marketing, online marketing in general.'
- 'Them: Okay? So you''re predominantly doing Google Ads, is that correct?'
- 'Me: I was doing Apple ads as well. I was doing the Facebook to start off with.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: You''re welcome to that. It''s not my cup of tea. Facebook. I do do it. I know
  the mechanics of it. I can operate a campaign, but elites are incredibly dynamic,
  so it was good when it was brought in house because that''s where it needed to be.
  But yeah, so it was trying to get the Google Ads go and us setting up matomo in
  the first place. I did all sorts of bits and pieces, to be honest. I''ll be doing
  ecommerce for 25 years, so there''s a lot of knowledge of a lot of different things
  in my previous background 25 years ago as a programmer, so I''m a bit of a geek
  as well, bit of everything.'
- 'Them: Yeah, okay. Cool. Well, it''s pretty obvious since I''ve come in and obviously
  Google''s off now because of. Well, I don''t know if investment and time spent in
  there at the minute. But I''ve been brought in to try and broaden the channels,
  essentially.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: My background. I was working essentially this role, but for higher Europe.
  So they were selling white goods. And vacuum cleaners. They own Hoover and Candy
  as well. So I was basically doing all their performance marketing.'
- 'Me: Nice.'
- 'Them: Across the three brands. So yeah, I''ve been brought in. We''ve obviously
  got no way when we got no Google Ads on other platform. Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat
  we''ve not really looked at yet. But I think this core predominantly is just appreciate
  you jumping on for half an hour.'
- 'Me: Mate.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Just to get a bit of an understanding and background of what your initial
  thoughts were on when you first started looking at the Google stuff. Just so I don''t
  waste my time doing things, because I know there''s a lot of.'
- 'Me: Good idea.'
- 'Them: Barriers. I don''t want to just like because we want to get YouTube set up
  like immediately. I''ve just done a analysis piece. We''ve just gone with similar
  web to have a look at our competitor stuff. We''re massively over indexing in meta
  ads. I know that already, but from what I can understand. A lot of the competitors
  are already spending a lot of money with YouTube and that just as a crossover, that
  seems like a huge investment that we aren''t doing at the minute. So that''s like
  my main priority is A, data and then B, get us set up on YouTube and a win.'
- 'Me: Okay. I''m surprised. They''re doing a lot on YouTube. My experience was, yes,
  I wanted to get Google Ads going, and we did have it running at one time. We had
  straightforward search campaigns running and they smashed it because no one else
  was doing it. And then Google noticed and they did a policy disapproval because
  it''s gambling site. You have to have a scammer certificate to be able to advertise
  on Google. It''s either that or I can''t remember. The name of it now. There is,
  like, a fundraising certificate that you can get to say that a certain percentage
  of your profits go to charity. You need to display it on the website. I was pushing
  to do that because it would have allowed the search ads to start, but Alex was reticent
  to do it, so that was kind of canned. Tried a few times to get it going with different
  There was a separate elites called now HTML website which just showed the properties
  and sending traffic there that they''re linked over to elite competitions. They
  soon suss it out. They''re very quick on it.'
- 'Them: Back door operations going on.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So from what I understand then, so since June, because. Don''t get me wrong,
  like the competitors, when I''m looking at a chart, it''s majority of it''s coming
  through direct, for obvious reasons. And then you''ve also got meta or paid social
  being the other big one. But Google is coming up as a competitor, so it''s like
  they''ve almost. And when I''m doing my research, whether it''s like in the last.
  I''ve already been here. This is day eight. Yeah, day eight for me now. That''s
  only started.'
- 'Me: You''re looking well on it.'
- 'Them: I''m trying to get there. There''s a lot going on. I''m just trying to piece.'
- 'Me: I''m pleased you''ve come and asked me, mate, though, because you''re going
  to shortcut a lot of things because it might have changed with Google. They might
  be on YouTube because the Google app ads worked. There''s nothing Google can do
  about that. If you do an app promotion on Google, that works.'
- 'Them: Through the play store.'
- 'Me: No, through Google Ads. So you said.'
- 'Them: But pushing people to download the app. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool.'
- 'Me: Yes. That seemed to do really well at the time. The app wasn''t just been second
  version just been launched, and there wasn''t an appetite in the business to push
  people through the app, which seems crazy because you''re actually owning the people
  if they''re coming through the app. So there wasn''t a huge amount of appetite to
  spend a lot of money on the app campaigns, but they''re brilliant. They were absolutely
  brilliant.'
- 'Them: Yeah. From what I can see. Just from my background, because I''m coming from
  an industry that was so competitive. Like we were looking at Yehuva, so Hoover,
  obviously a verb, but then I''m having to compete with that. So Shark, Dyson, are
  all huge companies bidding on Hoover. So I''m used to coming from search campaigns
  that are with the ROAS of, like, 300%. When I''m going into the Meta account and
  I''m going into the Google Ads account, we''re talking in excess of 1000% 10x ROAS.
  So now I''m just like, jesus, why? But the target is 5x. So what I''m trying to
  get my head around is why a not spending more. And I know there''s a content piece
  and we''re like limited to how much we can spend. But also, all of the Google Ads
  were converting and generating a ROAS of like 10x though.'
- 'Me: And you''ll find the app campaigns. If you look for the app campaigns, they
  did very well. The main struggle I had was with attribution.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s making the business understand what attribution was all about. Since
  I''ve left there now, the amount of stuff I''m now doing with AI, the amount of
  data that you have to work with is unbelievable. So the position I wanted to get
  to was looking at lifetime value of a customer. I over say, even if you get over
  three months, And then using that as a CPA target rather than doing a ROAS target
  using the CPA target. But the challenge in that is explain to the business why you''re
  doing that rather than a ROAS target, because it''s an absolute obsession with roas.
  Probably my fault because I introduced it in the first place because I''m ecommerce
  based. That''s where most of my customers are, is ecommerce. But there needs to
  be some sort of idea of CPA and acquiring customers. It''s because you could then
  do a Google app campaign that''s targeted on your customers. I don''t know. You
  still using Rotomo or not, but it''s a great piece of kit. That was. It really was
  a very good piece of kit. If you look at your conversion tracking in Google Ads,
  that''s what it used. It used Matomo to do the tracking.'
- 'Them: Just looking at that this morning. Yeah, it''s not. Matoma got binned off,
  I think, in May because they moved to a platform called Metabase.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: So our devs have been. I don''t know if that''s the actual name of it or
  what.'
- 'Me: Meta base is an analytics package. It''s not a tracking system. It''s a metabase
  is where all the Igor had put over the top of everything to read the database, to
  surface data. It wasn''t a conversion tracking system at all. Matomo could be used
  for conversion tracking and he was very good because you could then use. You could
  then create your customer match file straight. From Matomo and there were been updated
  all the time as well. And they''re key. If you''re going to new customer acquisition
  campaign, then you''re going to need an up to date customer match file. Otherwise
  it''s a crock of shit for targeting new customers. So that''s the challenge you
  got then with straight off if you''ve not got matomo is doing some sort of other
  conversion tracking on Google Ads.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Right.'
- 'Me: And then producing a customer match file of customers. I''m sure they can provide
  that out of Metabase. It wouldn''t be difficult.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So we''ve got that from Clavio.'
- 'Me: Or clario. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah, we''ve got that going in. All right. I mean, I''m still looking at
  that. So I was looking at the.'
- 'Me: Sorry. Was from Clavio. No, you''re quite right. Yeah, that was where the customer
  match file came in. That''s good. Yeah, I did KLV at the front of everything for
  that.'
- 'Them: Annoyingly, they''ve actually. This synchronization expired months ago, so
  I''ve just had to go in and do it. And it''s rebuilding the audiences now, and I''ve
  actually put a few more audiences because I''m keen to get stuff going again.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: In Google. At least try and just get some of the more basic campaigns that
  had a great ROAS target from when you were doing them. But again, the audiences.
  There''s been that synchronization that''s broke the MATOMO conversion value metric.
  It was returning a zero. From months ago, so that was pointless using that now.
  So the Metabase one is working. But again, I don''t know enough about the metabase
  stuff. I''ve previously we''ve used GA4 for our attribution, and I know you don''t
  get a lot. But you can roughly work it out how much you can attribute to relative
  channel. So much going through direct. Now, I don''t know if you. I think when you
  were doing the campaigns, it was all, there was no cookie policy, so we were getting
  100% of the channel traffic. But now.'
- 'Me: That was the beauty of Matomo. If you did matomo. On your own server, then
  there wasn''t an issue with data privacy because you owned it. That was the beauty
  of using Matomo. It wasn''t a third party thing. You could actually get a copy of
  Matomo that sat on your own server. So it operated like it was an analytics package.
  But he wasn''t going off anywhere. It was dropping it straight onto your own stuff.
  So you could actually circumvent a lot of that. So you could, you could collect
  a lot of data that way. I know it was ignored. You know, the actual GDPR to start
  off with. I don''t know whether Tom, it''s a clever guy. I''m not dissing him, but
  it was actually understanding the implications of GDPR and the privacy policy and
  actually contravening it. It was a little bit like the Wild west to start off with.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. I gathered that, but we''ve got Sharon hours the cmo, so she''s
  been brought into oversee a lot of that. And she''s obviously just gone. What on
  earth? You''ve not got a GDPR policy or cookie policy. Get that on before we get
  fined.'
- 'Me: Yep. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, I''ll look at that matomo thing. Have you used a so called Covid day
  before? For AI attribution. Have you heard of it?'
- 'Me: No.'
- 'Them: Right. Just wondering because I use that at the last place. And that was
  for ga. That we were using that as our Google Ads conversion metric as well. Which
  it was given a massive uplift compared to GA4, but there was a cost attributed to
  it.'
- 'Me: Right, okay. Yeah, yeah. And they''re always with me. It will be that we''ve
  talked before. About using some sort of. I can''t remember the name of it. Now we''re
  looking at some sort of attribution modeling. I know that Joe has had a dive into
  it in the past, looking to see whether you could do something. And it. Because it''s
  the old problem, isn''t it? Is how to actually attribute the spend to the channels
  that you''ve got is very, very difficult. So you''ve got that. If you can do that
  attribution, you can see what the actual revenue is per channel, then you can start
  to work out some sort of. Either. We''ll start off with a Roas, but then looking
  at splitting out the new and returning customers to see what the cost per acquisition
  is.'
- 'Them: That''s a big piece. I mean, at the minute. We''re spending so much on meta.
  Just. We''re not going after new customers, we''re just smashing existing customers.
  So I''ve been trying to get to a place in the last sort of like eight days of. What
  each of. So how much? What is the revenue that we''re actually tracking? What is
  coming in through checkout? And then understanding, piece by piece, the channels
  that we''re actually getting. So going through each of the relevant platforms. How
  much is Meta how much is Meta saying that they''re generating how much is Clabio
  saying they''re generating? What''s actually been reported in they.'
- 'Me: They''re all bullshit. Clapio say they take everything. They''re worse than
  Meta. They are worse than mad. One thing I will say about Clavio. The amount they
  pay for Clavio every month is extortionate.'
- 'Them: Are. Yeah, they are. Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: There''s far too much switched on with it.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: You know, like those audiences, you just talk. You have that data. I don''t
  know whether segmentation has been done on the emails. It never was. We''ve just
  sent it out to everybody.'
- 'Them: Well, we''ve got ahead of CRM now as well. So he''s going to be looking at
  all of that. And I mean, I''ve been putting the cost together just on an SMS and
  email basis. It''s absolutely bonkers. So we''re looking at other. We''re looking
  at other things and I mean, I''m coming in and going, bloody hell. But I guess that''s
  why, ultimately, why they''ve brought me into oversee the whole thing rather than
  being.'
- 'Me: I feel you pain. I feel if you imagine that. But I was remote. You know, and
  trying to get a meeting with anyone was a nightmare. You couldn''t actually speak
  to anybody. Because they''re all too busy. So at least you''re in a nice position
  with that. You''re actually sat next to the people doing it. Joe got the same thing
  when he arrived. At least he could actually talk to people. But it''s putting your
  case across for things like lifetime value attribution. Modeling, proper analytics.
  It''s getting through. Alex''s the difficult one.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I mean, to be fair, he has been pretty receptive.'
- 'Me: Good.'
- 'Them: So far. So far, so good. But I''m just trying to get into a position where
  I''m like. Because there''s so much data. I don''t know if you worked with Alex''s
  brother, Dan. Okay. He''s been brought on as like Director of Product. So he''s
  a bit of a go between now from the devs, data art to us. Sort of a project manager,
  but he''s an ed, got an engineering background, so he understands how all the systems
  work. So if I''m going to him, with any questions. I don''t think the questions
  have been put to him before.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: And then RAV in Data Art. He''s been building some of the acquisition dashboards
  because they''ve got their own attribution model. So I''m trying to get better understanding
  of that side.'
- 'Me: That''s good.'
- 'Them: It is a bit of a minefield at the minute, and I don''t understand their attribution
  versus what Google''s doing, how they''re measuring it. But.'
- 'Me: We''re talking straight now. I don''t work with Elite. I''m not going to knock
  anyone. It''s incredible. The thing that they bought. One thing that concerns me
  with data art is the fact that they have everybody''s ear. If you say, I''ve got
  this package that will do this, they''ll say. We''ll write that. Then we''ll write
  it. And that''s another retainer for them. That''s another bit of development work
  when you can just go off the shelf, plug it in and away you go. And it''s a bog
  standard package because what they''re actually saying there is the attribution
  of the channels. You could do that with an off the shelf package.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You don''t need theirs. You know, but from their perspective, they want to
  write their own because they''re going to make some more money out of. They must
  be on an incredible amount of money every month now. It was extortionate when they
  first started, but every time I had a conversation with Igor, I couldn''t put forward
  a case enough for an off the shelf package that would already do what we wanted.
  But he would be speaking to them often enough to say, I can write that. You need
  to do this now. You think? Well, I''m going to. I just said that.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah, but he''s actually saying he can write to you. But you don''t need to
  write it. It already exists. No, no, no. We''ll go with him because they would have
  to integrate it then as well and come up with some reason why they can''t integrate
  it. So I''m coming up. With a conspiracy theory. It''s not like that. You know,
  they built a fantastic platform and they''ve accelerated very quickly considering
  what they had before their relationship. They had before with the guys in India.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That was not great. They were lucky to be able to get out of that.'
- 'Them: About that. Shit.'
- 'Me: It was a shit show. So I understand why. I understand where you''re coming
  from with all of this. But I think I''ve always wanted to be in a position, say,
  let''s attribute this properly, that spending that, that spending that, that spending
  that. What are they bringing in using the same model for all of them. Let''s not
  look at metaphors or, you know, Clavio''s figures. Clavio''s figures are a joke.
  Google Ads figures as well are a joke because there''s multiple touch points in
  all this. So how do you actually attribute those multiple touch points? So it''s
  almost like you need to go right back and say, and this is what. I talked to Ryan
  about this in the past. He''s actually looking. What? This is your revenue. This
  is the total marketing spend. What''s your ratio there between them, your marketing
  efficiency ratio?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Once you''ve got that, then you say, right, well, that''s what you''re reporting
  to the senior management. And then what you want to know is what those individual
  platforms are doing. Is Facebook doing well? Well, everybody sees it, generates
  a lot of money. So they''re going to go, yeah, just give it as much as you want.
  When it was decided to up the up the spend on it, lo and behold, everything went
  up. But how much did it actually do and how efficient could it have been?'
- 'Them: Well, it''s funny you should say that, because yesterday we had. Well, this
  week we''ve had two really shit days. And it''s because we haven''t had the content.
  So my initial, as in the spends just like a fifth of what it was last week because
  we haven''t had the competitions live. That we did last week. Spend has dropped
  and, sorry, revenue just dropped massively. So that to me. It''s sort of giving
  me, like, looking at the individual channel reporting platforms has given me a view
  of. A rough idea as to what it adds up to. And don''t get me wrong, like, weirdly,
  at the start of the year, when I''ve put the numbers together as to what each of
  those channels is saying that they''ve generated versus what the actual number is,
  it was like coming in as, like, 40. 50% over what is actually being reported in
  the back end. Whereas now, sort of the last.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Sort of three or four months. It''s actually not far off. Which is great.
  So something''s being underway, and I am looking at only the paid channels there.
  So they are still over inflated because I''m not a factor in any of the organic
  or any of the direct revenue. But isn''t that far off now?'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, yeah, once Rouse built these reports, I''ll get a much better understanding.
  But I think I just need to. Well, hence why I''m speaking to you. The main challenges
  with the platforms. And with the nature of the business. But from what the competitors
  are doing, how you struggled at the time, getting stuff live, and it was getting
  all the back end back, the backhanded ways of getting stuff approved. I don''t know
  if that is as bad anymore.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: As difficult from what I''m reading. Anyway, I''ve not got anything live
  yet. But from what I understand and how the competitors are doing it, and I''m just
  looking at, like, win a car. Basic search term, and all of our competitors are on
  that.'
- 'Me: Are they really? Okay? Obviously I''m not look for a long time. Well, that
  good news.'
- 'Them: So it is good news that it feels like that''s, like, not a huge opportunity.
  So I''m really excited to get all these other channels live, especially a win as
  well. So, anything else?'
- 'Me: What do you do you have a Google rep?'
- 'Them: Sorry. Go. We do. But I haven''t reached out to him yet because I''m kind
  of like. I don''t want to reach out without having. Without trying to put anything
  live.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Because I want to get some stuff going. Or dis. I mean, to be honest, if
  it gets disapproved, then I''ll be on swim.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But I don''t know what''s your experience with Google reps because. We used
  to spend a lot. And we would be given occasionally be giving those accelerated.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Accelerator program. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Accelerator reps when they''re trying to flog us a load of demand Gen spend.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: But I was running two ad accounts. @ each ad account was spending probably
  about five grand a day.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So when I''m speaking to these reps, literally the only stuff they''d ever
  tell me. And you''re probably going to say exactly the same is this campaign is
  limited by budget. You could potentially add more assets to this PMAX campaign or.'
- 'Me: Lucky recommendations tab.'
- 'Them: Yeah, looking your recommendations tab and if you ever, ever had any questions,
  then just a load of bollocks, basically.'
- 'Me: Yeah, there are some good ones. And you''ve got to be quite pointed in what
  the questions are. I''ve got. I''ve got 12 clients, I''ve got 12 Google reps. I''d
  probably speak to five of them. I just ignore all the others because it''s all bullshit.
  Some of them are quite good on specifics, but a lot of them, it''s just the same
  stuff you say. What do Google want to churn out this week? As you say, you need
  to talk about demand jam, which is the flavor of the month.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: There were a few people who actually were good. Because when you start getting
  into app campaigns, I didn''t know a great deal about them at the time. Now, I think
  you''ve got Firebase installed now, haven''t you? Now, firebase. Well, it was me
  that implemented Apps Flyer in the first place. But I wanted Firebases. Well, because
  that''s how you can do more accurate tracking in Google Ads, using Firebase.'
- 'Them: I''ve seen that.'
- 'Me: Because it will do value. Where there was a deficiency in Apps Flyer, Apps
  Fly was a very good tool, but it''s just getting under the hood of it and again,
  getting the business to believe the data that''s actually producing. Because when
  you''ve got. Because it had Apple ads as well. So the App Store ads, I don''t know
  whether they''re running anymore, but they seem to be very good for new customer
  acquisition. Very, very good. And it was splitting that thing out. It was about
  trying to work out what the spend was on new customers and what the spend was on
  remarketing because you still need to reengage people all the time with all these
  things. But there is a price to pay for new customer acquisition. Again, if you
  have the ltv, you could actually do that. But, yeah, Firebase was a definite if
  that''s been implemented. Awesome. You can link that into Google Ads and track it
  properly. There''s not a great deal needs to be done for an app campaign. I mean,
  to start off, you''re kicking it. Live. Obviously you''re looking at audiences and
  stuff afterwards. That''s where the real fun bit starts to come about. But if they
  can roll straight away. But yeah, if your search campaigns are working, That would
  be incredible. Absolutely incredible. You can switch that on tomorrow.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I know. I know. It''s. It''s crazy, really, But I''m like. Well, I
  keep getting pulled into meetings for a start, so obviously. That happens when you
  first join a business. But I am very keen to get that live asap. I mean, it''s.
  I''m in week two now, and. I''m just like, getting. I''ve sort of got all the data
  together, I''ve asked all the questions I need to do, so now I''m like, right. Let''s
  go.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Obviously speaking to you as well. Is is super helpful understanding what
  the child. But it seems like Google''s moved on because they understand how much
  money is in this industry. Like, I, I can''t believe it. To be fair.'
- 'Me: Yeah, have a look at that. It''s like the Fundraising association or something
  like that. Because they might actually be. Other companies might have joined it
  now, because that was the way to circumvent not having a gambling certificate.'
- 'Them: Well, only you should say that because I don''t know if you follow Elite,
  but they''ve just started this contributions thing where they''re giving back and
  doing the more charitable stuff. Think it''s a bit of a. Bit of a tax break thing
  and it''s more using it as, like, a content. Strategy where there''s, like, walking
  up to people in the street and getting a video of the reaction and, like, for a
  few hundred quid or whatever.'
- 'Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: But. Yeah, that is. That is a very.'
- 'Me: I fucking hate social media. Really do.'
- 'Them: Honestly, some of the numbers that are they''re putting out for socials.
  Like, they did a video last week when I first joined, and it was. Oh, shit. What
  was it now? Oh, YouTube. What was your favorite football team? And they just went
  around all the girls and all the lads in the office and was asking the questions.
  You got half a million?'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Views.'
- 'Me: Really?'
- 'Them: In three days. And. And obviously they''ve got the girls here as well. And
  when they put them front and center on the videos on the screenshot, people are
  clicking through to it. ''s crazy. Really? So they''re from an organic side? That''s
  going mad.'
- "Me: It's funny. When I came away from elite. I was saying to wife, I was kind of\
  \ relieved a little bit. There is that little bit of a moral thing that I'm not\
  \ quite comfortable with. It's something you've got to. You've got to deal with.\
  \ I'm sure you'll find it because you've got a soul. At the end of the day, it's\
  \ the gambling thing. It's seen people coming back time and time again. Someone\
  \ buying \xA3100,000 worth of tickets on the house because you just went, well,\
  \ there's a 75% chance I'm going to win this."
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And he did actually win it. But you go, fucking hell. Yeah, that''s a disease,
  man. It''s an absolute disease. So, anyway.'
- 'Them: I. I get that. But I think from what. From what I understand and what they''re
  telling me, they''ve pulled back off the. I mean, I. I don''t know what it. How
  it was like now versus the last time you were touching, the last time you were on
  the account. When was that? Like June? Was it before June?'
- 'Me: Oh, yeah. Well, before june. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Was it? Okay? When do you think it was?'
- 'Me: I couldn''t tell, mate. I couldn''t tell you. I could. Oh, yes, I could. Let
  me just pull this up.'
- 'Them: Because they''re not going after big spenders anymore. The business strategy
  has changed a lot.'
- 'Me: Right. Oh, you need to. You need to be spreading it out, definitely.'
- 'Them: So they''re going after the small.'
- 'Me: April. April is my last. That was my last month.'
- 'Them: Okay? So there. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, there''s not really anything that''s
  happened on. On Google since. Since then. I think the campaigns ran, then they got.
  Someone made a change in the campaigns, and then they all got paused.'
- 'Me: Right. Well, the problem was on some of the campaigns that and I think it was
  mainly on the search ones that the text on the ads was old. I knew that if I changed
  the text on the ads, it go to, to approval, it goes through the review process and
  it''ll get disapproved. So they were left.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yes.'
- "Me: And despite the fact he's bringing in a 10 times ROAS, that caused great consternation\
  \ in the business. The, the information was incorrect on the ads. If something like,\
  \ you know, I have \xA320 million won, and you go, well, that's not, that's not\
  \ right, is it? He said, yeah, but you. Get in the 10 times Roas on it. Does it\
  \ matter? You know, people are still clicking through it. Yeah, but it's the brand,\
  \ isn't it? Well, it might be the brand. You want to make the money or not make\
  \ the money? So it sounds like someone's just gone in and changed it and it's just\
  \ popped."
- 'Them: They are. That is what? It wasn''t anyone internally. I think someone. They
  got an agency to do it.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: And then the agency came in and made all the changes. And then everything
  got paused. And you couldn''t get the back line.'
- 'Me: Would you turn the right thing? You''re asking the questions first. Because
  why reinvent the wheel?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, you would have been more likely to find that out, having this conversation,
  or better not touch that. Then if they want to keep that revenue going, as you say,
  it was a. It was a great source of revenue.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: A number of times it was with submitted documents to Google to say that and
  it was, it would, there''s, there''s some documents going around from the solicitors
  to say that it''s not gambling because you can have a free entry on it, and that
  that was the case. And I that was what was argued. I would argue that for months
  and months and months and they were just would not play at all. Every now and again
  I get a campaign running and then they spot it and then disapprove it. So it''s
  interesting that so many people now are actually advertising on winner. Car, which
  is quite obviously a gambling phrase. There must be some sort of loophole.'
- 'Them: Well, I''ve been looking through the transparency section today and just
  been looking at a few of their ads, and a lot of them just don''t seem to comply
  with the. Regulations that Google have set, but from the goo. I don''t know if you
  saw the email thread, but Google actually sent back write your headlines, then run
  them through chat GPT and say rate rewrite these headlines so that they comply with
  the gambling regulations that we''ve set. So I''ve, I''ve done that with something
  that Joe did for Meta stuff, but I''m going to be having to do that with Tik Tok
  as well, because Tik Tok, you can''t have any of the Insta win the spin to win stuff.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: He asked end prize. So that''s another thing. But now we''ve got a TikTok
  rep because they''ve clocked on that you can spend. There''s so much money in the
  industry.'
- 'Me: I try with TikTok. They just went, no chance.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so that''s changed. We''ve got TikTok contact now.'
- 'Me: There''s scumbags, all of them. They really are. They just see the money and
  they go, oh, yeah, we don''t have any morals now in.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Just before you set their morals, can I just show you my bank balance?
  And then they''ll be like, all right, yeah, actually, I''m just changing my mind
  on that.'
- 'Me: I think I remember news article one time about I don''t know what it was, it
  was about the sex industry or something and it was to someone high up in the social
  media industry and said we are not the guardians of people''s morals, we just provide
  the contents or display the content. Al.'
- 'Them: Well, funny you should say that. My wife''s. My wife''s a journalist. And
  she reads news for Hits Radio 3 City before they all rebranded. But she''s been
  going to the Southport Inquiry.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay?'
- 'Them: Because we''re in Charlie, and it''s like most people are in Manchester in
  her office. So she just gets sent on, doing a special report. And they had a rep.'
- 'Me: Oh, what a horrible thing to do.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''s horrible. And we''ve got a four year old child story.'
- 'Me: Oh, man.'
- 'Them: Pretty grim. But yeah, so she got sent to the inquiry that''s been going
  on. I think it''s at Liverpool or been listening. And they had a representative
  from Twitter or X, and they''ve sent some absolute. Whoever it is is an absolute
  nut job, as you would expect from Elon. They''re like the most senior person in
  the legal. Basically the legal team at X or whoever''s representing the PR thing.
  And they were backing. They were not backing down on the fact that they were hosting
  this content, because I think he basically watched a load of videos like that showing
  the violence before he went out and did it. And they were still saying that it''s
  not their job to be taking videos down, basically to have this. And even though
  this stuff still happening, it was her in a court of law. I think she was dialed
  in from the states still. Not going against it, and I''m just like, how on earth
  does anything.'
- 'Me: They''re evil. They''re evil, these people.'
- 'Them: Yeah. It''s all money driven.'
- 'Me: And yet if they plot. If they plaster that on the side of a building and they
  post it, they get done straight away, wouldn''t they? What''s the difference?'
- 'Them: But. Yeah, exactly. So it''s crazy. Really? So. Yeah. It just seemed to tie
  in with your opinion of the social work. That was last week. I think that was.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Oh, God.'
- 'Them: Anyway.'
- 'Me: Jesus wax cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, anyway, I''m going to have to shoot because I''ve got to leave
  at 4 and I''ve got some things to wrap up beforehand because my lad needs picking
  up from school, so I don''t want to.'
- 'Me: Right. Okay?'
- 'Them: Leave him in the cold, but massively appreciate your time today.'
- 'Me: Ben.'
- 'Them: It''s good to chat. And yeah, I''m sure things may come or may not, and I
  appreciate you not working on stuff so I''ll only get in touch with mega important,
  but yeah.'
- 'Me: Just ping me somewhere. I said to Joe, this to Joe in the past, you know, I''ve
  got a. I''ve got a connection with Ale. I admire what Alex has done with the business
  and I like the lads there. So, you know, it''s. If you. If you just got a quick
  question, just give us. A shout. You know, I don''t have a problem at all.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Thank you very much. All right, well, cheers for that. Much appreciated.'
- 'Me: No problems. Cheers.'
- 'Them: All right, bye.'
- 'Me: Alex. Bye. Bye. Now.'

- Me: Hey.
- Them: Hello? Sorry about that. I was just in another meeting.
- Me: Always. Mate. That's our lives these days, isn't it? Yeah.
- Them: Yeah. Good to meet. I believe you're based in Southport, are you?
- Me: Yes, I am. Yes.
- Them: Okay. Whereabouts?
- Me: Excuse me. Just by the creme.
- Them: All. Right. Cool. Yeah. My family from southport. And I lived tarleton way.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Growing up. Yeah.
- Me: Oh, got you.
- Them: So do. Bit of family. I'm actually from Chorley now.
- Me: Right. Okay. I was brought up in Churchtown.
- Them: Here, okay?
- Me: And then buggered off to Barry for many years and then came back again. Came back to Southport when my mum was alive and me sisters here.
- Them: Cool.
- Me: So. Yeah. Bit flat here. That's the only problem. Bit different to bury.
- Them: Yeah, very much. It was a bit out of the way, wasn't it? Until they built that new road between Liverpool and Southport is a bit of a nightmare getting anywhere.
- Me: It's 30. 30 minutes to get on a motorway, which is a pain in the ass.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But it's what it is.
- Them: I do still have family out there. My auntie lives in Burkdale and my auntie lives just next to Hillside Golf Course.
- Me: Oh, nice. Live around there, Caliber. Dale. Bird does really nice.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's been proper cosmopolitanized, if that's a word.
- Them: I believe. Like, wine bars and, like, craft beer places and all that sort of stuff.
- Me: Ferrari's parked on the road and stuff. Yeah, it's nice. Very nice.
- Them: Nice. Bit like this office.
- Me: Yes, that's right. Not as many as there, mate.
- Them: No, not quite. What's your link with Elite, then? How did you end up working with him in the first place?
- Me: I had a message. It's a weird one. I had a message from a recruitment company. And I mean, I'm freelance. I've been doing freelance 15 years.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And they said, this isn't really for you, but they're desperate to get somebody. Would you be interested in talking to them? So that's exactly what I did. So I can't remember when that was. Now it's a year and a half, two years ago, something like that. I don't. Recall how long ago it was, but, yeah, basically just to come in and help with marketing, online marketing in general.
- Them: Okay? So you're predominantly doing Google Ads, is that correct?
- Me: I was doing Apple ads as well. I was doing the Facebook to start off with.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: You're welcome to that. It's not my cup of tea. Facebook. I do do it. I know the mechanics of it. I can operate a campaign, but elites are incredibly dynamic, so it was good when it was brought in house because that's where it needed to be. But yeah, so it was trying to get the Google Ads go and us setting up matomo in the first place. I did all sorts of bits and pieces, to be honest. I'll be doing ecommerce for 25 years, so there's a lot of knowledge of a lot of different things in my previous background 25 years ago as a programmer, so I'm a bit of a geek as well, bit of everything.
- Them: Yeah, okay. Cool. Well, it's pretty obvious since I've come in and obviously Google's off now because of. Well, I don't know if investment and time spent in there at the minute. But I've been brought in to try and broaden the channels, essentially.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: My background. I was working essentially this role, but for higher Europe. So they were selling white goods. And vacuum cleaners. They own Hoover and Candy as well. So I was basically doing all their performance marketing.
- Me: Nice.
- Them: Across the three brands. So yeah, I've been brought in. We've obviously got no way when we got no Google Ads on other platform. Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat we've not really looked at yet. But I think this core predominantly is just appreciate you jumping on for half an hour.
- Me: Mate.
- Them: Yeah. Just to get a bit of an understanding and background of what your initial thoughts were on when you first started looking at the Google stuff. Just so I don't waste my time doing things, because I know there's a lot of.
- Me: Good idea.
- Them: Barriers. I don't want to just like because we want to get YouTube set up like immediately. I've just done a analysis piece. We've just gone with similar web to have a look at our competitor stuff. We're massively over indexing in meta ads. I know that already, but from what I can understand. A lot of the competitors are already spending a lot of money with YouTube and that just as a crossover, that seems like a huge investment that we aren't doing at the minute. So that's like my main priority is A, data and then B, get us set up on YouTube and a win.
- Me: Okay. I'm surprised. They're doing a lot on YouTube. My experience was, yes, I wanted to get Google Ads going, and we did have it running at one time. We had straightforward search campaigns running and they smashed it because no one else was doing it. And then Google noticed and they did a policy disapproval because it's gambling site. You have to have a scammer certificate to be able to advertise on Google. It's either that or I can't remember. The name of it now. There is, like, a fundraising certificate that you can get to say that a certain percentage of your profits go to charity. You need to display it on the website. I was pushing to do that because it would have allowed the search ads to start, but Alex was reticent to do it, so that was kind of canned. Tried a few times to get it going with different There was a separate elites called now HTML website which just showed the properties and sending traffic there that they're linked over to elite competitions. They soon suss it out. They're very quick on it.
- Them: Back door operations going on.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So from what I understand then, so since June, because. Don't get me wrong, like the competitors, when I'm looking at a chart, it's majority of it's coming through direct, for obvious reasons. And then you've also got meta or paid social being the other big one. But Google is coming up as a competitor, so it's like they've almost. And when I'm doing my research, whether it's like in the last. I've already been here. This is day eight. Yeah, day eight for me now. That's only started.
- Me: You're looking well on it.
- Them: I'm trying to get there. There's a lot going on. I'm just trying to piece.
- Me: I'm pleased you've come and asked me, mate, though, because you're going to shortcut a lot of things because it might have changed with Google. They might be on YouTube because the Google app ads worked. There's nothing Google can do about that. If you do an app promotion on Google, that works.
- Them: Through the play store.
- Me: No, through Google Ads. So you said.
- Them: But pushing people to download the app. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool.
- Me: Yes. That seemed to do really well at the time. The app wasn't just been second version just been launched, and there wasn't an appetite in the business to push people through the app, which seems crazy because you're actually owning the people if they're coming through the app. So there wasn't a huge amount of appetite to spend a lot of money on the app campaigns, but they're brilliant. They were absolutely brilliant.
- Them: Yeah. From what I can see. Just from my background, because I'm coming from an industry that was so competitive. Like we were looking at Yehuva, so Hoover, obviously a verb, but then I'm having to compete with that. So Shark, Dyson, are all huge companies bidding on Hoover. So I'm used to coming from search campaigns that are with the ROAS of, like, 300%. When I'm going into the Meta account and I'm going into the Google Ads account, we're talking in excess of 1000% 10x ROAS. So now I'm just like, jesus, why? But the target is 5x. So what I'm trying to get my head around is why a not spending more. And I know there's a content piece and we're like limited to how much we can spend. But also, all of the Google Ads were converting and generating a ROAS of like 10x though.
- Me: And you'll find the app campaigns. If you look for the app campaigns, they did very well. The main struggle I had was with attribution.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's making the business understand what attribution was all about. Since I've left there now, the amount of stuff I'm now doing with AI, the amount of data that you have to work with is unbelievable. So the position I wanted to get to was looking at lifetime value of a customer. I over say, even if you get over three months, And then using that as a CPA target rather than doing a ROAS target using the CPA target. But the challenge in that is explain to the business why you're doing that rather than a ROAS target, because it's an absolute obsession with roas. Probably my fault because I introduced it in the first place because I'm ecommerce based. That's where most of my customers are, is ecommerce. But there needs to be some sort of idea of CPA and acquiring customers. It's because you could then do a Google app campaign that's targeted on your customers. I don't know. You still using Rotomo or not, but it's a great piece of kit. That was. It really was a very good piece of kit. If you look at your conversion tracking in Google Ads, that's what it used. It used Matomo to do the tracking.
- Them: Just looking at that this morning. Yeah, it's not. Matoma got binned off, I think, in May because they moved to a platform called Metabase.
- Me: Right.
- Them: So our devs have been. I don't know if that's the actual name of it or what.
- Me: Meta base is an analytics package. It's not a tracking system. It's a metabase is where all the Igor had put over the top of everything to read the database, to surface data. It wasn't a conversion tracking system at all. Matomo could be used for conversion tracking and he was very good because you could then use. You could then create your customer match file straight. From Matomo and there were been updated all the time as well. And they're key. If you're going to new customer acquisition campaign, then you're going to need an up to date customer match file. Otherwise it's a crock of shit for targeting new customers. So that's the challenge you got then with straight off if you've not got matomo is doing some sort of other conversion tracking on Google Ads.
- Them: Yeah. Right.
- Me: And then producing a customer match file of customers. I'm sure they can provide that out of Metabase. It wouldn't be difficult.
- Them: Yeah. So we've got that from Clavio.
- Me: Or clario. Yeah.
- Them: Yeah, we've got that going in. All right. I mean, I'm still looking at that. So I was looking at the.
- Me: Sorry. Was from Clavio. No, you're quite right. Yeah, that was where the customer match file came in. That's good. Yeah, I did KLV at the front of everything for that.
- Them: Annoyingly, they've actually. This synchronization expired months ago, so I've just had to go in and do it. And it's rebuilding the audiences now, and I've actually put a few more audiences because I'm keen to get stuff going again.
- Me: Right.
- Them: In Google. At least try and just get some of the more basic campaigns that had a great ROAS target from when you were doing them. But again, the audiences. There's been that synchronization that's broke the MATOMO conversion value metric. It was returning a zero. From months ago, so that was pointless using that now. So the Metabase one is working. But again, I don't know enough about the metabase stuff. I've previously we've used GA4 for our attribution, and I know you don't get a lot. But you can roughly work it out how much you can attribute to relative channel. So much going through direct. Now, I don't know if you. I think when you were doing the campaigns, it was all, there was no cookie policy, so we were getting 100% of the channel traffic. But now.
- Me: That was the beauty of Matomo. If you did matomo. On your own server, then there wasn't an issue with data privacy because you owned it. That was the beauty of using Matomo. It wasn't a third party thing. You could actually get a copy of Matomo that sat on your own server. So it operated like it was an analytics package. But he wasn't going off anywhere. It was dropping it straight onto your own stuff. So you could actually circumvent a lot of that. So you could, you could collect a lot of data that way. I know it was ignored. You know, the actual GDPR to start off with. I don't know whether Tom, it's a clever guy. I'm not dissing him, but it was actually understanding the implications of GDPR and the privacy policy and actually contravening it. It was a little bit like the Wild west to start off with.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. I gathered that, but we've got Sharon hours the cmo, so she's been brought into oversee a lot of that. And she's obviously just gone. What on earth? You've not got a GDPR policy or cookie policy. Get that on before we get fined.
- Me: Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Okay, I'll look at that matomo thing. Have you used a so called Covid day before? For AI attribution. Have you heard of it?
- Me: No.
- Them: Right. Just wondering because I use that at the last place. And that was for ga. That we were using that as our Google Ads conversion metric as well. Which it was given a massive uplift compared to GA4, but there was a cost attributed to it.
- Me: Right, okay. Yeah, yeah. And they're always with me. It will be that we've talked before. About using some sort of. I can't remember the name of it. Now we're looking at some sort of attribution modeling. I know that Joe has had a dive into it in the past, looking to see whether you could do something. And it. Because it's the old problem, isn't it? Is how to actually attribute the spend to the channels that you've got is very, very difficult. So you've got that. If you can do that attribution, you can see what the actual revenue is per channel, then you can start to work out some sort of. Either. We'll start off with a Roas, but then looking at splitting out the new and returning customers to see what the cost per acquisition is.
- Them: That's a big piece. I mean, at the minute. We're spending so much on meta. Just. We're not going after new customers, we're just smashing existing customers. So I've been trying to get to a place in the last sort of like eight days of. What each of. So how much? What is the revenue that we're actually tracking? What is coming in through checkout? And then understanding, piece by piece, the channels that we're actually getting. So going through each of the relevant platforms. How much is Meta how much is Meta saying that they're generating how much is Clabio saying they're generating? What's actually been reported in they.
- Me: They're all bullshit. Clapio say they take everything. They're worse than Meta. They are worse than mad. One thing I will say about Clavio. The amount they pay for Clavio every month is extortionate.
- Them: Are. Yeah, they are. Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: There's far too much switched on with it.
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: You know, like those audiences, you just talk. You have that data. I don't know whether segmentation has been done on the emails. It never was. We've just sent it out to everybody.
- Them: Well, we've got ahead of CRM now as well. So he's going to be looking at all of that. And I mean, I've been putting the cost together just on an SMS and email basis. It's absolutely bonkers. So we're looking at other. We're looking at other things and I mean, I'm coming in and going, bloody hell. But I guess that's why, ultimately, why they've brought me into oversee the whole thing rather than being.
- Me: I feel you pain. I feel if you imagine that. But I was remote. You know, and trying to get a meeting with anyone was a nightmare. You couldn't actually speak to anybody. Because they're all too busy. So at least you're in a nice position with that. You're actually sat next to the people doing it. Joe got the same thing when he arrived. At least he could actually talk to people. But it's putting your case across for things like lifetime value attribution. Modeling, proper analytics. It's getting through. Alex's the difficult one.
- Them: Yeah. I mean, to be fair, he has been pretty receptive.
- Me: Good.
- Them: So far. So far, so good. But I'm just trying to get into a position where I'm like. Because there's so much data. I don't know if you worked with Alex's brother, Dan. Okay. He's been brought on as like Director of Product. So he's a bit of a go between now from the devs, data art to us. Sort of a project manager, but he's an ed, got an engineering background, so he understands how all the systems work. So if I'm going to him, with any questions. I don't think the questions have been put to him before.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: And then RAV in Data Art. He's been building some of the acquisition dashboards because they've got their own attribution model. So I'm trying to get better understanding of that side.
- Me: That's good.
- Them: It is a bit of a minefield at the minute, and I don't understand their attribution versus what Google's doing, how they're measuring it. But.
- Me: We're talking straight now. I don't work with Elite. I'm not going to knock anyone. It's incredible. The thing that they bought. One thing that concerns me with data art is the fact that they have everybody's ear. If you say, I've got this package that will do this, they'll say. We'll write that. Then we'll write it. And that's another retainer for them. That's another bit of development work when you can just go off the shelf, plug it in and away you go. And it's a bog standard package because what they're actually saying there is the attribution of the channels. You could do that with an off the shelf package.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You don't need theirs. You know, but from their perspective, they want to write their own because they're going to make some more money out of. They must be on an incredible amount of money every month now. It was extortionate when they first started, but every time I had a conversation with Igor, I couldn't put forward a case enough for an off the shelf package that would already do what we wanted. But he would be speaking to them often enough to say, I can write that. You need to do this now. You think? Well, I'm going to. I just said that.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Yeah, but he's actually saying he can write to you. But you don't need to write it. It already exists. No, no, no. We'll go with him because they would have to integrate it then as well and come up with some reason why they can't integrate it. So I'm coming up. With a conspiracy theory. It's not like that. You know, they built a fantastic platform and they've accelerated very quickly considering what they had before their relationship. They had before with the guys in India.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: That was not great. They were lucky to be able to get out of that.
- Them: About that. Shit.
- Me: It was a shit show. So I understand why. I understand where you're coming from with all of this. But I think I've always wanted to be in a position, say, let's attribute this properly, that spending that, that spending that, that spending that. What are they bringing in using the same model for all of them. Let's not look at metaphors or, you know, Clavio's figures. Clavio's figures are a joke. Google Ads figures as well are a joke because there's multiple touch points in all this. So how do you actually attribute those multiple touch points? So it's almost like you need to go right back and say, and this is what. I talked to Ryan about this in the past. He's actually looking. What? This is your revenue. This is the total marketing spend. What's your ratio there between them, your marketing efficiency ratio?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Once you've got that, then you say, right, well, that's what you're reporting to the senior management. And then what you want to know is what those individual platforms are doing. Is Facebook doing well? Well, everybody sees it, generates a lot of money. So they're going to go, yeah, just give it as much as you want. When it was decided to up the up the spend on it, lo and behold, everything went up. But how much did it actually do and how efficient could it have been?
- Them: Well, it's funny you should say that, because yesterday we had. Well, this week we've had two really shit days. And it's because we haven't had the content. So my initial, as in the spends just like a fifth of what it was last week because we haven't had the competitions live. That we did last week. Spend has dropped and, sorry, revenue just dropped massively. So that to me. It's sort of giving me, like, looking at the individual channel reporting platforms has given me a view of. A rough idea as to what it adds up to. And don't get me wrong, like, weirdly, at the start of the year, when I've put the numbers together as to what each of those channels is saying that they've generated versus what the actual number is, it was like coming in as, like, 40. 50% over what is actually being reported in the back end. Whereas now, sort of the last.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Sort of three or four months. It's actually not far off. Which is great. So something's being underway, and I am looking at only the paid channels there. So they are still over inflated because I'm not a factor in any of the organic or any of the direct revenue. But isn't that far off now?
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, yeah, once Rouse built these reports, I'll get a much better understanding. But I think I just need to. Well, hence why I'm speaking to you. The main challenges with the platforms. And with the nature of the business. But from what the competitors are doing, how you struggled at the time, getting stuff live, and it was getting all the back end back, the backhanded ways of getting stuff approved. I don't know if that is as bad anymore.
- Me: Right.
- Them: As difficult from what I'm reading. Anyway, I've not got anything live yet. But from what I understand and how the competitors are doing it, and I'm just looking at, like, win a car. Basic search term, and all of our competitors are on that.
- Me: Are they really? Okay? Obviously I'm not look for a long time. Well, that good news.
- Them: So it is good news that it feels like that's, like, not a huge opportunity. So I'm really excited to get all these other channels live, especially a win as well. So, anything else?
- Me: What do you do you have a Google rep?
- Them: Sorry. Go. We do. But I haven't reached out to him yet because I'm kind of like. I don't want to reach out without having. Without trying to put anything live.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Because I want to get some stuff going. Or dis. I mean, to be honest, if it gets disapproved, then I'll be on swim.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But I don't know what's your experience with Google reps because. We used to spend a lot. And we would be given occasionally be giving those accelerated.
- Me: Yeah. Accelerator program. Yeah.
- Them: Accelerator reps when they're trying to flog us a load of demand Gen spend.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: But I was running two ad accounts. @ each ad account was spending probably about five grand a day.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So when I'm speaking to these reps, literally the only stuff they'd ever tell me. And you're probably going to say exactly the same is this campaign is limited by budget. You could potentially add more assets to this PMAX campaign or.
- Me: Lucky recommendations tab.
- Them: Yeah, looking your recommendations tab and if you ever, ever had any questions, then just a load of bollocks, basically.
- Me: Yeah, there are some good ones. And you've got to be quite pointed in what the questions are. I've got. I've got 12 clients, I've got 12 Google reps. I'd probably speak to five of them. I just ignore all the others because it's all bullshit. Some of them are quite good on specifics, but a lot of them, it's just the same stuff you say. What do Google want to churn out this week? As you say, you need to talk about demand jam, which is the flavor of the month.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
- Me: There were a few people who actually were good. Because when you start getting into app campaigns, I didn't know a great deal about them at the time. Now, I think you've got Firebase installed now, haven't you? Now, firebase. Well, it was me that implemented Apps Flyer in the first place. But I wanted Firebases. Well, because that's how you can do more accurate tracking in Google Ads, using Firebase.
- Them: I've seen that.
- Me: Because it will do value. Where there was a deficiency in Apps Flyer, Apps Fly was a very good tool, but it's just getting under the hood of it and again, getting the business to believe the data that's actually producing. Because when you've got. Because it had Apple ads as well. So the App Store ads, I don't know whether they're running anymore, but they seem to be very good for new customer acquisition. Very, very good. And it was splitting that thing out. It was about trying to work out what the spend was on new customers and what the spend was on remarketing because you still need to reengage people all the time with all these things. But there is a price to pay for new customer acquisition. Again, if you have the ltv, you could actually do that. But, yeah, Firebase was a definite if that's been implemented. Awesome. You can link that into Google Ads and track it properly. There's not a great deal needs to be done for an app campaign. I mean, to start off, you're kicking it. Live. Obviously you're looking at audiences and stuff afterwards. That's where the real fun bit starts to come about. But if they can roll straight away. But yeah, if your search campaigns are working, That would be incredible. Absolutely incredible. You can switch that on tomorrow.
- Them: Yeah. I know. I know. It's. It's crazy, really, But I'm like. Well, I keep getting pulled into meetings for a start, so obviously. That happens when you first join a business. But I am very keen to get that live asap. I mean, it's. I'm in week two now, and. I'm just like, getting. I've sort of got all the data together, I've asked all the questions I need to do, so now I'm like, right. Let's go.
- Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Them: Obviously speaking to you as well. Is is super helpful understanding what the child. But it seems like Google's moved on because they understand how much money is in this industry. Like, I, I can't believe it. To be fair.
- Me: Yeah, have a look at that. It's like the Fundraising association or something like that. Because they might actually be. Other companies might have joined it now, because that was the way to circumvent not having a gambling certificate.
- Them: Well, only you should say that because I don't know if you follow Elite, but they've just started this contributions thing where they're giving back and doing the more charitable stuff. Think it's a bit of a. Bit of a tax break thing and it's more using it as, like, a content. Strategy where there's, like, walking up to people in the street and getting a video of the reaction and, like, for a few hundred quid or whatever.
- Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: But. Yeah, that is. That is a very.
- Me: I fucking hate social media. Really do.
- Them: Honestly, some of the numbers that are they're putting out for socials. Like, they did a video last week when I first joined, and it was. Oh, shit. What was it now? Oh, YouTube. What was your favorite football team? And they just went around all the girls and all the lads in the office and was asking the questions. You got half a million?
- Me: Right.
- Them: Views.
- Me: Really?
- Them: In three days. And. And obviously they've got the girls here as well. And when they put them front and center on the videos on the screenshot, people are clicking through to it. 's crazy. Really? So they're from an organic side? That's going mad.
- Me: It's funny. When I came away from elite. I was saying to wife, I was kind of relieved a little bit. There is that little bit of a moral thing that I'm not quite comfortable with. It's something you've got to. You've got to deal with. I'm sure you'll find it because you've got a soul. At the end of the day, it's the gambling thing. It's seen people coming back time and time again. Someone buying £100,000 worth of tickets on the house because you just went, well, there's a 75% chance I'm going to win this.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And he did actually win it. But you go, fucking hell. Yeah, that's a disease, man. It's an absolute disease. So, anyway.
- Them: I. I get that. But I think from what. From what I understand and what they're telling me, they've pulled back off the. I mean, I. I don't know what it. How it was like now versus the last time you were touching, the last time you were on the account. When was that? Like June? Was it before June?
- Me: Oh, yeah. Well, before june. Yeah.
- Them: Was it? Okay? When do you think it was?
- Me: I couldn't tell, mate. I couldn't tell you. I could. Oh, yes, I could. Let me just pull this up.
- Them: Because they're not going after big spenders anymore. The business strategy has changed a lot.
- Me: Right. Oh, you need to. You need to be spreading it out, definitely.
- Them: So they're going after the small.
- Me: April. April is my last. That was my last month.
- Them: Okay? So there. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, there's not really anything that's happened on. On Google since. Since then. I think the campaigns ran, then they got. Someone made a change in the campaigns, and then they all got paused.
- Me: Right. Well, the problem was on some of the campaigns that and I think it was mainly on the search ones that the text on the ads was old. I knew that if I changed the text on the ads, it go to, to approval, it goes through the review process and it'll get disapproved. So they were left.
- Them: Yeah. Yes.
- Me: And despite the fact he's bringing in a 10 times ROAS, that caused great consternation in the business. The, the information was incorrect on the ads. If something like, you know, I have £20 million won, and you go, well, that's not, that's not right, is it? He said, yeah, but you. Get in the 10 times Roas on it. Does it matter? You know, people are still clicking through it. Yeah, but it's the brand, isn't it? Well, it might be the brand. You want to make the money or not make the money? So it sounds like someone's just gone in and changed it and it's just popped.
- Them: They are. That is what? It wasn't anyone internally. I think someone. They got an agency to do it.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: And then the agency came in and made all the changes. And then everything got paused. And you couldn't get the back line.
- Me: Would you turn the right thing? You're asking the questions first. Because why reinvent the wheel?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, you would have been more likely to find that out, having this conversation, or better not touch that. Then if they want to keep that revenue going, as you say, it was a. It was a great source of revenue.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: A number of times it was with submitted documents to Google to say that and it was, it would, there's, there's some documents going around from the solicitors to say that it's not gambling because you can have a free entry on it, and that that was the case. And I that was what was argued. I would argue that for months and months and months and they were just would not play at all. Every now and again I get a campaign running and then they spot it and then disapprove it. So it's interesting that so many people now are actually advertising on winner. Car, which is quite obviously a gambling phrase. There must be some sort of loophole.
- Them: Well, I've been looking through the transparency section today and just been looking at a few of their ads, and a lot of them just don't seem to comply with the. Regulations that Google have set, but from the goo. I don't know if you saw the email thread, but Google actually sent back write your headlines, then run them through chat GPT and say rate rewrite these headlines so that they comply with the gambling regulations that we've set. So I've, I've done that with something that Joe did for Meta stuff, but I'm going to be having to do that with Tik Tok as well, because Tik Tok, you can't have any of the Insta win the spin to win stuff.
- Me: Right.
- Them: He asked end prize. So that's another thing. But now we've got a TikTok rep because they've clocked on that you can spend. There's so much money in the industry.
- Me: I try with TikTok. They just went, no chance.
- Them: Yeah, so that's changed. We've got TikTok contact now.
- Me: There's scumbags, all of them. They really are. They just see the money and they go, oh, yeah, we don't have any morals now in.
- Them: Yeah. Just before you set their morals, can I just show you my bank balance? And then they'll be like, all right, yeah, actually, I'm just changing my mind on that.
- Me: I think I remember news article one time about I don't know what it was, it was about the sex industry or something and it was to someone high up in the social media industry and said we are not the guardians of people's morals, we just provide the contents or display the content. Al.
- Them: Well, funny you should say that. My wife's. My wife's a journalist. And she reads news for Hits Radio 3 City before they all rebranded. But she's been going to the Southport Inquiry.
- Me: Right. Okay?
- Them: Because we're in Charlie, and it's like most people are in Manchester in her office. So she just gets sent on, doing a special report. And they had a rep.
- Me: Oh, what a horrible thing to do.
- Them: Yeah, it's horrible. And we've got a four year old child story.
- Me: Oh, man.
- Them: Pretty grim. But yeah, so she got sent to the inquiry that's been going on. I think it's at Liverpool or been listening. And they had a representative from Twitter or X, and they've sent some absolute. Whoever it is is an absolute nut job, as you would expect from Elon. They're like the most senior person in the legal. Basically the legal team at X or whoever's representing the PR thing. And they were backing. They were not backing down on the fact that they were hosting this content, because I think he basically watched a load of videos like that showing the violence before he went out and did it. And they were still saying that it's not their job to be taking videos down, basically to have this. And even though this stuff still happening, it was her in a court of law. I think she was dialed in from the states still. Not going against it, and I'm just like, how on earth does anything.
- Me: They're evil. They're evil, these people.
- Them: Yeah. It's all money driven.
- Me: And yet if they plot. If they plaster that on the side of a building and they post it, they get done straight away, wouldn't they? What's the difference?
- Them: But. Yeah, exactly. So it's crazy. Really? So. Yeah. It just seemed to tie in with your opinion of the social work. That was last week. I think that was.
- Me: Yeah. Oh, God.
- Them: Anyway.
- Me: Jesus wax cool.
- Them: Yeah, well, anyway, I'm going to have to shoot because I've got to leave at 4 and I've got some things to wrap up beforehand because my lad needs picking up from school, so I don't want to.
- Me: Right. Okay?
- Them: Leave him in the cold, but massively appreciate your time today.
- Me: Ben.
- Them: It's good to chat. And yeah, I'm sure things may come or may not, and I appreciate you not working on stuff so I'll only get in touch with mega important, but yeah.
- Me: Just ping me somewhere. I said to Joe, this to Joe in the past, you know, I've got a. I've got a connection with Ale. I admire what Alex has done with the business and I like the lads there. So, you know, it's. If you. If you just got a quick question, just give us. A shout. You know, I don't have a problem at all.
- Them: Yeah. Thank you very much. All right, well, cheers for that. Much appreciated.
- Me: No problems. Cheers.
- Them: All right, bye.
- Me: Alex. Bye. Bye. Now.

Me: Hey.
Them: Hello? Sorry about that. I was just in another meeting.
Me: Always. Mate. That's our lives these days, isn't it? Yeah.
Them: Yeah. Good to meet. I believe you're based in Southport, are you?
Me: Yes, I am. Yes.
Them: Okay. Whereabouts?
Me: Excuse me. Just by the creme.
Them: All. Right. Cool. Yeah. My family from southport. And I lived tarleton way.
Me: Okay?
Them: Growing up. Yeah.
Me: Oh, got you.
Them: So do. Bit of family. I'm actually from Chorley now.
Me: Right. Okay. I was brought up in Churchtown.
Them: Here, okay?
Me: And then buggered off to Barry for many years and then came back again. Came back to Southport when my mum was alive and me sisters here.
Them: Cool.
Me: So. Yeah. Bit flat here. That's the only problem. Bit different to bury.
Them: Yeah, very much. It was a bit out of the way, wasn't it? Until they built that new road between Liverpool and Southport is a bit of a nightmare getting anywhere.
Me: It's 30. 30 minutes to get on a motorway, which is a pain in the ass.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But it's what it is.
Them: I do still have family out there. My auntie lives in Burkdale and my auntie lives just next to Hillside Golf Course.
Me: Oh, nice. Live around there, Caliber. Dale. Bird does really nice.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's been proper cosmopolitanized, if that's a word.
Them: I believe. Like, wine bars and, like, craft beer places and all that sort of stuff.
Me: Ferrari's parked on the road and stuff. Yeah, it's nice. Very nice.
Them: Nice. Bit like this office.
Me: Yes, that's right. Not as many as there, mate.
Them: No, not quite. What's your link with Elite, then? How did you end up working with him in the first place?
Me: I had a message. It's a weird one. I had a message from a recruitment company. And I mean, I'm freelance. I've been doing freelance 15 years.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And they said, this isn't really for you, but they're desperate to get somebody. Would you be interested in talking to them? So that's exactly what I did. So I can't remember when that was. Now it's a year and a half, two years ago, something like that. I don't. Recall how long ago it was, but, yeah, basically just to come in and help with marketing, online marketing in general.
Them: Okay? So you're predominantly doing Google Ads, is that correct?
Me: I was doing Apple ads as well. I was doing the Facebook to start off with.
Them: Okay?
Me: You're welcome to that. It's not my cup of tea. Facebook. I do do it. I know the mechanics of it. I can operate a campaign, but elites are incredibly dynamic, so it was good when it was brought in house because that's where it needed to be. But yeah, so it was trying to get the Google Ads go and us setting up matomo in the first place. I did all sorts of bits and pieces, to be honest. I'll be doing ecommerce for 25 years, so there's a lot of knowledge of a lot of different things in my previous background 25 years ago as a programmer, so I'm a bit of a geek as well, bit of everything.
Them: Yeah, okay. Cool. Well, it's pretty obvious since I've come in and obviously Google's off now because of. Well, I don't know if investment and time spent in there at the minute. But I've been brought in to try and broaden the channels, essentially.
Me: Okay?
Them: My background. I was working essentially this role, but for higher Europe. So they were selling white goods. And vacuum cleaners. They own Hoover and Candy as well. So I was basically doing all their performance marketing.
Me: Nice.
Them: Across the three brands. So yeah, I've been brought in. We've obviously got no way when we got no Google Ads on other platform. Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat we've not really looked at yet. But I think this core predominantly is just appreciate you jumping on for half an hour.
Me: Mate.
Them: Yeah. Just to get a bit of an understanding and background of what your initial thoughts were on when you first started looking at the Google stuff. Just so I don't waste my time doing things, because I know there's a lot of.
Me: Good idea.
Them: Barriers. I don't want to just like because we want to get YouTube set up like immediately. I've just done a analysis piece. We've just gone with similar web to have a look at our competitor stuff. We're massively over indexing in meta ads. I know that already, but from what I can understand. A lot of the competitors are already spending a lot of money with YouTube and that just as a crossover, that seems like a huge investment that we aren't doing at the minute. So that's like my main priority is A, data and then B, get us set up on YouTube and a win.
Me: Okay. I'm surprised. They're doing a lot on YouTube. My experience was, yes, I wanted to get Google Ads going, and we did have it running at one time. We had straightforward search campaigns running and they smashed it because no one else was doing it. And then Google noticed and they did a policy disapproval because it's gambling site. You have to have a scammer certificate to be able to advertise on Google. It's either that or I can't remember. The name of it now. There is, like, a fundraising certificate that you can get to say that a certain percentage of your profits go to charity. You need to display it on the website. I was pushing to do that because it would have allowed the search ads to start, but Alex was reticent to do it, so that was kind of canned. Tried a few times to get it going with different There was a separate elites called now HTML website which just showed the properties and sending traffic there that they're linked over to elite competitions. They soon suss it out. They're very quick on it.
Them: Back door operations going on.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So from what I understand then, so since June, because. Don't get me wrong, like the competitors, when I'm looking at a chart, it's majority of it's coming through direct, for obvious reasons. And then you've also got meta or paid social being the other big one. But Google is coming up as a competitor, so it's like they've almost. And when I'm doing my research, whether it's like in the last. I've already been here. This is day eight. Yeah, day eight for me now. That's only started.
Me: You're looking well on it.
Them: I'm trying to get there. There's a lot going on. I'm just trying to piece.
Me: I'm pleased you've come and asked me, mate, though, because you're going to shortcut a lot of things because it might have changed with Google. They might be on YouTube because the Google app ads worked. There's nothing Google can do about that. If you do an app promotion on Google, that works.
Them: Through the play store.
Me: No, through Google Ads. So you said.
Them: But pushing people to download the app. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool.
Me: Yes. That seemed to do really well at the time. The app wasn't just been second version just been launched, and there wasn't an appetite in the business to push people through the app, which seems crazy because you're actually owning the people if they're coming through the app. So there wasn't a huge amount of appetite to spend a lot of money on the app campaigns, but they're brilliant. They were absolutely brilliant.
Them: Yeah. From what I can see. Just from my background, because I'm coming from an industry that was so competitive. Like we were looking at Yehuva, so Hoover, obviously a verb, but then I'm having to compete with that. So Shark, Dyson, are all huge companies bidding on Hoover. So I'm used to coming from search campaigns that are with the ROAS of, like, 300%. When I'm going into the Meta account and I'm going into the Google Ads account, we're talking in excess of 1000% 10x ROAS. So now I'm just like, jesus, why? But the target is 5x. So what I'm trying to get my head around is why a not spending more. And I know there's a content piece and we're like limited to how much we can spend. But also, all of the Google Ads were converting and generating a ROAS of like 10x though.
Me: And you'll find the app campaigns. If you look for the app campaigns, they did very well. The main struggle I had was with attribution.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's making the business understand what attribution was all about. Since I've left there now, the amount of stuff I'm now doing with AI, the amount of data that you have to work with is unbelievable. So the position I wanted to get to was looking at lifetime value of a customer. I over say, even if you get over three months, And then using that as a CPA target rather than doing a ROAS target using the CPA target. But the challenge in that is explain to the business why you're doing that rather than a ROAS target, because it's an absolute obsession with roas. Probably my fault because I introduced it in the first place because I'm ecommerce based. That's where most of my customers are, is ecommerce. But there needs to be some sort of idea of CPA and acquiring customers. It's because you could then do a Google app campaign that's targeted on your customers. I don't know. You still using Rotomo or not, but it's a great piece of kit. That was. It really was a very good piece of kit. If you look at your conversion tracking in Google Ads, that's what it used. It used Matomo to do the tracking.
Them: Just looking at that this morning. Yeah, it's not. Matoma got binned off, I think, in May because they moved to a platform called Metabase.
Me: Right.
Them: So our devs have been. I don't know if that's the actual name of it or what.
Me: Meta base is an analytics package. It's not a tracking system. It's a metabase is where all the Igor had put over the top of everything to read the database, to surface data. It wasn't a conversion tracking system at all. Matomo could be used for conversion tracking and he was very good because you could then use. You could then create your customer match file straight. From Matomo and there were been updated all the time as well. And they're key. If you're going to new customer acquisition campaign, then you're going to need an up to date customer match file. Otherwise it's a crock of shit for targeting new customers. So that's the challenge you got then with straight off if you've not got matomo is doing some sort of other conversion tracking on Google Ads.
Them: Yeah. Right.
Me: And then producing a customer match file of customers. I'm sure they can provide that out of Metabase. It wouldn't be difficult.
Them: Yeah. So we've got that from Clavio.
Me: Or clario. Yeah.
Them: Yeah, we've got that going in. All right. I mean, I'm still looking at that. So I was looking at the.
Me: Sorry. Was from Clavio. No, you're quite right. Yeah, that was where the customer match file came in. That's good. Yeah, I did KLV at the front of everything for that.
Them: Annoyingly, they've actually. This synchronization expired months ago, so I've just had to go in and do it. And it's rebuilding the audiences now, and I've actually put a few more audiences because I'm keen to get stuff going again.
Me: Right.
Them: In Google. At least try and just get some of the more basic campaigns that had a great ROAS target from when you were doing them. But again, the audiences. There's been that synchronization that's broke the MATOMO conversion value metric. It was returning a zero. From months ago, so that was pointless using that now. So the Metabase one is working. But again, I don't know enough about the metabase stuff. I've previously we've used GA4 for our attribution, and I know you don't get a lot. But you can roughly work it out how much you can attribute to relative channel. So much going through direct. Now, I don't know if you. I think when you were doing the campaigns, it was all, there was no cookie policy, so we were getting 100% of the channel traffic. But now.
Me: That was the beauty of Matomo. If you did matomo. On your own server, then there wasn't an issue with data privacy because you owned it. That was the beauty of using Matomo. It wasn't a third party thing. You could actually get a copy of Matomo that sat on your own server. So it operated like it was an analytics package. But he wasn't going off anywhere. It was dropping it straight onto your own stuff. So you could actually circumvent a lot of that. So you could, you could collect a lot of data that way. I know it was ignored. You know, the actual GDPR to start off with. I don't know whether Tom, it's a clever guy. I'm not dissing him, but it was actually understanding the implications of GDPR and the privacy policy and actually contravening it. It was a little bit like the Wild west to start off with.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I gathered that, but we've got Sharon hours the cmo, so she's been brought into oversee a lot of that. And she's obviously just gone. What on earth? You've not got a GDPR policy or cookie policy. Get that on before we get fined.
Me: Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Okay, I'll look at that matomo thing. Have you used a so called Covid day before? For AI attribution. Have you heard of it?
Me: No.
Them: Right. Just wondering because I use that at the last place. And that was for ga. That we were using that as our Google Ads conversion metric as well. Which it was given a massive uplift compared to GA4, but there was a cost attributed to it.
Me: Right, okay. Yeah, yeah. And they're always with me. It will be that we've talked before. About using some sort of. I can't remember the name of it. Now we're looking at some sort of attribution modeling. I know that Joe has had a dive into it in the past, looking to see whether you could do something. And it. Because it's the old problem, isn't it? Is how to actually attribute the spend to the channels that you've got is very, very difficult. So you've got that. If you can do that attribution, you can see what the actual revenue is per channel, then you can start to work out some sort of. Either. We'll start off with a Roas, but then looking at splitting out the new and returning customers to see what the cost per acquisition is.
Them: That's a big piece. I mean, at the minute. We're spending so much on meta. Just. We're not going after new customers, we're just smashing existing customers. So I've been trying to get to a place in the last sort of like eight days of. What each of. So how much? What is the revenue that we're actually tracking? What is coming in through checkout? And then understanding, piece by piece, the channels that we're actually getting. So going through each of the relevant platforms. How much is Meta how much is Meta saying that they're generating how much is Clabio saying they're generating? What's actually been reported in they.
Me: They're all bullshit. Clapio say they take everything. They're worse than Meta. They are worse than mad. One thing I will say about Clavio. The amount they pay for Clavio every month is extortionate.
Them: Are. Yeah, they are. Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: There's far too much switched on with it.
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: You know, like those audiences, you just talk. You have that data. I don't know whether segmentation has been done on the emails. It never was. We've just sent it out to everybody.
Them: Well, we've got ahead of CRM now as well. So he's going to be looking at all of that. And I mean, I've been putting the cost together just on an SMS and email basis. It's absolutely bonkers. So we're looking at other. We're looking at other things and I mean, I'm coming in and going, bloody hell. But I guess that's why, ultimately, why they've brought me into oversee the whole thing rather than being.
Me: I feel you pain. I feel if you imagine that. But I was remote. You know, and trying to get a meeting with anyone was a nightmare. You couldn't actually speak to anybody. Because they're all too busy. So at least you're in a nice position with that. You're actually sat next to the people doing it. Joe got the same thing when he arrived. At least he could actually talk to people. But it's putting your case across for things like lifetime value attribution. Modeling, proper analytics. It's getting through. Alex's the difficult one.
Them: Yeah. I mean, to be fair, he has been pretty receptive.
Me: Good.
Them: So far. So far, so good. But I'm just trying to get into a position where I'm like. Because there's so much data. I don't know if you worked with Alex's brother, Dan. Okay. He's been brought on as like Director of Product. So he's a bit of a go between now from the devs, data art to us. Sort of a project manager, but he's an ed, got an engineering background, so he understands how all the systems work. So if I'm going to him, with any questions. I don't think the questions have been put to him before.
Me: Okay?
Them: And then RAV in Data Art. He's been building some of the acquisition dashboards because they've got their own attribution model. So I'm trying to get better understanding of that side.
Me: That's good.
Them: It is a bit of a minefield at the minute, and I don't understand their attribution versus what Google's doing, how they're measuring it. But.
Me: We're talking straight now. I don't work with Elite. I'm not going to knock anyone. It's incredible. The thing that they bought. One thing that concerns me with data art is the fact that they have everybody's ear. If you say, I've got this package that will do this, they'll say. We'll write that. Then we'll write it. And that's another retainer for them. That's another bit of development work when you can just go off the shelf, plug it in and away you go. And it's a bog standard package because what they're actually saying there is the attribution of the channels. You could do that with an off the shelf package.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You don't need theirs. You know, but from their perspective, they want to write their own because they're going to make some more money out of. They must be on an incredible amount of money every month now. It was extortionate when they first started, but every time I had a conversation with Igor, I couldn't put forward a case enough for an off the shelf package that would already do what we wanted. But he would be speaking to them often enough to say, I can write that. You need to do this now. You think? Well, I'm going to. I just said that.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Yeah, but he's actually saying he can write to you. But you don't need to write it. It already exists. No, no, no. We'll go with him because they would have to integrate it then as well and come up with some reason why they can't integrate it. So I'm coming up. With a conspiracy theory. It's not like that. You know, they built a fantastic platform and they've accelerated very quickly considering what they had before their relationship. They had before with the guys in India.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That was not great. They were lucky to be able to get out of that.
Them: About that. Shit.
Me: It was a shit show. So I understand why. I understand where you're coming from with all of this. But I think I've always wanted to be in a position, say, let's attribute this properly, that spending that, that spending that, that spending that. What are they bringing in using the same model for all of them. Let's not look at metaphors or, you know, Clavio's figures. Clavio's figures are a joke. Google Ads figures as well are a joke because there's multiple touch points in all this. So how do you actually attribute those multiple touch points? So it's almost like you need to go right back and say, and this is what. I talked to Ryan about this in the past. He's actually looking. What? This is your revenue. This is the total marketing spend. What's your ratio there between them, your marketing efficiency ratio?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Once you've got that, then you say, right, well, that's what you're reporting to the senior management. And then what you want to know is what those individual platforms are doing. Is Facebook doing well? Well, everybody sees it, generates a lot of money. So they're going to go, yeah, just give it as much as you want. When it was decided to up the up the spend on it, lo and behold, everything went up. But how much did it actually do and how efficient could it have been?
Them: Well, it's funny you should say that, because yesterday we had. Well, this week we've had two really shit days. And it's because we haven't had the content. So my initial, as in the spends just like a fifth of what it was last week because we haven't had the competitions live. That we did last week. Spend has dropped and, sorry, revenue just dropped massively. So that to me. It's sort of giving me, like, looking at the individual channel reporting platforms has given me a view of. A rough idea as to what it adds up to. And don't get me wrong, like, weirdly, at the start of the year, when I've put the numbers together as to what each of those channels is saying that they've generated versus what the actual number is, it was like coming in as, like, 40. 50% over what is actually being reported in the back end. Whereas now, sort of the last.
Me: Right.
Them: Sort of three or four months. It's actually not far off. Which is great. So something's being underway, and I am looking at only the paid channels there. So they are still over inflated because I'm not a factor in any of the organic or any of the direct revenue. But isn't that far off now?
Me: Yeah.
Them: So, yeah, once Rouse built these reports, I'll get a much better understanding. But I think I just need to. Well, hence why I'm speaking to you. The main challenges with the platforms. And with the nature of the business. But from what the competitors are doing, how you struggled at the time, getting stuff live, and it was getting all the back end back, the backhanded ways of getting stuff approved. I don't know if that is as bad anymore.
Me: Right.
Them: As difficult from what I'm reading. Anyway, I've not got anything live yet. But from what I understand and how the competitors are doing it, and I'm just looking at, like, win a car. Basic search term, and all of our competitors are on that.
Me: Are they really? Okay? Obviously I'm not look for a long time. Well, that good news.
Them: So it is good news that it feels like that's, like, not a huge opportunity. So I'm really excited to get all these other channels live, especially a win as well. So, anything else?
Me: What do you do you have a Google rep?
Them: Sorry. Go. We do. But I haven't reached out to him yet because I'm kind of like. I don't want to reach out without having. Without trying to put anything live.
Me: Right.
Them: Because I want to get some stuff going. Or dis. I mean, to be honest, if it gets disapproved, then I'll be on swim.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But I don't know what's your experience with Google reps because. We used to spend a lot. And we would be given occasionally be giving those accelerated.
Me: Yeah. Accelerator program. Yeah.
Them: Accelerator reps when they're trying to flog us a load of demand Gen spend.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But I was running two ad accounts. @ each ad account was spending probably about five grand a day.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So when I'm speaking to these reps, literally the only stuff they'd ever tell me. And you're probably going to say exactly the same is this campaign is limited by budget. You could potentially add more assets to this PMAX campaign or.
Me: Lucky recommendations tab.
Them: Yeah, looking your recommendations tab and if you ever, ever had any questions, then just a load of bollocks, basically.
Me: Yeah, there are some good ones. And you've got to be quite pointed in what the questions are. I've got. I've got 12 clients, I've got 12 Google reps. I'd probably speak to five of them. I just ignore all the others because it's all bullshit. Some of them are quite good on specifics, but a lot of them, it's just the same stuff you say. What do Google want to churn out this week? As you say, you need to talk about demand jam, which is the flavor of the month.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.
Me: There were a few people who actually were good. Because when you start getting into app campaigns, I didn't know a great deal about them at the time. Now, I think you've got Firebase installed now, haven't you? Now, firebase. Well, it was me that implemented Apps Flyer in the first place. But I wanted Firebases. Well, because that's how you can do more accurate tracking in Google Ads, using Firebase.
Them: I've seen that.
Me: Because it will do value. Where there was a deficiency in Apps Flyer, Apps Fly was a very good tool, but it's just getting under the hood of it and again, getting the business to believe the data that's actually producing. Because when you've got. Because it had Apple ads as well. So the App Store ads, I don't know whether they're running anymore, but they seem to be very good for new customer acquisition. Very, very good. And it was splitting that thing out. It was about trying to work out what the spend was on new customers and what the spend was on remarketing because you still need to reengage people all the time with all these things. But there is a price to pay for new customer acquisition. Again, if you have the ltv, you could actually do that. But, yeah, Firebase was a definite if that's been implemented. Awesome. You can link that into Google Ads and track it properly. There's not a great deal needs to be done for an app campaign. I mean, to start off, you're kicking it. Live. Obviously you're looking at audiences and stuff afterwards. That's where the real fun bit starts to come about. But if they can roll straight away. But yeah, if your search campaigns are working, That would be incredible. Absolutely incredible. You can switch that on tomorrow.
Them: Yeah. I know. I know. It's. It's crazy, really, But I'm like. Well, I keep getting pulled into meetings for a start, so obviously. That happens when you first join a business. But I am very keen to get that live asap. I mean, it's. I'm in week two now, and. I'm just like, getting. I've sort of got all the data together, I've asked all the questions I need to do, so now I'm like, right. Let's go.
Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Them: Obviously speaking to you as well. Is is super helpful understanding what the child. But it seems like Google's moved on because they understand how much money is in this industry. Like, I, I can't believe it. To be fair.
Me: Yeah, have a look at that. It's like the Fundraising association or something like that. Because they might actually be. Other companies might have joined it now, because that was the way to circumvent not having a gambling certificate.
Them: Well, only you should say that because I don't know if you follow Elite, but they've just started this contributions thing where they're giving back and doing the more charitable stuff. Think it's a bit of a. Bit of a tax break thing and it's more using it as, like, a content. Strategy where there's, like, walking up to people in the street and getting a video of the reaction and, like, for a few hundred quid or whatever.
Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: But. Yeah, that is. That is a very.
Me: I fucking hate social media. Really do.
Them: Honestly, some of the numbers that are they're putting out for socials. Like, they did a video last week when I first joined, and it was. Oh, shit. What was it now? Oh, YouTube. What was your favorite football team? And they just went around all the girls and all the lads in the office and was asking the questions. You got half a million?
Me: Right.
Them: Views.
Me: Really?
Them: In three days. And. And obviously they've got the girls here as well. And when they put them front and center on the videos on the screenshot, people are clicking through to it. 's crazy. Really? So they're from an organic side? That's going mad.
Me: It's funny. When I came away from elite. I was saying to wife, I was kind of relieved a little bit. There is that little bit of a moral thing that I'm not quite comfortable with. It's something you've got to. You've got to deal with. I'm sure you'll find it because you've got a soul. At the end of the day, it's the gambling thing. It's seen people coming back time and time again. Someone buying £100,000 worth of tickets on the house because you just went, well, there's a 75% chance I'm going to win this.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And he did actually win it. But you go, fucking hell. Yeah, that's a disease, man. It's an absolute disease. So, anyway.
Them: I. I get that. But I think from what. From what I understand and what they're telling me, they've pulled back off the. I mean, I. I don't know what it. How it was like now versus the last time you were touching, the last time you were on the account. When was that? Like June? Was it before June?
Me: Oh, yeah. Well, before june. Yeah.
Them: Was it? Okay? When do you think it was?
Me: I couldn't tell, mate. I couldn't tell you. I could. Oh, yes, I could. Let me just pull this up.
Them: Because they're not going after big spenders anymore. The business strategy has changed a lot.
Me: Right. Oh, you need to. You need to be spreading it out, definitely.
Them: So they're going after the small.
Me: April. April is my last. That was my last month.
Them: Okay? So there. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, there's not really anything that's happened on. On Google since. Since then. I think the campaigns ran, then they got. Someone made a change in the campaigns, and then they all got paused.
Me: Right. Well, the problem was on some of the campaigns that and I think it was mainly on the search ones that the text on the ads was old. I knew that if I changed the text on the ads, it go to, to approval, it goes through the review process and it'll get disapproved. So they were left.
Them: Yeah. Yes.
Me: And despite the fact he's bringing in a 10 times ROAS, that caused great consternation in the business. The, the information was incorrect on the ads. If something like, you know, I have £20 million won, and you go, well, that's not, that's not right, is it? He said, yeah, but you. Get in the 10 times Roas on it. Does it matter? You know, people are still clicking through it. Yeah, but it's the brand, isn't it? Well, it might be the brand. You want to make the money or not make the money? So it sounds like someone's just gone in and changed it and it's just popped.
Them: They are. That is what? It wasn't anyone internally. I think someone. They got an agency to do it.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And then the agency came in and made all the changes. And then everything got paused. And you couldn't get the back line.
Me: Would you turn the right thing? You're asking the questions first. Because why reinvent the wheel?
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, you would have been more likely to find that out, having this conversation, or better not touch that. Then if they want to keep that revenue going, as you say, it was a. It was a great source of revenue.
Them: Yeah.
Me: A number of times it was with submitted documents to Google to say that and it was, it would, there's, there's some documents going around from the solicitors to say that it's not gambling because you can have a free entry on it, and that that was the case. And I that was what was argued. I would argue that for months and months and months and they were just would not play at all. Every now and again I get a campaign running and then they spot it and then disapprove it. So it's interesting that so many people now are actually advertising on winner. Car, which is quite obviously a gambling phrase. There must be some sort of loophole.
Them: Well, I've been looking through the transparency section today and just been looking at a few of their ads, and a lot of them just don't seem to comply with the. Regulations that Google have set, but from the goo. I don't know if you saw the email thread, but Google actually sent back write your headlines, then run them through chat GPT and say rate rewrite these headlines so that they comply with the gambling regulations that we've set. So I've, I've done that with something that Joe did for Meta stuff, but I'm going to be having to do that with Tik Tok as well, because Tik Tok, you can't have any of the Insta win the spin to win stuff.
Me: Right.
Them: He asked end prize. So that's another thing. But now we've got a TikTok rep because they've clocked on that you can spend. There's so much money in the industry.
Me: I try with TikTok. They just went, no chance.
Them: Yeah, so that's changed. We've got TikTok contact now.
Me: There's scumbags, all of them. They really are. They just see the money and they go, oh, yeah, we don't have any morals now in.
Them: Yeah. Just before you set their morals, can I just show you my bank balance? And then they'll be like, all right, yeah, actually, I'm just changing my mind on that.
Me: I think I remember news article one time about I don't know what it was, it was about the sex industry or something and it was to someone high up in the social media industry and said we are not the guardians of people's morals, we just provide the contents or display the content. Al.
Them: Well, funny you should say that. My wife's. My wife's a journalist. And she reads news for Hits Radio 3 City before they all rebranded. But she's been going to the Southport Inquiry.
Me: Right. Okay?
Them: Because we're in Charlie, and it's like most people are in Manchester in her office. So she just gets sent on, doing a special report. And they had a rep.
Me: Oh, what a horrible thing to do.
Them: Yeah, it's horrible. And we've got a four year old child story.
Me: Oh, man.
Them: Pretty grim. But yeah, so she got sent to the inquiry that's been going on. I think it's at Liverpool or been listening. And they had a representative from Twitter or X, and they've sent some absolute. Whoever it is is an absolute nut job, as you would expect from Elon. They're like the most senior person in the legal. Basically the legal team at X or whoever's representing the PR thing. And they were backing. They were not backing down on the fact that they were hosting this content, because I think he basically watched a load of videos like that showing the violence before he went out and did it. And they were still saying that it's not their job to be taking videos down, basically to have this. And even though this stuff still happening, it was her in a court of law. I think she was dialed in from the states still. Not going against it, and I'm just like, how on earth does anything.
Me: They're evil. They're evil, these people.
Them: Yeah. It's all money driven.
Me: And yet if they plot. If they plaster that on the side of a building and they post it, they get done straight away, wouldn't they? What's the difference?
Them: But. Yeah, exactly. So it's crazy. Really? So. Yeah. It just seemed to tie in with your opinion of the social work. That was last week. I think that was.
Me: Yeah. Oh, God.
Them: Anyway.
Me: Jesus wax cool.
