## Executive Summary

- Reviewing Google Ads budget optimization for international campaigns
- Analyzing campaign performance and conversion metrics
- Proposing strategic budget reductions based on conversion data

## Strategic Decisions

- Reduce campaign budgets by up to 95% for low-performing segments
- Maintain full budget for high-performing UAE campaigns
- Potentially adjust CPA targets to naturally reduce spending

## Key Learnings

- Campaigns in July and August performed better than current period
- Conversions are now more meaningful and trackable
- Budget allocation needs careful optimization based on actual performance

## Transcript

Me: Thank you for the different view today as well.
Them: Yeah, you're welcome.
Me: How's it going, mate?
Them: Yeah, not bad. I'm guessing you've only got five minutes.
Me: I. Could do till 11:30. I'm just a bit all over the place. So go for it.
Them: Okay? Yeah, no, just wanted to just catch up and see how we can put. Put the budgets sort of back on track. It seems you sent me a link the other day, but I've not got. A says provership of my address, okay?
Me: Really?
Them: So I think it's a my end problem, not a your own problem. So I was just wondering, because things seem to be working quite well in July, August. You know, it is the way we can sort of revert back to that. Exactly. Or is it? Or no.
Me: Well, now, what I've done is I've looked at. I'll share my screen with you.
Them: Yeah.
Me: This is what I sent over because it's quite detailed. So this was looking at August. Is that big enough?
Them: Can you go full screen or zoom slightly?
Me: How's that?
Them: Yeah, that's better. Yeah, Yeah.
Me: Okay, so I've looked at October, and then the target for August was 27k. So we need to reduce it by 12,600.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And then. So this is the proposal based upon our old friend's conversion. So all I can do is look at the conversions that are on there now. The conversions that are on the Google Ads system are relevant. It's not as though they're nothing. They're not just form fillings in anymore. They have actually achieved something. So I think it would be valid to actually use them as an indicator of whether to increase something. So instead of so I've got an action here of these reductions rather than pause campaigns. I've reduced it by 95%. So they just work? They're just ticking over. So there's the rationale on the right hand side. So these have all had no conversions? So things like landscape design and so on. These are 90% is based upon the fact they've had very few conversions.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And then it kind of increases all the way along. So we get to the keepers down here, we just keep the budget as it is. So this would actually. So this is the breakdown of what those various segments are, the amount of reduction, and then we come up with a new spend of 20, well, just under 26 grand. So be saving 14amonth. So there is an intelligence behind it.
Them: Yeah. Okay? Yeah.
Me: In that it is the ones that are produced. Some actions that we're interested in.
Them: Okay. And when you look in, are you looking to put these in? Do these today?
Me: I can do it. I could do as soon as you want, mate.
Them: Yeah. Can you go back to our current ad spend? I just want to look at a couple of things. The main thing being that NDA Mina has still got seven spaces left and we've only got 10 days to fill them. This is for the studio diploma. I just want to see what we're spending at the moment. Perhaps if you put it as budget and just, just. List it by budget. It should be near the top anyway. Can you just zoom in slightly as well? There you go. Nice. One.
Me: I'll take this. This is the last seven days. Your last 30 days.
Them: I'm more of looking at budget allocation. Perhaps it's better to do a smaller one because we should be starting to see a downturn now. So if we look at, say, the last seven days, We can see what? In fact, can we just look at yesterday? And see what. Budget was spent and what wasn't, it'd be interesting to see. And then if we just sort it by budget.
Me: Well, I was just doing that by spend there.
Them: I got it. Okay?
Me: I just roll that over to there?
Them: I can't see the budget, unfortunately.
Me: 's over there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So this is the actual spend.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's not far off, actually spending 100% on all of them.
Them: O. Kay. All right. 90, but it's baffling that £90 a day seems a lot for it to be spending all of it on a search campaign and. But then, you know, We've taken the CPAs off, haven't we?
Me: Yeah.
Them: So we are working.
Me: Last seven days. Yeah. It's not tracking any conversion in the last seven days.
Them: I wonder if a different way of playing it, rather than reducing the budget, is to start putting some look at what the CPRs currently are reduce. Put our CPAs in at say 20% less and see if it naturally reduces the budget.
Me: It throttled. It absolutely throttled. It's allowed me took the targets off to push it. It's still optimizing towards a conversion target. I mean, what I can do is we can increase the spend. If you look at that proposed.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Documents. Uae. I. Can't see on there. Your search brand UAE that's actually proposing to do a drop in it. So the UAE ones I can leave as they are for now and reduce the others. And then there is still to take us back to August level, there was still about 1,200quid in the budget. We were becoming below what the August targets were. So we've still got 1200 quid in the next seven days if we needed to increase these targets for a short space of time. And then put them back to where they were once that course finishes.
Them: Okay. We are also on the 5th, aren't we? Of November. So we've lost best part of the week. So we're going to have to have some buffer there anyway. But as long as. Look, I think, for want of a better. Can you just go back to the main ads account and see if the UK is spending all 300 of its pounds? If it did yesterday. It still is. I mean, that. That, for me, is. Weird because you'd think November by now it shouldn't be spending all its budget. And that just tells me potentially that we've started to increase by taking all our. CPAs off and put a lot more budget in there. We've potentially increased the market price of everything.
Me: If there's no demand, then people aren't clicking on. They're not using those search terms.
Them: I understand. But if it's gone from one pound a click, for example, to one pound fifty at click, you know, then we put that budget up to, say, 400, and it starts to fill it up. And then as time goes by, it says, well, actually, now it's £1 75 a click. And that and then it's, you know. And then, you know, you would. You would.
Me: The only thing that affects the average cpd, your CPC prices. Is obviously your target and it's targeting conversions. And it's also down to. Down to competition. If there's competition in there, then you're going to be paying more per click, but the overriding control is the fact that you're telling it to get conversions. You know, that's. That's your actual goal, is to achieve conversions. If someone comes on, they're not likely to convert, it's not going to bid on them.
Them: If you. If you own Google, let's say there was just one company in a particular sector.
Me: Conspiracy theory coming along.
Them: That was just a theory. I mean, it's, it, it's in theory based on, on good business practice. And if you owned Google and you had a, not just Google, I mean, any kind of marketplace, if there was just one person bidding on something, you know, you would eventually start to increase those bids. And if there was an algorithm. That's that. Noted. Well, actually. Because you want to maximize because you want to maximize revenue.
Me: No, I disagree with that. Now. I disagree with that completely. If that was the way Google was, then they'd be doing that for the last 25 years and no one would be making any money on it whatsoever. The whole purpose of Google and their mantra is relevance. If there's only it goes back to max CPCs. If you used to bid 10p, you would pay 10p. If someone else bidded 20p, then the most that they would pay is actually 11p. It was 1pmore. I disagree with that. I do not see that Google it's in their best interest in whatever way, shape or form for the long term survivability of the company to just go, let's just turn up those CPCs because we want to make some more money.
Them: I'm not saying that, but I mean, just to cover inflation, for example, they have to turn it up at certain amounts. So then the question is, how much?
Me: No, they don't turn it up. It's all driven by demand and it's all driven by competition. That's how it's done. And the relevance of that person coming along, the likelihood that they want to click.
Them: Okay, so. So let's say we're in a market with eight to eight different companies and we've turned up £300 a day, and we've, we've taken off our CPAs. Now, another company does the same, and another company does the same. Over time, it's going to go. Up and up and up. The question then is how much do we dominate the market? And I would say that we probably are the most dominant in the market for our keywords. Our ad budget, for example, is bigger than the whole revenue of, of the Interior Design Institute. I mean, we, if you go on Companies House, you look at their revenue. For a particular year, our ad budget is higher than their whole revenue. So I think that we are the dominant player in this market. And the more that we increase our ad budget and keep scaling up, the more effect it's going to have on the market. So I just wonder, perhaps.
Me: It can't be displaying things to people who are interested in, who are actually searching for it.
Them: No, I'm not saying. I'm not saying it's not. It is. What I'm saying is that by over competing in the market, we have the, the potential to start making the rates of the market go up. I mean, the same with anything with gold or Bitcoin or whatever. And the more people that buy, the more. The more expensive it gets. And so it, you know, potentially by us in October and September putting up our budgets, other people potentially either have had to compete and so on, but either way, even if we was just us in the space, we would have de facto increased the cost of the product. And I just wonder, potentially, rather than us reducing the budgets for October, we reduce our CPAs. And that would in theory have a knock on effect to say to Google, actually, this is the most we're going to pay. And I'm sure we will get throttled. I've got no doubt about it. But at some point it will say, okay, well, look, this is the. Because of course they're going to not want, you know, they want to encourage you to spend more and not encourage you to spend less. And so when you're spending less, they're going to throttle you. They're going to give you some sort of negative incentive. But at the same time, they want to make money as well. And there must be also, within the algorithm, the way to say, well, actually, look, this is the true market price. And then they go, ok, well, let's just reduce the market. This is the way that the market has responded. And we can't push too hard then, because then that links into your point about you can't do that forever. Because it'll hurt their brand. So, you know, I'm just. We in July and August had brilliant figures, you know, we were, I think.
Me: Because we remove the target.
Them: No understand.
Me: Prior to that, we had cpas. If you look at the cpos. I just put the cpas on now.
Them: I think that. I think. I think the main reason we had brilliant figures was because we'd started doing the offline conversions. I think that was the biggest catalyst.
Me: Ok? Now, I disagree with that. The offline conversions are still not performing the way they should do. We're still trying to get technical meetings with Google, trying to align people up to try and improve the quality of those offline conversions. We're not tracking anywhere near as many offline conversions as are actually appearing in the enrollments actually in the back end system. Now not everybody's using Google as not every one of them we can track. But the numbers are way off, absolutely way off.
Them: The point is. Google has now a much better understanding of who our actual customers are, though, because before it didn't have any understanding.
Me: They have a slightly increased level of understanding of who our customers are. We're on a CPA basis. If you look at the offline conversions and their overall contribution to the number of conversions that there are, it's small compared with the other conversions that we're tracking, which are the GA4 events.
Them: Yeah. Ok. I mean, look, we're probably going round in circles here. We were doing well in June, July, August. One of the big things that changed was that we had offline conversions then. One of the things that changed is that we took off the CPAs.
Me: I've. Been doing.
Them: Fine. Fine. Right. But ultimately, it doesn't stop the fact that June, July, August, we had great figures. And our cost, our marketing spend was way below 20%. September, we had great figures, but we did increase the budget massively. One of the things was that Pauline said we're way down on degrees. And I know. That we ramped up degrees quite a lot. We put a big amount of spend on degrees. I would say that the way we reduce spending the best is to reduce degrees again, because degrees tend to be cyclical. We'd get a big chunk of them in September. When people are looking to do higher education. Degrees are very much based on people expecting to study in September, stumbling across us and going, oh, that's good. The other most of our degrees come from diplomas where people have finished their diploma. It's like, ok, well, now I want to study the degree. So I think we can turn the degrees down substantially, and I think that will be. You know, if we turn the degrees down to where they were in August, that would, that would help us a lot. So that's why I want to go back to. Right. What were we. What were the exact budgets and everything that we were doing in August, because that'll be. If we can just go back to that and then. So. Yeah, I mean, as long. Look, if that is what we were doing in August, then we know that.
Me: And that's what this is? Yeah, that's what this is. Not exactly what we were doing on each one of those campaigns, but it is taking into consideration on the campaigns as to whether they were converting or not. So it would be pointless. For instance, on the. On the demeanor one there, we've had no conversions.
Them: Which mean.
Me: And this, this top one here, the interior design diploma. PMAX. So October, October spend was 750. Could be had. No conversions at all. So it's suggesting a new budget of 37 quid because there were no budgets in October. There were no conversions in October.
Them: Yeah. That's a P Max for interior design diplomas in Mena.
Me: Yeah.
Them: And spending approximately. What, £20 a day or something? £25 a day.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I mean, for me, that would be a top bracket. You know, I would say that's definitely something you'd want to keep because we do get a lot of diplomas in the region. Pmax is getting a big reach. We're also we've got.
Me: We've had no conversions. It had no conversions in October. None whatsoever. Whether they were GA4 ones or there were offline conversions.
Them: Yeah. And then it just comes down to, well, how much are we, you know, how much do we rely on the conversion data compared to the actual revenue data? I mean, this is. This is the problem is. I just. I don't know. I mean, is it real or is it fault?
Me: This is why I'm trying to do this correlation with the spreadsheets, to actually say what has actually happened in those in the countries where are we actually getting our conversions from, actual conversions, in a month. Then go and review these campaigns and say, ok, these are where the actual conversions have come from. Building the LAG because they're not going to buy in session, but building the lag and then say, this is the. This is the proposal for those campaigns based upon that. Because we've got instances where there've been lots of conversions in a particular area, actual conversions, and yet our budget is quite low on the campaigns. So there's an opportunity. This is. This is identifying an opportunity based upon actual fact where people put their hands in the pockets. You know, because of this, we will always have this discussion about, well, I don't believe that there's been no conversions because of that. Well, that is correct. There have been no conversions. Via the Google Ad system in that period of time.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And that's. That's an absolute. That's an absolute fact. You know, and when I say conversions once, it's optimizing towards.
Them: Is it? Is it? Is it, is it right to say that if there's no conversions on Google, that for sure means there's no conversions? Or is it, is it more right to say that if there are conversions on Google, it doesn't mean they're necessarily conversions?
Me: If there are, if the conversion's been shown on Google, then it means that one of these conversion actions has taken place and.
Them: No, no, I understand. My question is, let's forget the term let's. Let's have two different terms. Let's use sale and conversions.
Me: Enrollment is an enrollment conversion, isn't it?
Them: Okay. Enrollment. Enroll. So is it right to say that if there are zero conversions in a campaign, that must mean there were zero enrolments? Or is it?
Me: A non Google Ad. Google Ads.
Them: Okay. Got it. Right. So, so, so it, it could mean if there was zero conversions, it could mean there were enrollments. It's accurate to say that if there were conversions, it doesn't necessarily mean they're we're enrollments because we know that, for example, the India campaign looked like we had quite a lot of enrollments in October. We actually had zero. So.
Me: Because it could have been like that. An application completed. Which is that action.
Them: Yeah.
Me: There.
Them: Yeah. So. So I was just thinking, because if, if, if there were 0, 0 conversions. If that meant because there was zero conversions, it definitely must mean there are zero enrolments. Because even if there was an enrollment, because even if, you know, basically, is it going to ear high or is it going to low? And so if there was zero enrollments, that doesn't make the case then that, that we shouldn't be doing. We shouldn't be spending so much on that campaign. But just from a business, just from a business point of view, you would think, right? Well, where are your top hitters? What's your most likely. If you, if you were to have to make a bet, I would say Amina campaign on a PMAX with a relatively small 20 pound a day budget, I would say that's definitely a keeper. I mean, that's, you know, we're getting the whole Middle east relatively cheaply. And then the question comes, well, is why are people not converting? And is it, is it the case that because a lot of this after the initial spend of search and, you know, the obvious stuff goes from the PMAX campaign. It then ditches it onto YouTube and our YouTube videos aren't good enough. So then, you know,
Me: Correct. It's minimal what we do with show on YouTube.
Them: Well, for India it was quite high, wasn't it?
Me: Right? Yeah, but it's on that budget. It was from a percentage perspective.
Them: So. Yeah. So.
Me: And it doesn't jump, but it's doing all these things at the same time. It doesn't say, I'm going to start with Search and then I'm going to go onto YouTube. If someone fits in with an audience, they might show them the YouTube advert first. If they're showing intent towards enrolling, then it could use that as its starting point. Some people don't use Google search at all. They only go on YouTube.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But you're quite right. If it says no enrollments.
Them: Okay?
Me: Against them.
Them: No conversions.
Me: Sorry. No conversions. Then it's not contributed anything at all to whether there was an enrollment or not?
Them: Yeah. Okay, well, look, we're in November now anyway, so this is probably a good time to do experimenting. Let's. Let's.
Me: Because. Don't do that. It's a fuzzle faulty minute. Going. Sorry. Go on.
Them: So, yeah, the. The. I think now's a good time to do experimenting in November because it's usually a lowish month compared to the others. December will be an even lower month as well. So this seems like there is at least a strategy behind the theory. Let's, if you can just put it in. And then we'll give it a few days. What I would like to see, though, is that uae and because we've got these seven places that we need to sell, so I don't want to take too much out of the sales of the UAE budget quite yet.
Me: Okay? You'll leave those as they are at the moment. Then.
Them: Yeah. And then let's. So let's do the rest of it and then let's come back to UAE after 15 November.
Me: Yeah. I mean, the thing. The thing I'm working on at the moment is I'm building up this knowledge database. Of NDA and nma based on the stats that we're bringing in, the Google Ads, information that we've got to try and make more intelligent decisions upon what we do with budgets and push the money towards where things should be that is being developed at the moment. This is what's helped me do this stuff here, and it's only going to get better. The whole strategy side of things. I'm buzzing about it at the moment, absolutely buzzing.
Them: Okay?
Me: Because we can make intelligent decisions. The only thing that is against us is this whole idea of what is a conversion. I think they've got another meeting again on Friday just to check on NDA as to whether we're capturing things at the right time. Because the most important place to capture this is when someone first puts their details into Google. Not when they've submitted the form, but when they register with you. That's the point. To capture the information so that when they do convert further down the line, it becomes an enrollment. We're more likely to be able to fire that back into Google Ads as a proper conversion. And we're getting there. But if you looked on that conversion summary report before, the actual offline conversions contribute about 5% of the total conversion. So when I say it's not made a huge difference, it's because it's only 5% of the total.
Them: Okay? But it. But it. But they are actual legitimate like they are. They are legitimate.
Me: Google doesn't know that. It just sees it as a conversion.
Them: Okay. All right. Okay? So then the. So let's get that done. And then the other thing is that we've got these videos. And we should working on at the moment. So we should have some quality videos for the India campaign and then we would be able to tweak that as well for UAE mean all that sort of stuff for pmax. So we should have some decent videos which I hopefully will make a difference. Third thing is, could you Just give me a grand total of international spend versus UK spend on our Google Ads.
Me: Great. Enough. Yeah, brilliant. For which month?
Them: For. For last month. And get what? What this envisage is going forward. The new updated.
Me: Ok?
Them: Ideas. Yeah.
Me: Do you want that before I make the changes?
Them: No.
Me: Ok?
Them: But yeah, just, just, just around figure really, what's international spending versus you versus. Internet uk.
Me: No worries.
Them: And spent rather than budgets. First September, and then we'll just have budgets for October. Sorry. For October. And then budgets for. For the new thing.
Me: Ok? Oh. Fuck's sake. October 2025 uk vs. International.
Them: Because International has overtaken uk. Now it's partly International increasing revenue, but it's also UK losing revenue. So we. It, we might need to look at that.
Me: I think there's some real potential here, isn't there? To actually is just channeling that money towards the right countries now is actually identifying those places. It's great. With the international, obviously there's more data on the international, so we can do sort of like league tables where we want to actually target.
Them: Y. Eah. And my thing's always been with the UK as well is that we have spent a lot of time on the website and on backlinks, and it's got a lot of backlinks. It's a. It's an AC UK site, so it naturally ranks. And for most of the keywords, we are top three in any way. And it's always. I've always wanted to, but never had the balls to just say, actually, we're not spending uk, we're just cutting it off this month.
Me: Yeah, absolutely.
Them: Yeah. And.
Me: You know what? I might actually be able to get that kind of information. We've got GA4 LinkedIn, haven't we? We've got Google Analytics linked into the site. So I might be able to pull that information or just sort of do a. Do an initial kind of analysis on brands, on search and paid search and see what sort of percentage split we're getting and see whether we can actually. Again, it's going to be whether we can actually see whether it's a conversion or not, but we're using GA4 events here, so there's some sort of correlation between the two of them we could possibly look at. I'll do that.
Them: Okay? Good. All right. I mean, because that. That's one way to fix the budget, is just cut the UK out and then with half the budget, and it's like, okay.
Me: Somewhere else as well. Identify where to put it. That'd be awesome. That's steering towards at the moment. It's just, unfortunately, there's only 24 hours in the day.
Them: You've only got 24 hours over there, have you?
Me: The weird thing at the moment with the way I work now. I don't type a great deal. I actually just talk into my computer. And it's getting a little bit freaky now.
Them: Okay?
Me: But it's working. Well, I'd like to think you're already seeing an increase in the amount of information that you're getting. And this is only going to get more and more as time goes on.
Them: Good. All right, touchwood.
Me: Absolutely. All right, mate.
Them: Okay? Thanks, peter. See you later.
Me: No problem. Cheers. Bye bye now.
Them: Cheers. Bye bye.
