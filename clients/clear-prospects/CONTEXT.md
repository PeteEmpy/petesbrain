## Strategic Context

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Structure**: Performance Max for each brand (HSG, WBS, BMPM) with recent consolidation
- **Product Segmentation**: Custom label "ads off" used to intentionally exclude ~9,600 products from all campaigns (unprofitable or unwanted products maintained in feed for reference)
- **October 2025 Changes**: Consolidated products into individual PMax shopping campaigns (more conversion data for algorithm)
- **BMPM Restructuring**: Beginning of October - paused underperforming categories (branded mugs, coasters, napkins)
- **New BMPM Search Campaign**: Oct 21 - Started cushions ad group with broad match + AI Max, PMax budget dropped to £50/day
- **November 2025 Geographic Targeting Fix**: Changed 4 PMax campaigns (HSG/WBS Villains & Zombies) from PRESENCE_OR_INTEREST to PRESENCE targeting - eliminates 20-30% geographic waste (£142-213/month saved)
- **Reporting**: New AI-powered monthly reporting format implemented October 2025

### Why This Approach?
- **Custom label exclusions**: Prevents budget waste on products known to be unprofitable whilst maintaining complete product catalogue in Merchant Center
- **Product Hero segmentation**: Focus budget on Heroes & Sidekicks (top performers), allocate smaller budgets to Villains (optimization potential), and minimal/zero budget to Zombies (poor performers)
- **Result**: Google Ads Diagnostics shows ~17,782 "not eligible" products, but 76% (12,783) are intentionally not advertised - this is by design, not a problem

### Goals & KPIs
**Primary Goal**: Achieve profitability (ROAS >1.0) across all brands
**Target ROAS**:
- HSG: ~1.15x (achieved Oct 2025)
- WBS: ~1.30x (achieved Oct 2025)
- BMPM: Restructuring for profitability (was 0.10x in Sep, 0.00x in Oct)
**Target CPA**: <£10 (HSG achieving, WBS needs improvement)
**Performance Recovery**: October 1-19, 2025 showed strong improvements post-speed optimizations

## Historical Performance Patterns

### Seasonality
[TBD - analyze historical data]

### Year-Over-Year Trends
[TBD]

### Known Anomalies
[TBD]

---

## Client Preferences & Communication

### Communication Style
- **Proactive and detail-oriented**: Michael checks Google Ads Diagnostics page daily at 7 AM
- **On the ball**: Immediately notices and questions any changes or unusual metrics
- **Values transparency**: Expects clear explanations for account changes and performance shifts
- **Direct communication**: Asks concise questions, appreciates clear answers

### Decision-Making
- Makes urgent escalations when technical issues impact performance (e.g., Merchant Center disapprovals)
- Trusts account manager for strategic decisions but stays informed
- Monitors daily account health independently

### Red Flags / Sensitive Topics
- Desktop landing page issues (October 2025 recurring problem, now resolved)
- Product disapprovals affecting revenue
- Unexpected campaign status changes

### Reporting & Terminology Preferences
- **CRITICAL**: Michael provides "Margin" data (revenue minus product costs), NOT gross revenue
- **In all reporting**: Use "Margin" instead of "Revenue" when referring to Google Ads conversion value
- **Profit calculation**: Profit = Margin - Ad Spend (not Revenue - Ad Spend)
- **Why this matters**: Michael focuses on profit per sale and net profitability after both product costs AND ad costs
- **Example**: If Google Ads shows £5,989 conversion value, this is already margin (after product costs), so profit is £5,989 - £4,318 spend = £1,671
- **Michael's philosophy**: "Growth is not to grow generally but the sole growth is profit and nothing else matters... profit per sale"
- **CRITICAL - British English ONLY**: NEVER use American spellings in any correspondence with Michael
  - Use: optimise, analyse, realise, colour, behaviour, centre, customisation
  - NOT: optimize, analyze, realize, color, behavior, center, customization

**Shared Company Strengths Across All Brands**:
- **UK manufacturing heritage** - 25 years of manufacturing experience in Lancashire
- **Made-to-order flexibility** - Customisation and personalisation capabilities
- **Fast turnaround** - Next-day options available
- **Quality focus** - Emphasis on UK-made, quality materials, safety standards
- **Multi-channel approach** - Both B2C (HSG, WBS) and B2B (BMPM) markets

**Product Hero Label Segmentation** (Performance-Based Categories - Used in Google Ads campaigns):
- **Plan Level**: Pro Plan (€30/month per brand - WheatyBags, HappySnapGifts)
- **Heroes & Sidekicks (H&S)** - Top-performing products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains** - Underperforming products that drain budget but have optimization potential
- **Zombies** - Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance

**Note**: Campaign names referencing "H&S", "Villains", and "Zombies" refer to Product Hero performance labels, not actual product categories. Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs these labels to Google Merchant Center for campaign segmentation. This allows strategic budget allocation toward top performers while managing underperformers.

### Website & Technical
**Website Platform**: [TBD]

**Known Technical Issues**:
- **Desktop Caching Issues / Blocked Google Crawler IPs** (October 2025 - ✅ RESOLVED Nov 10, 2025)
  - **Problem**: Google Merchant Center crawler gets 404 errors on desktop
  - **Symptom**: Products intermittently disapproved with "Cannot access product landing page on desktop"
  - **Verification**: Pages load correctly when tested manually, but fail for Google crawler
  - **Root Cause Hypothesis** (October 30, 2025): Client has previously blocked IP addresses that may include Google's crawler IPs. Client checking blocked IPs to unblock Google's crawlers.
  - **Impact**: Products disapproved, stop serving in Shopping ads until re-indexed
  - **Solution**: Immediate re-index via Merchant Center when caught
  - **Monitoring**: Product Impact Analyzer Merchant Center tracking **DEPLOYED** (Nov 4, 2025) - Automated monitoring via Google Ads API runs every 6 hours (6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 12 AM). Detects products dropping to zero impressions (symptom of disapproval). LaunchAgent: `com.petesbrain.merchant-center`. Log: `~/.petesbrain-merchant-center.log`. See `/tools/product-impact-analyzer/MERCHANT-CENTER-SOLUTION.md` for technical details
  - **Brands Affected**: All three (HappySnapGifts, WheatyBags, BMPM)
  - **✅ RESOLUTION** (Nov 10, 2025): Issue resolved - product disapprovals no longer occurring
  - **Previous Workaround**: Manual re-index requests in Merchant Center until root cause confirmed and fixed
  - **Documentation**: See `/tools/product-impact-analyzer/QUICK-REINDEX-GUIDE.md`

**Conversion Tracking**:
- **Setup**: [TBD]
- **Known Issues**: BMPM "branded cushions" waste resolved Dec 2025 (see below)

## Key Learnings & Insights

### What Works Well

**HappySnapGifts "Personalised Face Masks" Campaign Recovery (Nov 2025 Analysis - CORRECTED)**
- **Campaign**: "CPL | HSG | Search | Photo Face Mask 130 20/6 AI 4/8 120 4/9 130 15/9"
- **Performance trend (verified from Google Ads API)**:
  - May 2025: 95% ROAS (losing money)
  - June 2025: 103% ROAS (marginally profitable)
  - July 2025: 124% ROAS (best summer month)
  - August 2025: 107% ROAS (profitable but inconsistent)
  - September 2025: 105% ROAS (restructure month, Sep 15)
  - October 2025: 105% ROAS (stabilising)
  - **November 2025: 129% ROAS (best performance in 6 months)**
- **What changed (Sep 15, 2025)**:
  - Campaign restructuring: Paused/consolidated Shopping campaigns competing for same queries
  - Shopping campaigns were fragmenting conversion data, preventing Smart Bidding optimisation
  - Consolidated budget into Search campaign with AI Max bidding
  - Target ROAS 130% set on Search campaign
- **Results**: +36% ROAS improvement from worst (May 95%) to best (Nov 129%) month
- **Key lesson**: Channel competition fragments conversion data and prevents Smart Bidding efficiency. Consolidating into best-performing channel stabilises and improves ROAS. Shopping isn't always best for product queries.
- **⚠️ Data Quality Note**: Previous analysis on Nov 4 stated "83% → 292%" but these figures could not be verified from Google Ads API. Corrected with verified data Nov 12, 2025.
- **📄 Documentation**: Full case study saved to `reports/monthly/november-2025-facemask-case-study.html` and key lessons extracted to `documents/facemask-case-study-key-lessons.md`

**Keyword Audit Resolution - BMPM "branded cushions" Crisis (December 2025)**
- **Audit Date**: 17th December 2025
- **Issue Identified**: BMPM keyword "branded cushions" (BROAD match) wasting £98.36 in 14 days (0 conversions) = £211/month projected waste
- **Paradox Discovered**:
  - Search term "branded cushions" = **871% ROAS** (12 clicks, £72 → £630 value) - highly profitable
  - Keyword "branded cushions" BROAD match = **0% ROAS** (36 clicks, £98 waste) - attracting wrong traffic
- **Action Taken**: Paused BROAD match keyword, kept EXACT match active (17th Dec 2025)
- **Expected Impact**: £211/month savings while preserving £630/month profitable traffic
- **Key Lesson**: Match type matters - broad match was triggering on non-converting variations, while exact match captured high-intent buyers searching specifically for "branded cushions"
- **Additional Findings**:
  - 78 converting search terms generating 184% blended ROAS (£3,514 spend → £6,461 value)
  - 2 Tier 1 negative keywords identified (£50/month additional savings when implemented)
  - Strong brand performance: WBS 265% ROAS, HSG 222% ROAS on brand terms
- **📄 Documentation**: Full audit at `audits/keyword-audit-2025-12-17.md` and implementation status at `audits/keyword-audit-2025-12-17-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`

### What Doesn't Work

**HappySnapGifts Shopping Campaigns for "Personalised Face Masks" (2025)**
- Multiple Shopping campaigns (Villains, Zombies, H&S) competed for "personalised face masks" query
- **Note**: "Villains", "Zombies", and "H&S" refer to Product Hero performance labels, not product categories
- May-Aug 2025: Generated thousands of impressions but minimal conversions
- Shopping wasn't the right channel for this specific search intent
- Solution: Paused competing Shopping campaigns, consolidated budget into Search

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Dec 17, 2025 | BMPM: Paused BROAD match "branded cushions" keyword, kept EXACT match active | Stopped £211/month waste while preserving 871% ROAS exact match traffic. Search term converts brilliantly (£72 → £630), but broad match was attracting wrong traffic. | Monitor performance - expect £211/month savings with no revenue loss |
| Sep 15, 2025 | HSG: Consolidated "personalised face masks" into Search campaign only, paused Shopping campaigns for this term | ROAS improved from 95% (May worst) to 129% (Nov best) = +36% improvement. Performance more stable post-consolidation. | Keep current structure, monitor if Nov performance sustains through full month |

### Recent Experiments (from log):
- 11/11/2025,Clear Prospects,"Campaign Audit Implementation: (1) Changed 4 PMax campaigns from PRESENCE_OR_INTEREST to PRESENCE targeting (HSG Villains, HSG Zombies, WBS Villains, WBS Zombies) - eliminates 20-30% geographic waste (£142-213/month saved). (2) Set BMPM PMax target ROAS to 70% (was no target) - gives algorithm profitability guidance. (3) Increased WBS PMax H&S budget from £120/day to £150/day - strong 129% ROAS performer. (4) Consolidated 3 low-volume HSG Search campaigns (Hot Water Bottle, Photo Bunting, Photo Face Cushion) into single campaign 'CPL | HSG | Search | Products 130 16/9' - improves Smart Bidding data volume (was 8, 3, 4 conv/month each). (5) NOTE: Cannot delete experiment campaigns (Google Ads restriction) - left enabled but not spending. (6) BMPM Nov 6 product feed change NOT visible in Merchant Centre - may be false positive from Product Impact Analyzer or sync issue."
- 04/11/2025 09:03,Clear Prospects,"HSG: Added exact match negative keyword [personalised face masks] to all Shopping and Performance Max campaigns. This term performs significantly better in Search (142% ROAS) vs Shopping (44% ROAS) based on 6-month data analysis (May-Nov 2025). Negative added to protect high-performing Search campaign and prevent budget waste. Monitor impact over next 30 days."
- 21/10/2025 17:14,Clear Prospects,BMPM search campaign started. This is a simple search campaign which initially just has cushions ad group with three broad match keywords using AI Max.
- 21/10/2025 17:15,Clear Prospects,"BMPM PMax campaign target removed, and budget dropped to £50 a day."

## Product Hero Settings

### Current Configuration (Last Updated: 2025-12-15)

**Product Hero Plan**: Pro Plan (€30/month per brand - WheatyBags and HappySnapGifts only)
**Note**: BMPM does not use Product Hero labels

**Campaign ROAS Targets by Brand**:

**WheatyBags (WBS):**
- H&S PMax: 130% (changed from 120% on 2025-12-15)
- Search (Wheat Bags): 100%
- Search (Brand): 140%
- Villains: 130% (changed from 120% on 2025-12-15)
- Zombies: 130% (changed from 120% on 2025-12-15)

**HappySnapGifts (HSG):**
- H&S PMax: 130% (changed from 120% on 2025-12-15)
- Search (Photo Face Mask): 130%
- Search (Brand): 140%
- Villains: 130%
- Zombies: 130%

**BMPM (No Product Hero):**
- PMax Shopping: 70%
- Search: Maximize Conversions (no ROAS target)

**Performance Notes**:
- WBS achieving 124-129% ROAS (meeting targets)
- HSG achieving 118-194% ROAS (exceeding targets, especially Villains/Zombies)
- BMPM struggling at 35-78% ROAS (crisis mode)

**Rationale**: Conservative ROAS targets (100-140%) reflect multi-brand portfolio approach with varying profit margins. Higher targets for brand campaigns (140%) vs generic search (100-130%). BMPM's low 70% target reflects crisis recovery mode.

| 2025-12-15 | WBS | Product Hero | ROAS Threshold | 90% | 103% | Tighter qualification for Heroes/Sidekicks classification | TBD - Review impact Dec 22 |
| 2025-12-15 | WBS | Product Hero | Min Clicks | 19 | 15 | Allow lower-traffic products to qualify as Heroes if ROAS high | TBD - Review impact Dec 22 |
| 2025-11-29 | WBS | Product Hero | ROAS Threshold | 80% | 90% | Improve product qualification standards | Correlated with +19pp overall ROAS improvement (121% → 139%) |
| 2025-11-29 | WBS | Product Hero | Min Clicks | 25 | 19 | Allow more products to qualify with lower traffic | Correlated with +19pp overall ROAS improvement |
| 2025-11-11 | BMPM | PMax Shopping | ROAS | None | 70% | Crisis management - set low target to build volume | Actual: 78% (+8pp) |
| 2025-11-04 | WBS | H&S PMax | Daily Budget | £120 | £150 | Increase capacity for top performers | Actual ROAS: 129% |
| 2025-09-04 | WBS | H&S PMax | ROAS | [TBD] | 120% | Initial campaign setup | Actual ROAS: 129% |

**Product Hero Threshold Impact Analysis (Nov 29, 2025):**

The November 29 Product Hero threshold changes (ROAS: 80% → 90%, Min Clicks: 25 → 19) showed clear correlation with improved campaign performance:

- **H&S Campaign**: 115% ROAS (Nov 15-28) → 137% ROAS (Nov 29-Dec 14) = **+22pp improvement**
- **Villains Campaign**: 168% ROAS (Nov 15-28) → 98% ROAS (Nov 29-Dec 14) = **-70pp decline** (product reclassification impact)
- **Zombies Campaign**: 169% ROAS (Nov 15-28) → 226% ROAS (Nov 29-Dec 14) = **+57pp improvement**
- **Overall WBS PMax**: 121% ROAS (Nov 15-28) → 139% ROAS (Nov 29-Dec 14) = **+19pp improvement**
- **30-Day Average**: 132% ROAS (Nov 15 - Dec 14)

The tighter Hero qualification standards appear to have improved budget allocation efficiency, with the main H&S campaign seeing significant improvement. The Villains decline likely reflects products being reclassified into different tiers, which is expected behaviour.

**Note**: Product Hero automatically classifies products daily as Heroes/Sidekicks/Villains/Zombies based on performance. These labels sync to Google Merchant Center and guide campaign structure. Target ROAS settings control the algorithm's bidding aggressiveness. Only WBS and HSG use Product Hero labels; BMPM does not.

**⚠️ CRITICAL - Product Hero Scope**: Product Hero labels ONLY apply to **Performance Max** and **Shopping** campaigns that pull from the Google Merchant Center feed. **Search campaigns are keyword-driven and DO NOT interact with Product Hero labels**. Never attempt to analyze Search campaign performance through a Product Hero lens (e.g., "which Search keywords drive Hero/Villain sales", "run product performance report for Search", etc.). Search campaign optimization is purely keyword/query-based.

## Action Items & Reminders

### Ongoing Tasks

- [ ] **Monitor Nov 11 Campaign Audit Implementation** (Review: Dec 9, 2025 - 4 weeks post-change)
  - **Geographic Targeting Fix (4 campaigns):** Verify 20-30% waste reduction (£142-213/month savings) on HSG/WBS Villains & Zombies campaigns
  - **BMPM PMax 70% Target ROAS:** Monitor if algorithm improves from 78% actual ROAS toward 70% target (may initially reduce spend as it avoids unprofitable auctions)
  - **WBS PMax H&S Budget Increase:** Track if £150/day budget utilizes better than previous £120/day (was 71% utilization), expect additional revenue at 129% ROAS
  - **HSG Consolidated Products Campaign:** Verify combined conversion volume enables better Smart Bidding (was 15 conv/month total from 3 campaigns)
  - **BMPM Nov 6 Feed Change Investigation:** Merchant Centre shows no change on Nov 6 - Product Impact Analyzer may have false positive, investigate data source

- [ ] **Monthly Report (Nov 2025)**: Include "personalised face masks" 6-month recovery story in HappySnapGifts analysis
  - Highlight ROAS improvement: 95% (May) → 129% (Nov) = +36%
  - Explain Sep 15 campaign restructure (Shopping → Search consolidation)
  - Show stabilisation and recent improvement trend
  - Key insight: Channel competition fragments conversion data, consolidation improves Smart Bidding
  - **⚠️ Caveat**: November data is partial month - need to verify performance sustains through full month

- [x] **COMPLETED: Nov 11 Campaign Audit Implementation**
  - ✅ Changed 4 PMax campaigns to PRESENCE targeting (eliminates geographic waste)
  - ✅ Set BMPM PMax target ROAS to 70%
  - ✅ Increased WBS PMax H&S budget from £120/day to £150/day
  - ✅ Consolidated 3 HSG Search campaigns into "CPL | HSG | Search | Products 130 16/9"
  - ⚠️ Cannot delete 6 experiment campaigns (Google Ads restriction) - left enabled
  - ⚠️ BMPM Nov 6 product feed change NOT visible in Merchant Centre (needs investigation)

- [x] **COMPLETED: Added Negative Keywords for "personalised face masks"** (Nov 4, 2025)
  - Added exact match `[personalised face masks]` to:
    * All Standard Shopping campaigns (if any active)
    * CPL | HSG | P Max Shopping | Villains 120 130 15/9
    * CPL | HSG | P Max Shopping | Zombies
    * CPL | HSG | P Max | All | H&S 120 130 8/9 120 9/9 130 15/9 120 4/10
  - Rationale: Search ROAS 142% vs Shopping ROAS 44% (6-month data May-Nov 2025)
  - Expected result: Protect high-performing Search campaign, stop budget waste in Shopping/PMax
  - Logged in experiments sheet: 04/11/2025 09:03
  - **Monitor impact over next 30 days** (review Dec 4, 2025)

### Future Plans
- [ ] **BMPM Strategy Decision (Mid-Dec 2025):** If BMPM PMax doesn't improve to 85%+ ROAS by mid-December, consider pausing PMax and focusing only on cushions Search campaign (started Oct 21)
- [ ] **WBS Main Search Budget Optimization:** Address 24% Budget Lost IS - either increase budget to £100/day OR improve Quality Score/Rank (currently also losing 67% Rank Lost IS)

## Document History

| Date | Change Made | Updated By |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-10-28 | Initial skeleton creation | Claude (automated) |
| 2025-10-30 | Added October 2025 context: Critical GMC disapproval issue (89 products), website speed problems, multi-brand structure (HSG/WBS/BMPM), October performance recovery, BMPM restructuring, client contact info | Claude Code |
| 2025-10-30 | Added Known Technical Issues section documenting desktop caching issue causing Merchant Center disapprovals. Documented plan for Product Impact Analyzer monitoring every 6 hours (6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 12 AM) for quick detection and re-indexing. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-04 | Updated Merchant Center monitoring status: Implementation ready for deployment, awaiting service account access grant. Created deployment docs at tools/product-impact-analyzer/MERCHANT-CENTER-QUICKSTART.md. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-04 | Added Key Learnings section documenting HSG "personalised face masks" 6-month turnaround (83% → 292% ROAS) following Sep 15 campaign restructure. Added action item reminder for Nov 2025 monthly report. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-04 | Completed negative keyword implementation: Added exact match [personalised face masks] to all HSG Shopping and PMax campaigns to protect high-performing Search campaign (142% ROAS vs 44% Shopping ROAS). Logged in experiments sheet with 30-day monitoring period. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-04 | October month-end response email sent to Michael. Addressed October performance (WBS 25% cost target achieved, HSG break-even at 21% costs, BMPM losses reduced 44%), face masks 6-month turnaround analysis, BMPM restructure impact, peak season positioning. Explained AI-assisted research system including Bagpuss product tracking and 24/7 Merchant Centre disapprovals monitoring across all three accounts. | Peter Empson |
| 2025-11-04 | Follow-up response to Michael's clarification request (Nov 4 email). Corrected face masks analysis - only ONE negative keyword added ([personalised face masks]), not six. Explained nuanced channel performance: most face mask terms don't follow simple "Search good, Shopping bad" pattern. Provided 5 theme-based SEO categories instead of specific term list. Committed to photo cushions analysis by end of week. Advised against Bagpuss ads (historic data unavailable, minimal recent search volume). Established email format preference: HTML format with British English spelling, tight spacing, suitable for Apple Mail copy/paste. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-10 | **RESOLVED**: Merchant Center Disapproval Recovery Strategy completed. Product disapproval issue (89 products affected Oct 20-28) now fully resolved. Updated Known Technical Issues and Current Issues sections to mark desktop caching/blocked Google crawler IP problem as resolved. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-12 | **DATA QUALITY CORRECTION**: Face masks performance figures corrected after verification with Google Ads API. Previous analysis stated "83% → 292%" but could not be verified. Corrected to verified figures: May-Nov trend shows 95% (worst) to 129% (best) = +36% improvement. Updated Key Learnings, Successful Tests table, and Action Items. Added data quality note to prevent future propagation of unverified figures. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-12 | **CASE STUDY DOCUMENTATION**: Saved face masks performance recovery case study to `reports/monthly/november-2025-facemask-case-study.html` for November monthly reporting. Extracted strategic lessons to `documents/facemask-case-study-key-lessons.md` covering: (1) Shopping isn't always best for e-commerce, (2) Channel competition fragments Smart Bidding data, (3) Volume reduction can improve efficiency, (4) Data verification is critical. Methodology template included for applying to other products (photo cushions next). | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-13 | **CLIENT PREFERENCES**: Added Michael's daily monitoring habits - checks Google Ads Diagnostics page daily at 7 AM, proactive and detail-oriented. Added custom label "ads off" strategy (~9,600 products intentionally excluded) to Strategic Context. Created proactive email explaining Diagnostics "not eligible" figure (17,782 total, only 41 actual issues). | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-13 | **DIAGNOSTICS MONITORING**: Set up automated daily monitoring of product diagnostics (runs 6:30 AM daily before Michael's 7 AM check). Tracks products with zero impressions as proxy for "not eligible" count. Alerts if unexpected spikes (10%+ increase or 100+ products). Baseline: 3,143 products actively serving (Nov 13). LaunchAgent: `com.petesbrain.diagnostics-monitor`. Log: `~/.petesbrain-diagnostics-monitor.log`. Script: `shared/scripts/diagnostics-monitor.py`. | Claude Code |
| 2025-11-13 | **PLANNED WORK CLEANUP**: Removed duplicate "Planned Work" section containing 20+ duplicate task entries referencing outdated "83% → 292%" figures. Replaced with "Completed Work" section documenting face masks analysis completion (Nov 4-12). This prevents task generator from creating redundant tasks based on already-completed work with incorrect data. | Claude Code |
| 2025-12-15 | **WBS ROAS TARGET INCREASES & PRODUCT HERO ANALYSIS**: Updated WBS PMax campaign ROAS targets from 120% to 130% (H&S, Villains, Zombies) based on strong 30-day performance (128%, 129%, 199% actual ROAS respectively). Documented Nov 29 Product Hero threshold changes (ROAS: 80%→90%, Clicks: 25→19) and confirmed clear correlation with +19pp overall ROAS improvement (121%→139%). Also documented Dec 15 Product Hero threshold changes (ROAS: 90%→103%, Clicks: 19→15) for tighter Hero qualification. Added Product Hero Threshold Impact Analysis section showing before/after performance by campaign. Michael's last trading day is Dec 19th (staff Dec 23rd before Christmas shutdown). | Claude Code |
| 2025-12-15 | **WBS H&S PMAX BUDGET INCREASE**: Increased WBS H&S PMax daily budget from £150 to £310 (+107% increase) for final trading week push before Christmas shutdown. Justified by strong 128% ROAS performance over last 30 days and new 130% ROAS target. Budget trajectory: £120 (Sep 4) → £150 (Nov 4) → £310 (Dec 15). | Claude Code |
| 2025-12-15 | **HSG H&S PMAX MASSIVE SCALE**: Increased HSG H&S PMax daily budget from £70 to £510 (+629% increase) and ROAS target from 120% to 130%. Aggressive final week push before Christmas shutdown. Budget trajectory: £70 (static since campaign launch) → £510 (Dec 15). Combined with WBS increase (£310), total H&S daily budget now £820/day across both brands. | Claude Code |
| 2025-12-15 | **REPORTING TERMINOLOGY PREFERENCE**: Added critical terminology standard to Client Preferences section. Michael provides "Margin" data (revenue minus product costs), NOT gross revenue. All future reporting must use "Margin" instead of "Revenue" when referring to Google Ads conversion value. Profit calculation = Margin - Ad Spend. Michael's philosophy: "Growth is not to grow generally but the sole growth is profit and nothing else matters... profit per sale." Also added CRITICAL requirement: NEVER use American spellings - British English only (optimise not optimize, analyse not analyze, etc.). This affects all performance reports and email communications. | Claude Code |
| 2025-12-16 | **PRODUCT HERO SCOPE CLARIFICATION**: Added critical clarification to Product Hero Settings section that Product Hero labels ONLY apply to Performance Max and Shopping campaigns (which pull from Merchant Center feed). Search campaigns are keyword-driven and DO NOT interact with Product Hero labels. This prevents incorrect analysis like "which Search keywords drive Hero/Villain sales" or "run product performance report for Search". Search optimization is purely keyword/query-based. Also updated WheatyBags keyword audit (2025-12-16) to remove incorrect Product Hero references for Search campaign analysis. Updated documentation: Clear Prospects CONTEXT.md, Product Hero Labelizer System methodology, google-ads-keyword-audit skill. | Claude Code |
