## Current Situation (November 2025)

**WBS:** Performing well (1,238% ROAS, £113 profit)
- Brand campaign spending what it can naturally (£10 for the month)
- Not budget limited - just limited branded search volume
- **New for 2026:** Implementing WBS search campaign from Google Ads, syncing over to Heroes & Sidekicks PMAX campaign now we're in chilly season (wheat bags peak demand period)

**HSG:** Losing money (46% ROAS, -£172 loss)
- Shopping campaign underperforming in peak season
- Same poor performance in Google Ads (46% ROAS) - suggests feed/stock/pricing issue rather than platform issue

**BMPM:** Not running on Microsoft Ads
- Google Ads showing 15% ROAS (catastrophic)
- Could test Microsoft Ads as alternative

## Microsoft Ads vs Google Ads Comparison

**Important Context:** Limited data makes direct comparison difficult, but here's what we can see from recent performance:

| Brand | Microsoft Ads ROAS (2025 YTD) | Google Ads ROAS (Nov 2025) | Comparison |
|-------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| WBS (WheatyBags) | 671% | 96% | Microsoft massively outperforms |
| HSG (HappySnapGifts) | 101% | 46% | Microsoft better (but both struggling) |
| BMPM | No presence | 15% | Google Ads catastrophic |

**Key Insight:** Microsoft Ads has been more profitable than Google Ads for WBS and HSG brands, but this is based on limited data (12 months, seasonal fluctuations, small sample size). The overall £4,690 profit is real, but difficult to predict if this pattern will continue.

## Trends & Patterns

**Quarterly Performance:**

| Quarter | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Profit |
|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | £459 | £636 | 139% | £177 |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | £1,235 | £1,791 | 145% | £556 |
| Q3 (Jul-Sep) | £1,095 | £4,176 | 381% | £3,081 |
| Q4 (Oct-Nov) | £1,427 | £2,303 | 161% | £876 |

**Key Observations:**
- Q3 exceptional due to WBS August bulk order
- Q4 underperforming vs Q3 (HSG struggling in peak season)
- Overall account profitable but trending down in Q4

---

## Issues to Address

**1. HSG November Collapse (Peak Season)**
- November ROAS: 46% (losing £172)
- Should be strongest month (Christmas gifts)
- Same issue in Google Ads → Check:
  - Merchant Centre feed (disapprovals?)
  - Stock availability for Christmas products
  - Pricing competitiveness

**2. BMPM Missing from Microsoft**
- Zero presence currently
- Google Ads failing (15% ROAS)
- Worth testing given limited downside

---

## 2026 Recommendation

**Keep Microsoft Ads? Yes - but with caveats**

**Reasoning:**
- Delivered £4,690 profit in 2025 (real money)
- WBS consistently profitable (671% ROAS vs Google's 96%)
- Low maintenance - minimal time investment required

**Caveats:**
- Limited data (12 months only, seasonal account)
- HSG barely breakeven - similar issues on both platforms

**Actions:**
1. **HSG:** Investigate November collapse (feed/stock/pricing check)
2. **BMPM:** Test Shopping campaign in December (£50/month trial)
3. **WBS:** Continue brand campaign + implement search campaign on Microsoft Ads mirroring Google Ads Heroes & Sidekicks PMAX (chilly season focus)

**Expected 2026:**
- WBS search campaign addition may increase spend but should maintain strong ROAS (currently outperforms Google 671% vs 96%)
- If HSG issue resolved: Similar to 2025 (£4,000-5,000 profit)
- If HSG not resolved: Pause HSG, keep WBS only (~£4,000-4,500 profit baseline, plus search campaign upside)

---

## Bottom Line

Microsoft Ads generated **£4,690 profit** in 2025 on £4,216 spend. That's a 211% return.

**Worth keeping?** Yes - it made money in 2025.

**The challenge:** Only 12 months of data on a seasonal account makes it hard to confidently predict 2026 performance.

**What it does for the money spent:** Delivers profitable branded traffic for WBS (massively outperforms Google Ads 671% vs 96%). HSG Shopping barely breakeven but same issues on Google Ads. Low maintenance supplementary channel.
