## Executive Summary: Is Microsoft Ads Worth Keeping?

### The Answer: **YES - But Only for 2 Brands**

**Overall 2025 Performance:**
- Total Spend: £4,216
- Total Revenue: £8,906
- **Profit: £4,690**
- Overall ROAS: 211%

**Per Brand Recommendation:**

| Brand | 2026 Decision | Reason |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **WBS (WheatyBags)** | ✅ **KEEP & SCALE** | 671% ROAS, £4,393 profit - your best channel, severely underutilized |
| **HSG (HappySnapGifts)** | ⚠️ **INVESTIGATE FIRST** | 101% ROAS overall, but 46% ROAS in November (peak season) - needs fixing |
| **BMPM (Trade)** | 🧪 **TEST IN 2026** | Zero presence currently, Google Ads failing at 15% ROAS |
| **TJR (JetRest)** | N/A | No longer part of strategy |

**Bottom Line:** Microsoft Ads delivered £4,690 profit in 2025, but **94% came from WBS alone**. The account is severely underutilized - WBS spending only £70/month despite 671% ROAS while HSG burns £318/month at 46% ROAS during peak season.

## Current Performance (November 2025) vs Full Year

### What's Happening RIGHT NOW (November 2025)

| Brand | Nov Spend | Nov Revenue | Nov ROAS | Nov Profit/Loss | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **WBS** | £10 | £123 | **1,241%** | **+£113 profit** | ✅ Peak season, performing ABOVE annual average |
| **HSG** | £318 | £146 | **46%** | **-£172 loss** | 🔴 Peak season, performing BELOW annual average |

### Full Year Context (Jan-Nov 2025)

| Brand | Total Spend | Total Revenue | Avg ROAS | Total Profit | Months Active |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **WBS** | £769 | £5,162 | **671%** | **+£4,393** | 11 |
| **HSG** | £3,426 | £3,463 | **101%** | **+£37** | 11 |
| **TJR** | £21 | £281 | **1,330%** | **+£260** | 7 (paused July) |

**Key Insight:** November shows the problem clearly:
- **WBS in peak season (cold weather):** Performing BETTER than annual average (1,241% vs 671%)
- **HSG in peak season (Christmas gifts):** Performing WORSE than annual average (46% vs 101%) - **COLLAPSE**

---

## The WBS Opportunity: Severely Underutilized

### Current State
- Spending: £10-40/month (average £70/month)
- ROAS: 671% annual average, **1,241% in November**
- Profit: £4,393 (2025 total)
- Season: Q4 is **PEAK** for cold weather products

### The Problem
**WBS is your most profitable channel** but receives only 18% of Microsoft Ads budget while delivering 94% of profit.

### November 2025 (Current)
- Spend: £10
- Revenue: £123
- ROAS: **1,241%**
- Profit: **£113**

**This is your PEAK SEASON and you're only spending £10 for the entire month.**

### What If You Scaled WBS?

| Scenario | Monthly Spend | Expected Revenue (at 900% ROAS) | Expected Profit |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Current** | £70 | £630 | £560 |
| **Conservative Scale** | £150 | £1,350 | £1,200 |
| **Aggressive Scale** | £300 | £2,700 | £2,400 |

**Opportunity Cost:** At £150/month with conservative 900% ROAS (below current 1,241%), you'd generate **+£640/month additional profit** vs current £70/month spend.

**Annual Impact (2026):** £150/month = **+£7,680/year additional profit** if ROAS maintains above 600%.

---

## The HSG Problem: Peak Season Collapse

### Current State (November 2025)
- Spending: £318/month
- ROAS: **46%** (losing money)
- Loss: **-£172/month**
- Season: Q4 is **PEAK** for Christmas gift products

### This is CRITICAL
**HSG sells personalised photo gifts** (cushions, face masks, frames, bunting). November-December should be the strongest months of the year. Instead, it's losing £172/month.

### Full Year Performance

| Month | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| Jan 2025 | £94 | £14 | 15% 🔴 | Poor |
| Feb 2025 | £12 | £0 | 0% 🔴 | No conversions |
| Mar 2025 | £56 | £122 | 217% ✅ | Good |
| Apr 2025 | £467 | £319 | 68% 🔴 | Scaled too fast |
| May 2025 | £259 | £206 | 79% 🔴 | Below breakeven |
| Jun 2025 | £458 | £728 | 159% ✅ | Good |
| Jul 2025 | £410 | £888 | 217% ✅ | Good |
| Aug 2025 | £593 | £397 | 67% 🔴 | Poor |
| Sep 2025 | £360 | £177 | 49% 🔴 | Poor |
| Oct 2025 | £398 | £466 | 117% ✅ | Peak season starts well |
| **Nov 2025** | **£318** | **£146** | **46%** 🔴 | **PEAK SEASON COLLAPSE** |

**The Pattern:**
- **Jun-Jul 2025:** Strong performance (159-217% ROAS) ✅
- **Aug-Sep 2025:** Collapse (67-49% ROAS) 🔴
- **Oct 2025:** Recovery to 117% ROAS ✅
- **Nov 2025:** Worse collapse (46% ROAS) 🔴

### Lost Opportunity in November

**What November SHOULD be generating:**
- Current: £318 spend at 46% ROAS = £146 revenue = **-£172 loss**
- Expected (peak season): £318 spend at 150% ROAS = £477 revenue = **+£159 profit**
- **Lost in November alone: £331**

**If December follows same pattern:** Another £350-400 lost in peak season.

### What Changed?

**Same campaign running** (Shopping Heroes) in Oct vs Nov, so the campaign structure didn't change. Likely causes:

1. **Product feed issues** - Check Merchant Centre for disapprovals
2. **Stock issues** - Key Christmas products out of stock?
3. **Site issues** - Checkout problems during peak season?
4. **Competitive auction** - CPCs spiked in November?
5. **Bid strategy change** - Was target ROAS increased?

**NOTE:** This November collapse is happening in **BOTH Microsoft Ads (46% ROAS) AND Google Ads (46% ROAS in weekly report)** - suggests this is a **feed/site issue, not platform-specific**.

## The BMPM Gap: Missing Opportunity

### Current Microsoft Ads Status
**BMPM has ZERO Microsoft Ads presence.**

### Why This Matters Now

**From Google Ads (Nov 2025 week):**
- BMPM Google Ads: **15% ROAS** (catastrophic)
- Spend: £458/week
- Revenue: £70/week
- **Loss: -£388/week**

**Microsoft Ads Opportunity:**
If Microsoft Ads delivers even 100% ROAS for BMPM (vs Google's 15%), that's:
- Breakeven vs £388/week loss in Google
- Potential savings: **£388/week = £1,552/month**

**Test Recommendation:**
- Launch BMPM Shopping campaign on Microsoft Ads
- Start with £50/month budget (£1.65/day)
- Run for 4 weeks in December
- If ROAS >80%, it's better than Google Ads
- If successful, shift budget from failing Google campaigns

## Channel Comparison: Microsoft vs Google Ads

### WBS: Microsoft MASSIVELY Outperforms

| Platform | ROAS | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Microsoft Ads** | **671%** | Extremely profitable ✅ |
| **Google Ads** (Nov week) | **96%** | Unprofitable ⚠️ |

**Strategic Implication:** WBS should prioritize Microsoft Ads budget over Google Ads.

### HSG: Both Platforms Struggling (November)

| Platform | ROAS | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Microsoft Ads** | **46%** | Losing money 🔴 |
| **Google Ads** (Nov week) | **46%** | Losing money 🔴 |

**Strategic Implication:** This is NOT a Microsoft Ads problem - it's an HSG problem (feed, site, or product availability).

### BMPM: Microsoft Untested

| Platform | ROAS | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Microsoft Ads** | **-** | Not running |
| **Google Ads** (Nov week) | **15%** | Catastrophic 🔴 |

**Strategic Implication:** Microsoft Ads can't be worse than 15% ROAS. Worth testing.

## Profit Analysis: Where Did the £4,690 Come From?

### 2025 Profit Breakdown

| Brand | Spend | Revenue | Profit | % of Total Profit |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **WBS** | £769 | £5,162 | **£4,393** | **94%** |
| **HSG** | £3,426 | £3,463 | **£37** | **1%** |
| **TJR** | £21 | £281 | **£260** | **6%** |
| **TOTAL** | £4,216 | £8,906 | **£4,690** | **100%** |

### The Problem With Current Budget Allocation

**Current allocation:**
- **81% of budget** to HSG (delivers 1% of profit)
- **18% of budget** to WBS (delivers 94% of profit)
- **Budget is allocated BACKWARDS**

**What budget allocation SHOULD be (based on profitability):**
- **WBS:** 70-80% of budget (current top performer)
- **HSG:** 20-30% of budget (until performance improves)
- **BMPM:** Test with 5-10% of budget

## Seasonal Patterns: Full Year Context

### Quarterly Performance

| Quarter | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Profit | Key Events |
|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|------------|
| **Q1 (Jan-Mar)** | £459 | £636 | 139% | £177 | Building phase |
| **Q2 (Apr-Jun)** | £1,235 | £1,791 | 145% | £556 | Growth phase |
| **Q3 (Jul-Sep)** | £1,095 | £4,176 | 381% | £3,081 | WBS peak (Aug bulk order: £2,959) |
| **Q4 (Oct-Nov 18)** | £1,427 | £2,303 | 161% | £876 | Peak season, but HSG collapsing |

**Key Observations:**
- **Q3 exceptional** due to WBS August bulk order (£2,959 revenue on £13 spend)
- **Q4 should be strongest** for both WBS (cold weather) and HSG (Christmas) but HSG is failing
- **If Q4 maintained Q3 efficiency:** Would generate £5,440+ revenue (currently tracking £2,303)

### Monthly Trends: WBS vs HSG

**WBS Seasonality (Strong All Year):**
- Q1: 168-324% ROAS
- Q2: 162-463% ROAS
- Q3: 438-23,294% ROAS (Aug outlier)
- Q4: **859-1,241% ROAS** ← Currently in peak season

**HSG Seasonality (Volatile):**
- Q1: 0-217% ROAS (very inconsistent)
- Q2: 68-217% ROAS (improved in June-July)
- Q3: 49-217% ROAS (collapsed Aug-Sep)
- Q4: **46-117% ROAS** ← Should be peak season, but collapsing

## 2026 Recommendations

### 1. WBS: SCALE IMMEDIATELY (P0 Priority)

**Current Situation:**
- Spending £10-70/month during peak season
- Delivering 671-1,241% ROAS
- Generating 94% of Microsoft Ads profit

**2026 Action:**
- ✅ **Increase budget to £150-200/month** (from current £70/month)
- ✅ **Monitor daily for first 2 weeks** - watch for ROAS drop
- ✅ **Target: Maintain 500%+ ROAS** at higher spend
- ✅ **If successful, scale to £300/month** in Q1 2026

**Expected 2026 Impact:**
- £200/month at 600% ROAS = £1,200/month revenue = **£1,000/month profit**
- **Annual 2026 profit from WBS: £12,000+** (vs £4,393 in 2025)

**Risk:** Low - WBS has been consistently profitable all year across all spend levels.

---

### 2. HSG: INVESTIGATE & DECIDE (P0 Priority)

**Current Situation:**
- Spending £318/month during peak season
- Delivering 46% ROAS (should be 150%+ in Christmas season)
- **Losing £172/month** in November

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. ✅ **Check Merchant Centre** (MC ID: 7481296) for product disapprovals
2. ✅ **Review stock availability** for top Christmas products
3. ✅ **Check Google Ads Change History** (Nov 1-10) for bid changes
4. ✅ **Analyse Microsoft Ads Change History** for campaign modifications
5. ✅ **Compare to Google Ads performance** (both showing 46% ROAS - suggests site/feed issue)

**December Decision (Based on Investigation):**

**IF issue identified and fixable:**
- Continue at reduced budget (£100-150/month)
- Monitor daily through Christmas season
- Expect recovery to 120-150% ROAS

**IF issue NOT fixable:**
- **Pause HSG Microsoft Ads entirely**
- Reallocate £318/month budget to WBS
- Re-evaluate in January after Christmas season

**2026 Decision:**
- **Keep ONLY if Dec 2025 shows recovery** to 100%+ ROAS
- **Pause if Dec 2025 remains below 80%** ROAS
- **Current trajectory: losing money, not worth keeping**

---

### 3. BMPM: TEST IN DECEMBER 2025 (P1 Priority)

**Current Situation:**
- Zero Microsoft Ads presence
- Google Ads catastrophically failing (15% ROAS, -£388/week loss)

**Test Plan:**
- ✅ **Launch "BMPM Shopping Heroes" campaign**
- ✅ **Budget: £50/month (£1.65/day)** for December test
- ✅ **Use existing Google Shopping feed** (MC ID: 7522326)
- ✅ **Run for 4 weeks minimum** (full December)
- ✅ **Compare to Google Ads performance**

**Success Criteria:**
- **If ROAS >80%:** Better than Google (15%), shift budget
- **If ROAS >100%:** Profitable, scale to £100-150/month in 2026
- **If ROAS <50%:** Pause, channel not viable for BMPM

**2026 Decision:**
- **If December test successful (>80% ROAS):** Allocate £100-200/month, reduce Google Ads
- **If December test fails (<50% ROAS):** No Microsoft Ads for BMPM in 2026

**Compare to 2025:**
- 2025 profit: £4,690
- 2026 projected profit: £15,240
- **Increase: +£10,550 (+225%)**

**Key Assumption:** WBS maintains 600%+ ROAS at higher spend (conservative vs current 1,241%).

## Key Takeaways for Michael

1. **Microsoft Ads is worth keeping** - delivered £4,690 profit in 2025

2. **The problem: you're backing the wrong horse**
   - 81% of budget to HSG (1% of profit)
   - 18% of budget to WBS (94% of profit)

3. **WBS is severely underutilized**
   - Only £10 spent in November during peak season
   - Delivering 1,241% ROAS
   - Should be £200-300/month

4. **HSG is collapsing during peak season**
   - November: 46% ROAS (should be 150%+)
   - Losing £172/month during Christmas
   - Same issue in Google Ads (46% ROAS) - not platform-specific

5. **BMPM is missing from Microsoft Ads**
   - Google Ads failing (15% ROAS)
   - Microsoft Ads untested
   - Worth testing given Google's failure

6. **2026 Potential:**
   - Current path: £4,690 profit/year
   - Optimized path: £15,000-20,000 profit/year
   - **Requires: Shift budget from HSG to WBS**

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate HSG November collapse (this week)
2. Scale WBS budget to £200/month (immediate)
3. Launch BMPM test campaign (December)
4. Review results in January for 2026 budget allocation

**Bottom Line:** Microsoft Ads is worth it, but only if you fix the budget allocation problem and investigate the HSG collapse.
