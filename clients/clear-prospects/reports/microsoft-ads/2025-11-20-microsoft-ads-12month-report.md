**Recommendations:**

   - Product feed issues in Merchant Centre
   - Bid strategy changes
   - Seasonal demand shifts
   - Competitive landscape changes
3. Review April/August scaling attempts - identify why performance degraded
4. Consider campaign diversification beyond Shopping Heroes
5. Compare Microsoft Ads vs Google Ads performance for HSG - if Google significantly outperforms, consider reallocating budget

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ **Reactivate campaign** - Historically profitable with 1,330% ROAS

## Channel Comparison: Microsoft Ads vs Google Ads

### Performance Contrast (Where Data Available)

| Brand | Platform | ROAS | Observation |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| **WBS** | Microsoft | **671%** | Exceptional performance |
| **WBS** | Google | 96% (Nov week) | Unprofitable in Google |
| **HSG** | Microsoft | **101%** | Marginal |
| **HSG** | Google | 114% (Nov week) | Slightly better |
| **TJR** | Microsoft | **1,330%** | Exceptional (but paused) |
| **BMPM** | Microsoft | - | No campaigns active |
| **BMPM** | Google | 15% (Nov week) | Critical collapse |

**Strategic Insights:**
1. **WBS performs far better in Microsoft Ads** (671% vs 96%) - priority channel for WheatyBags
2. **HSG similar performance** across both platforms (101% vs 114%) - neither optimized
3. **BMPM has zero Microsoft Ads presence** - opportunity to test if Google performance remains poor
4. **Microsoft Ads is lower volume but higher efficiency** for this account

**Budget Allocation Recommendation:**
- **WBS:** Increase Microsoft Ads budget, maintain or reduce Google Ads
- **HSG:** Optimize both platforms, neither performing well
- **TJR:** Reactivate Microsoft Ads, test Google Ads if not already active
- **BMPM:** Test Microsoft Ads as alternative to failing Google campaigns

## Campaign Strategy Analysis

### Campaign Types Active

| Campaign Type | Brands | Performance | Recommendation |
|--------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Shopping Heroes** | HSG, WBS | Mixed (HSG: 104%, WBS: 197%) | Optimize HSG, scale WBS |
| **Company Name** | WBS, TJR | Excellent (WBS: 1,227%, TJR: 738%) | Scale both |
| **Consolidated** | WBS | Poor (83%) | Already paused (Jan only) |

**Strategic Gaps:**
1. **No BMPM campaigns** - Opportunity to test if Google Ads remains poor
2. **HSG over-reliant on Shopping Heroes** - No brand campaign for HSG
3. **TJR paused since July** - Opportunity loss (1,330% historical ROAS)

---

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. URGENT: Investigate HSG November Performance Collapse
**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Timeline:** This week
**Effort:** 60 minutes

**Issue:** HSG November ROAS collapsed to 46% (losing £172 on £318 spend). This is 55% below breakeven.

**Impact:** Currently losing £12/day in November. If December follows same pattern, will lose £360+ in Q4.

**Action:**
1. Check Microsoft Ads Change History for November (any bid changes, targeting changes)
2. Review Merchant Centre feed status for HSG products
3. Analyse search terms - are irrelevant queries increasing?
4. Compare November product mix to June/July (when ROAS was 159-217%)
5. Check if competitor activity increased (auction insights)
6. Consider pausing HSG Microsoft Ads entirely if Google Ads performs better

**Success Criteria:** Restore HSG ROAS to 100%+ or pause campaign to stop losses.

---

### 2. Scale WheatyBags Microsoft Ads Budget
**Priority:** P0 - High Opportunity
**Timeline:** This week
**Effort:** 15 minutes

**Issue:** WBS delivering 671% ROAS but only spending £70/month. This is extreme underutilization of a high-performing channel.

**Impact:** If scaled from £70/month to £150/month while maintaining 500% ROAS:
- Revenue increase: £400/month (£4,800/year)
- Profit increase: £320/month (£3,840/year)

**Action:**
1. Increase WheatyBags - Company campaign budget from current to £5/day (£150/month)
2. Monitor daily for first week - watch for ROAS drop
3. If ROAS maintains above 400%, continue scaling
4. If ROAS drops below 300%, reduce back to current levels
5. Scale gradually - don't jump more than 100% budget increase at once

**Success Criteria:** Maintain ROAS above 400% while spending £150/month.

---

### 3. Reactivate The JetRest Campaign
**Priority:** P1 - Medium Opportunity
**Timeline:** This week
**Effort:** 10 minutes

**Issue:** TJR campaign paused since July 2025 despite 1,330% historical ROAS. Opportunity loss of £40-60/month potential revenue.

**Impact:** If reactivated at £10/month with 700% ROAS (conservative):
- Monthly revenue: £70
- Monthly profit: £60

**Action:**
1. Reactivate "The JetRest - Company" campaign
2. Set daily budget to £0.35/day (£10/month)
3. Monitor for 2 weeks
4. If ROAS remains above 400%, scale to £1/day (£30/month)
5. Check for seasonal patterns - may perform better in travel seasons

**Success Criteria:** Achieve 400%+ ROAS on reactivation.

---

### 4. Test BMPM on Microsoft Ads
**Priority:** P2 - Test Opportunity
**Timeline:** Next week
**Effort:** 45 minutes

**Issue:** BMPM Google Ads collapsed to 15% ROAS this week. Zero Microsoft Ads presence. Microsoft could be viable alternative channel.

**Impact:** If Microsoft Ads delivers 100% ROAS on £100/month (vs Google's 15%):
- Breakeven vs £85/month loss in Google
- Potential savings: £85/month (£1,020/year)

**Action:**
1. Create "BMPM - Company" Shopping campaign in Microsoft Ads
2. Start with £1/day (£30/month) budget
3. Use same product feed as Google Shopping
4. Run for 4 weeks minimum to gather data
5. Compare to Google Ads performance
6. If Microsoft outperforms, shift budget allocation

**Success Criteria:** Achieve 80%+ ROAS (better than Google's 15%).

---

### 5. Optimize HSG or Reallocate Budget to WBS
**Priority:** P2 - Strategic Decision
**Timeline:** End of month
**Effort:** 90 minutes

**Issue:** HSG spending 81% of Microsoft Ads budget (£3,426 of £4,216) but delivering only 101% ROAS. WBS spending 18% but delivering 671% ROAS.

**Impact:** If £100/month shifted from HSG to WBS:
- HSG loss reduction: £1/month (marginal)
- WBS gain: £570/month at 671% ROAS
- **Net benefit: £569/month (£6,828/year)**

**Action:**
1. Reduce HSG Shopping Heroes budget by £100/month
2. Increase WBS budget by £100/month
3. Monitor HSG revenue impact (should be minimal at 101% ROAS)
4. Monitor WBS scaling efficiency
5. If WBS maintains 500%+ ROAS, continue reallocation
6. Alternatively: Pause HSG entirely if Google Ads outperforms significantly

**Success Criteria:** Overall account ROAS increases from 211% to 280%+.

---

### 6. Quarterly Performance Review Cadence
**Priority:** P3 - Process Improvement
**Timeline:** Ongoing
**Effort:** 30 minutes/quarter

**Issue:** No regular Microsoft Ads reporting cadence. Google Ads gets weekly reports, Microsoft Ads gets none.

**Impact:** Earlier detection of issues like HSG November collapse. Better strategic decisions.

**Action:**
1. Implement monthly Microsoft Ads performance review
2. Compare to Google Ads performance monthly
3. Identify budget reallocation opportunities quarterly
4. Track year-over-year trends (when 2026 data available)
5. Use standardized report template (this format)

**Success Criteria:** Monthly report generated by 5th of each month.
