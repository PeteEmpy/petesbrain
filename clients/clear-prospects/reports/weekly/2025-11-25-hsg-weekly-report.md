## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. Investigate ROAS Deterioration [P0]

**Issue:** ROAS dropped from 166% to 124% (-42pp) despite 42% increase in spend and 26% increase in conversions.

**Analysis:**
- Main P Max campaign (£868.45 spend) saw ROAS drop from 135% to 116%
- P Max Shopping Zombies campaign ROAS crashed from 872% to 25% (-847pp)
- Search Products campaign ROAS dropped from 100% to 64%

**Action Required:**
1. Review conversion tracking - ensure all conversions are being captured correctly
2. Check if product margins changed this week (affecting conversion values)
3. Analyse Search Terms report for wasted spend on irrelevant queries
4. Review P Max Shopping Zombies campaign - consider pausing if low-quality products

**Impact:** Recovering to last week's 166% ROAS would increase revenue by £582/week (£30,264/year)

### 2. Scale High-ROAS Opportunities [P1]

**Opportunity:** Several products/campaigns showing exceptional performance:
- Birthday Photo Face Masks: 1005% ROAS on £5.52 spend
- P Max Shopping Villains: 270% ROAS on £51.67 spend
- Premium Water Bottles: 388% ROAS on £12.36 spend

**Action Required:**
1. Increase budget allocation to Villains segment (currently £50/week)
2. Create dedicated campaign for Birthday Photo Face Masks
3. Test increasing bids for Water Bottles in P Max

**Impact:** Scaling these winners could add £200-300/week in profitable revenue

### 3. Review Search Products Campaign Efficiency [P1]

**Issue:** "Search | Products120 16/9" delivering 64% ROAS with £16.94 CPA - well below target.

**Analysis:**
- Spend nearly doubled WoW (+91%) but conversions only grew 17%
- CPA increased significantly
- Campaign likely picking up low-intent searches

**Action Required:**
1. Review Search Terms report and add negative keywords
2. Tighten match types from Broad to Phrase where appropriate
3. Consider lowering ROAS target from 120% to 100% or pausing if no improvement

**Impact:** Improving to 115% ROAS or pausing would save £60/week in wasted spend

### 4. Pause or Restructure Zombies Campaign [P0]

**Issue:** P Max Shopping Zombies delivered only 25% ROAS (£15.52 revenue on £61.37 spend) - losing £45.85 this week.

**Action Required:**
1. Review which products are in the Zombies segment
2. Either pause the campaign entirely OR
3. Reduce budget to £10/week maximum to maintain presence
4. Add products with repeated zero conversions to "ads off" custom label

**Impact:** Pausing would save £51/week = £2,652/year
