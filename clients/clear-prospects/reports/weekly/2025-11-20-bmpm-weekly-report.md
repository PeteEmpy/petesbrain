## Campaign Breakdown

### Campaign Performance Summary

| Campaign | Spend | Conv | Conv Value | ROAS | WoW ROAS Change |
|----------|-------|------|------------|------|-----------------|
| **CPL \| BMPM \| P Max Shopping** | £352 | 1.6 | £70 | **20%** 🔴 | -102pp ↓ |
| **CPL \| BMPM \| Search \| Promotional Merchandise** | £106 | 0.0 | £0 | **0%** 🔴 | 0pp → |

### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE: Entire Brand Performance Collapse

#### Campaign 1: PMax Shopping Campaign Revenue Crash
**Campaign:** CPL | BMPM | P Max Shopping
**Spend:** £352/week (77% of budget)
**ROAS:** 20% (was 122% last week, target 70%)
**Change:** -102pp ROAS collapse, -84% revenue drop

**Issue:** Revenue crashed from £444 to £70 (-84%) while spend remained stable (£365 → £352). This is abnormal and suggests one of:
1. **Conversion tracking broken** - Most likely cause (84% drop is too severe for normal variance)
2. **Merchant Centre feed issues** - Products disappeared or got disapproved
3. **Nov 11 ROAS target change** - Setting 70% target may have confused algorithm
4. **Major product disapprovals** - Top-selling products removed from feed
5. **Attribution window change** - Conversions no longer being attributed

**Previous Performance:**
- Last week: £365 spend, £444 conv value, 122% ROAS, 5.4 conversions
- This week: £352 spend, £70 conv value, 20% ROAS, 1.6 conversions
- **Conversion drop: -70% (5.4 → 1.6)**
- **Revenue drop: -84% (£444 → £70)**

**Impact:** £352/week at 20% ROAS = £282/week loss. If restored to even 70% target (conservative) = £246 revenue vs current £70 = +£176/week gain. **This is unsustainable at current levels.**

---

#### Campaign 2: Search Campaign - Zero Conversions (2 Weeks Running)
**Campaign:** CPL | BMPM | Search | Promotional Merchandise
**Spend:** £106/week (23% of budget)
**ROAS:** 0% (was 0% last week)
**Change:** No change - still zero conversions

**Issue:** Search campaign spending £106/week for 2+ consecutive weeks with absolutely zero conversions. This campaign started Oct 21 with simple broad match keywords for cushions. It has never generated a single conversion.

**Performance Data:**
- Spend: £106 this week, £91 last week
- Conversions: 0 both weeks
- Revenue: £0 both weeks
- Clicks: 34 this week (CPC £3.12)
- Impressions: 638
- CTR: 5.3% (decent engagement)

**Why Zero Conversions?**
- Keywords too broad for B2B intent?
- Landing page not optimized for B2B buyers?
- Products in campaign don't match search intent?
- B2B buyers don't convert online (prefer quote/contact forms)?

**Impact:** £106/week × 4 weeks = £424/month in pure waste with zero return.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Pause this campaign today.

---

### Campaign Insights

**Critical Observation:** Both campaigns are catastrophically underperforming:
- PMax: 20% ROAS (target 70%)
- Search: 0% ROAS (target: any positive ROAS)

**No bright spots** - Entire brand needs emergency intervention.

**Context from CONTEXT.md:**
- BMPM underwent restructuring in Oct 2025 for profitability
- Was 0.00% ROAS in Oct, 0.10% in Sep
- Oct 21: New Search campaign started (cushions, broad match)
- Nov 11: PMax target ROAS set to 70% (was no target)
- Nov 11: PMax budget dropped to £50/day (from higher level)

**Hypothesis:** Setting 70% ROAS target on Nov 11 may have caused algorithm to restrict serving, but revenue collapse is too severe for that alone. More likely conversion tracking or feed issue.

## Product Performance

### Top Products by Revenue (MC ID: 7522326)

| Product | Conv Value | Conv | ROAS | Spend | Clicks |
|---------|------------|------|------|-------|--------|
| **Branded Tablecloth (Rectangle Mini Sample Navy)** | £63.97 | 1.0 | 300% ✅ | £21 | 8 |
| **Custom Hot Water Bottle Cover** | £5.70 | 0.4 | 131% | £4 | 5 |
| **Custom Sash** | £0.20 | 0.2 | 3% | £6 | 9 |

**Total Revenue This Week:** £70 across all products
**Total Revenue Last Week:** £444 across all products
**Drop:** -84%

**Critical Insight:** Only 3 products generated any revenue this week. This is extremely limited compared to typical B2B promotional merchandise accounts.

**Questions:**
1. Where are the top-selling products from last week?
2. Did bulk order products get disapproved?
3. Are products out of stock in Merchant Centre?

---

### Products with Spend but No Conversions (Wasted Budget)

| Product | Spend | Clicks | Impressions | Issue |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Branded Armband** | £2 | 1 | 158 | Low relevance |
| **Custom Headrest Covers** | £0.26 | 1 | 53 | Low volume |
| **Wholesale Cushion Inners** | £0.22 | 1 | 23 | Possibly B2C searchers |
| **Bulk Branded Santa Hats** | £0.32 | 1 | 533 | Seasonal, wrong timing |

**Observation:** Most products getting minimal clicks/impressions. Feed may be poorly optimized or products aren't competitive.

## Week-over-Week Trends

### Daily Performance Pattern

| Metric | Pattern | Observation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Spend** | Stable | +0% WoW (£456 → £458) |
| **Conversions** | Collapsed | -70% WoW (5.4 → 1.6) |
| **Revenue** | Collapsed | -84% WoW (£444 → £70) |
| **Efficiency** | Catastrophic | ROAS dropped from 97% to 15% |

**Trend Analysis:**
- Spend remained stable but conversions/revenue collapsed
- Suggests tracking issue or feed disapprovals (not scaling issue)
- If this was normal performance variance, spend would also fluctuate
- Pattern matches conversion tracking failure

**Correlation with Known Events:**
- Nov 11: PMax ROAS target set to 70% (was no target)
- Nov 11: Could this have affected attribution or tracking?
- Need to check Change History for any conversion action changes

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. URGENT: Investigate Conversion Tracking Immediately
**Priority:** P0 - Critical/URGENT
**Timeline:** TODAY - Start immediately
**Effort:** 60-90 minutes

**Issue:** 84% revenue drop (£444 → £70) in one week strongly suggests conversion tracking failure rather than normal performance variance.

**Impact:** If tracking is broken, all optimization is blind. If restored = +£374/week revenue recovery. **This is the highest priority across all 3 brands.**

**Action (Step-by-Step):**
1. **Verify Google Ads conversion tag is firing:**
   - Check last 7 days of conversion actions in Google Ads
   - Compare conversion volume to previous week
   - Check if "Purchase" conversion action shows data

2. **Check Google Tag Manager (if used):**
   - Verify GTM container hasn't been accidentally modified
   - Check if tag firing rules changed
   - Review GTM preview mode on bmpm.trade checkout

3. **Test checkout process manually:**
   - Complete a test purchase on bmpm.trade
   - Verify conversion fires in Google Ads (may take 24 hours)
   - Check Google Analytics 4 for matching transaction

4. **Review Google Ads Change History (Nov 6-20):**
   - Filter for "Conversion tracking" changes
   - Check if conversion actions were modified/paused
   - Look for attribution window changes

5. **Check Merchant Centre (MC ID: 7522326):**
   - Review product disapprovals
   - Check if bulk order products got removed
   - Verify feed is uploading correctly

**Success Criteria:** Identify root cause of 84% revenue drop within 24 hours.

---

### 2. URGENT: Pause Search Campaign Immediately
**Priority:** P0 - Critical/URGENT
**Timeline:** TODAY - Pause immediately
**Effort:** 5 minutes

**Issue:** Search campaign spending £106/week with zero conversions for 2+ consecutive weeks. Started Oct 21, has never converted.

**Impact:** Immediate savings of £106/week (£460/month) with zero revenue loss.

**Action:**
1. **Pause campaign immediately in Google Ads**
2. Review Search Terms report to understand what queries triggered ads
3. Review landing pages - are they optimized for B2B buyers?
4. Check if B2B buyers prefer quote/contact forms over direct purchase
5. Decision point: Delete campaign entirely OR restructure with different approach

**Success Criteria:** Stop £106/week waste immediately. Decide within 7 days if Search is viable for BMPM.

---

### 3. Review Merchant Centre Feed Status
**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Timeline:** TODAY
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Issue:** Only 3 products generated revenue this week vs many more last week. Suggests product disapprovals or feed issues.

**Impact:** If products reinstated = potential +£200/week revenue recovery.

**Action:**
1. Log into Merchant Centre (MC ID: 7522326)
2. Check Diagnostics page for disapprovals
3. Review "Products" tab - filter by "Disapproved" or "Limited serving"
4. Check feed upload status - when did it last successfully upload?
5. Compare active products this week vs last week
6. Request re-index if products incorrectly disapproved (similar to Clear Prospects desktop issue)

**Success Criteria:** All eligible products back in "Approved" status within 48 hours.

---

### 4. Review Nov 11 ROAS Target Change Impact
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Timeline:** This week
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Issue:** Nov 11 PMax ROAS target set to 70% (was no target). Check if this change affected algorithm serving.

**Impact:** If target too restrictive, relaxing it could recover revenue.

**Action:**
1. Review Google Ads "Insights" page for PMax campaign
2. Check if algorithm shows "Limited by ROAS target" messaging
3. Compare serving before/after Nov 11 target implementation
4. Consider temporarily removing ROAS target to test if serving improves
5. Alternative: Increase target to 100% (less restrictive) for 7 days

**Success Criteria:** Determine if 70% target is restricting serving, adjust if needed.

---

### 5. Analyse Top Products from Last Week
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Timeline:** This week (after #1 completed)
**Effort:** 45 minutes

**Issue:** Need to identify which products drove £444 revenue last week but only £70 this week.

**Impact:** If specific products identified, can investigate why they stopped converting.

**Action:**
1. Pull Shopping Performance View data for Nov 6-12 (last week)
2. Identify top 10 revenue-generating products
3. Check current status of each:
   - Still in Merchant Centre feed?
   - Approved or disapproved?
   - Stock availability?
   - Price changes?
4. Compare to this week's top 3 products
5. Identify which products "disappeared" from revenue generation

**Success Criteria:** Identify root cause of product performance collapse.

---

### 6. Consider Emergency Budget Reduction
**Priority:** P2 - Medium
**Timeline:** After #1 and #2 completed
**Effort:** 5 minutes

**Issue:** Running £458/week at 15% ROAS is unsustainable. Losing £389/week.

**Impact:** Reducing budget to £100/week until issues resolved saves £288/week in losses.

**Action:**
1. IF tracking/feed issues not resolved within 48 hours:
   - Reduce PMax daily budget from £50 to £20
   - Pause Search campaign (already recommended in #2)
   - Total budget: £140/week (down from £458)
2. Monitor for 7 days
3. Once issues resolved, scale back up gradually

**Success Criteria:** Limit losses while root cause investigation continues.

## Root Cause Analysis Summary

**Most Likely Causes (in order):**

1. **Conversion tracking failure (70% probability):**
   - 84% revenue drop too severe for normal variance
   - Spend stable while revenue collapsed (tracking pattern)
   - Conversion count dropped 70% (5.4 → 1.6)

2. **Merchant Centre product disapprovals (20% probability):**
   - Only 3 products generated revenue (vs many more normally)
   - Similar to HSG/WBS desktop caching issues (now resolved)
   - Product Hero segmentation may have excluded products

3. **Nov 11 ROAS target too restrictive (10% probability):**
   - 70% target may limit algorithm serving
   - But drop too severe for this alone

**Recommended Investigation Order:**
1. Verify conversion tracking (highest probability, highest impact)
2. Check Merchant Centre feed status
3. Review Nov 11 changes impact
4. Pause Search campaign (independent issue)

---

## Strategic Questions for Client

1. **Has website been updated recently?** Any changes to checkout process, GTM container, or conversion tracking?
2. **Are you seeing orders in your system?** If yes but not in Google Ads = tracking issue. If no orders at all = larger business problem.
3. **B2B buyer behavior:** Do most BMPM customers request quotes first rather than purchasing online?
4. **Product availability:** Are promotional merchandise products in stock and available for purchase?
