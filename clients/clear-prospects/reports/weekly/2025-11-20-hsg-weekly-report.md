### Campaigns Requiring Attention

#### 🔴 Critical Issue: Main PMax Campaign ROAS Collapse
**Campaign:** CPL | HSG | P Max | All | H&S
**Spend:** £621/week (55% of budget)
**ROAS:** 104% (was 145% last week, target 115%)
**Change:** -41pp ROAS drop, -13% revenue despite +21% spend

**Issue:** Largest campaign by spend dropped below profitability despite budget increase. Revenue fell from £742 to £646 (-13%) while spend rose from £512 to £621 (+21%). This accounts for the majority of HSG's overall decline.

**Impact:** £621/week at 104% ROAS = £25/week profit vs £231/week profit if at target 115% ROAS. **Opportunity cost: £206/week (£892/month).**

---

#### 🔴 Critical Issue: Zombies Campaign Revenue Crash
**Campaign:** CPL | HSG | P Max Shopping | Zombies
**Spend:** £56/week
**ROAS:** 84% (was 945% last week)
**Change:** -861pp ROAS drop, -91% revenue drop (£511 → £47)

**Issue:** Previously star-performing campaign (945% ROAS) suffered catastrophic collapse. Revenue dropped 91% on stable spend. This suggests:
- Product disapprovals in Merchant Centre
- Feed issues preventing products from serving
- Nov 11 PRESENCE targeting change negatively affected this campaign
- Conversion tracking issue specific to this campaign

**Impact:** Lost £464/week in revenue. If restored to even 400% ROAS (conservative), would generate +£177/week revenue.

---

#### 🔴 Issue: Products Campaign Bleeding Money
**Campaign:** CPL | HSG | Search | Products
**Spend:** £81/week
**ROAS:** 26% (was 136% last week)
**Change:** -110pp ROAS drop

**Issue:** Consolidated campaign (created Nov 11 from 3 low-volume campaigns) generating massive losses. Only 2.8 conversions on £81 spend = £29 CPA when average is £8.37.

**Impact:** £81/week at 26% ROAS = £60/week loss.

**Recommendation:** Pause this campaign immediately. It was consolidated to improve Smart Bidding data volume, but the opposite occurred. Consider splitting back out or pausing entirely.

---

### Campaign Insights

**Bright Spot:** Villains campaign improved dramatically from 188% to 449% ROAS (+261pp). This small-budget campaign (£44/week) is now the star performer. Consider increasing budget here.

**Concern:** 4 of 6 campaigns are now unprofitable (below 115% target). Only Villains (449%) and Brand (124%) are hitting targets.

### Bottom 10 Products (High Spend, Low ROAS)

| Product | Spend | ROAS | Conv Value | Issue |
|---------|-------|------|------------|-------|
| **Personalised Dog Photo Cushion** | £24 | 63% | £15 | Losing £9 per product |
| **Bike Seat Cover** | £20 | 55% | £11 | Low conversion rate (1.5 conv on 71 clicks) |
| **XL Photo Mug (Blue)** | £11 | 36% | £4 | Poor relevance (0.67 conv) |
| **Double-Sided Collage Cushion** | £9 | 116% | £11 | Marginal profitability |
| **Lifesize Birthday Poster** | £9 | 184% | £17 | Actually profitable - remove from this list |

**Key Issues:**
- Bike seat covers generating waste (71 clicks, only 1.5 conversions)
- Dog photo cushions not converting well despite decent traffic
- Photo mugs underperforming significantly

**Recommendations:**
1. Add negative keywords for bike-related searches (low intent)
2. Review dog cushion product page and images (high bounce rate suspected)
3. Consider pausing XL mugs entirely

---

### Notable Product Changes Week-over-Week

**Winners (Significant Improvement):**
- Cat Face Cushion: Strong performance maintained

## Week-over-Week Trends

### Daily Performance Pattern

| Metric | Pattern | Observation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Spend** | Steady increase | +25% WoW indicates budget expansion |
| **Conversions** | Slight increase | +6% but not keeping pace with spend |
| **Revenue** | Declining | -24% despite higher traffic |
| **Efficiency** | Worsening | ROAS dropped from 189% to 114% |

**Trend Analysis:**
- Spending more but earning less - classic efficiency breakdown
- Conversion rate likely declined (more clicks, only slightly more conversions)
- Suggests either:
  - Feed quality issues
  - Poor-quality traffic increase
  - Seasonal demand shift
  - Nov 11 campaign changes negatively affected performance

**Correlation with Known Events:**
- Nov 11: Campaign consolidation (3 Search campaigns → 1)
- Nov 11: PRESENCE targeting change on 4 campaigns
- Both changes appear to have negatively affected performance

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. URGENT: Investigate Main PMax Campaign Decline
**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Timeline:** Start today, complete within 48 hours
**Effort:** 90 minutes

**Issue:** Main H&S PMax campaign ROAS collapsed from 145% to 104% (-41pp) while spend increased 21%. This is the primary driver of HSG's overall decline.

**Impact:** £621/week at 104% ROAS vs target 115% ROAS = £68/week opportunity loss. **Potential monthly gain: £295.**

**Action:**
1. Review Google Ads Change History (Nov 6-20) for any campaign setting changes
2. Check Merchant Centre for product disapprovals (MC ID: 7481296)
3. Analyse placement performance - is Shopping/Display/Discover mix different?
4. Review asset group strength ratings - has asset quality declined?
5. Check conversion tracking - verify purchase events are firing correctly
6. Compare top-performing products this week vs last week

**Success Criteria:** Identify root cause and restore ROAS to 115%+ within 7 days.

---

### 2. URGENT: Investigate Zombies Campaign Revenue Crash
**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Timeline:** Start today, complete within 24 hours
**Effort:** 60 minutes

**Issue:** Zombies campaign ROAS collapsed from 945% to 84% (-861pp). Revenue dropped 91% (£511 → £47). This is abnormal and suggests something broke.

**Impact:** Lost £464/week in revenue. If restored to 400% ROAS = +£177/week revenue gain. **Potential monthly gain: £768.**

**Action:**
1. Check if Nov 11 PRESENCE targeting change affected this campaign negatively
2. Review Merchant Centre product status - check for disapprovals
3. Analyse which specific products drove revenue last week - are they still active?
4. Verify conversion tracking for this campaign specifically
5. Check if geographic exclusions removed key markets
6. Review search impression share - did visibility collapse?

**Success Criteria:** Restore revenue to at least £200/week (400% ROAS) within 7 days.

---

### 3. Pause Products Consolidated Campaign
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Timeline:** This week
**Effort:** 15 minutes

**Issue:** Nov 11 campaign consolidation (3 campaigns → 1) resulted in 26% ROAS performance, losing £60/week.

**Impact:** Immediate savings of £60/week loss. **Monthly savings: £260.**

**Action:**
1. Pause "CPL | HSG | Search | Products" campaign immediately
2. Review performance of original 3 campaigns (Hot Water Bottle, Photo Bunting, Photo Face Cushion)
3. If original campaigns had better performance, consider un-consolidating
4. Alternative: Keep paused and reallocate budget to Villains campaign (449% ROAS)

**Success Criteria:** Stop the £60/week bleed immediately.

---

### 4. Scale Villains Campaign (Winner)
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Timeline:** This week
**Effort:** 10 minutes

**Issue:** Villains campaign improved from 188% to 449% ROAS (+261pp) but only spending £44/week. This is underutilised.

**Impact:** If budget increased to £100/week at 400% ROAS = +£224/week revenue. **Potential monthly gain: £970.**

**Action:**
1. Increase daily budget from £6.30 to £15/day (£105/week)
2. Monitor performance daily for first 3 days
3. If ROAS maintains above 300%, continue scaling
4. If ROAS drops below 200%, reduce back to £6.30/day

**Success Criteria:** Maintain ROAS above 300% while scaling spend.

---

### 5. Audit Face Masks Campaign for Cannibalisation
**Priority:** P2 - Medium
**Timeline:** Next week
**Effort:** 45 minutes

**Issue:** Face Masks Search campaign performance stable (115% ROAS) but check if PMax campaigns are competing for same queries.

**Impact:** Potential +£50/week if search terms better allocated to Search vs Shopping.

**Action:**
1. Run Search Terms report for all PMax campaigns
2. Identify face mask queries triggering in PMax
3. Add face mask negative keywords to PMax campaigns (Shopping, Villains, Zombies)
4. Monitor Face Masks Search campaign performance improvement
5. Reference: Nov 4 negative keyword implementation ([personalised face masks])

**Success Criteria:** Face Masks Search ROAS improves to 130%+.

---

### 6. Review Hot Water Bottle Product Pages
**Priority:** P3 - Low
**Timeline:** This month
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Issue:** Hot water bottle covers are top revenue generators but ROI could be improved (139-141% ROAS).

**Impact:** Potential +£20/week revenue if conversion rate improves 10%.

**Action:**
1. Review product pages for hot water bottle covers
2. Check mobile usability (most traffic is mobile)
3. Ensure images show product quality clearly
4. Verify pricing is competitive
5. Check stock levels aren't limiting sales

**Success Criteria:** Hot water bottle ROAS improves to 180%+.
