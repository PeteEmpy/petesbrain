## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. Bridge 9pp Gap to Target ROAS [P0]

**Objective:** Improve from 121% to 130% ROAS (+9pp)

**Strategy:**
1. **Budget Reallocation** - Shift spend from Search (96% ROAS) to Brand (193% ROAS)
   - Reduce Search daily budget from current level by 10-15%
   - Increase Brand campaign budget by £20-30/day to capitalise on high-ROAS demand

2. **Main P Max Optimisation**
   - Review Asset Group performance in P Max H&S campaign
   - Check if recent product feed changes affected quality scores
   - Analyse Search Categories report for wasted spend

3. **Bidding Adjustment**
   - Consider testing tROAS bid strategy on Search campaign (currently 96% ROAS)
   - Set target at 130% to align with account goals

**Impact:** Achieving 130% ROAS would increase weekly revenue by £170 (£8,840/year)

### 2. Scale Brand Campaign Success [P1]

**Opportunity:** Brand Inclusion campaign delivering 193% ROAS on £197 spend - significantly outperforming

**Action Required:**
1. Increase daily budget by 50% (from ~£28/day to ~£42/day)
2. Monitor impression share - currently at 99.1%, so limited growth potential
3. Consider adding brand-adjacent terms (e.g., "heat packs", "microwave wheat bags")

**Impact:** Could add £50-70/week in profitable revenue without compromising efficiency

### 3. Investigate P Max H&S ROAS Drop [P0]

**Issue:** Main P Max Shopping H&S campaign ROAS fell from 140% to 120% (-20pp) despite 67% conversion increase.

**Diagnosis Needed:**
1. Check if Average Order Value decreased (conversions up but value growth slower)
2. Review Shopping feed for product disapprovals or price changes
3. Analyse placement performance (Search vs Shopping vs Display vs YouTube)
4. Check competitor activity - may indicate increased competition driving up CPCs

**Action Required:**
1. Run Placement report for last 2 weeks
2. Verify Merchant Centre feed has no errors
3. Compare AOV this week vs last week
4. If AOV dropped, review which products are converting (may need feed segmentation)

**Impact:** Recovering to 140% ROAS would add £197/week revenue

### 4. Maintain Zombies Momentum [P2]

**Observation:** Zombies segment jumped from 34% to 174% ROAS - excellent recovery

**Action Required:**
1. Identify which products drove the improvement
2. Consider moving top performers from Zombies to Villains or H&S segment
3. Monitor for 2 more weeks to confirm this isn't an anomaly
4. If sustained, slightly increase budget allocation

**Impact:** Maintaining strong Zombies performance adds diversification and stability

## Search Term Analysis Required

### Priority Actions

1. **Search Campaign Negative Keywords**
   - Review Search Terms report for "Wheat Bags" campaign (96% ROAS)
   - Look for broad match waste (generic terms like "heat pack", "pain relief")
   - Add irrelevant terms as negatives

2. **Brand Protection**
   - Ensure Brand campaign isn't picking up generic terms
   - Verify exact/phrase match keywords are triggering (not broad)

3. **Competitor Keywords**
   - Check if competitors are bidding on "WheatyBags" brand term
   - Adjust bids accordingly to maintain top position

---

## Budget & Impression Share

**Current State:**
- P Max H&S: 57.9% Search Impression Share (room to grow)
- Search Wheat Bags: 10.0% impression share (budget-limited)
- Brand: 99.1% impression share (maximised)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Increase Budget on Search Wheat Bags** if efficiency improves to 115%+ ROAS
2. **Maintain P Max budget** - 58% impression share suggests budget not limiting
3. **Brand is maxed** - shift focus to protecting position rather than growth
