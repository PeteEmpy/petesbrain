## Placement Analysis

| Placement | Spend | Conv Value | ROAS | Conversions | Share of Spend |
|-----------|-------|------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Search Network** | £1,149 | £1,244 | 108% | 99.1 | 35% |
| **Shopping/Display/YouTube (Mixed)** | £2,165 | £2,276 | 105% | 208.8 | 65% |

## Week-over-Week Trends

### Daily Performance Pattern

**Spend Trend:** Flat to slightly increased (+6.3% WoW)
**Conversion Trend:** Essentially flat (+0.3% WoW)
**Revenue Trend:** Declining (-5.5% WoW)

**Analysis:**
- **Efficiency degradation:** Spending more (+6%) to generate same conversions (+0.3%), but those conversions worth less (-5.5% value)
- **ROAS compression:** Declined from 119% to 106% (-13pp) - moving away from profitability
- **Traffic quality:** Clicks up 13% and impressions up 13.5%, but conversion volume flat - suggests lower-quality traffic or audience fatigue

**Possible Causes:**
1. **BMPM drag:** BMPM campaigns (£413 combined spend) delivering terrible ROAS (11% combined) pulling account average down
2. **WBS PMax budget increase effect:** Budget jumped from £120 to £150/day on 11 Nov - algorithm may still be learning with new budget level
3. **Seasonal competition:** Week before Black Friday - increased competition may be driving up CPCs

## Brand Breakdown

### HappySnapGifts (HSG)

**This Week:** £1,074 spend | £1,447 value | 135% ROAS ✅
**Last Week:** £1,029 spend | £1,056 value | 103% ROAS
**Change:** +37% revenue | +32pp ROAS

**Performance:** STRONG RECOVERY - HSG rebounded sharply this week after last week's dip. PMax H&S campaign drove the improvement (+36pp ROAS). Budget increased from £110 to £160/day this week - ROAS improved whilst scaling significantly. All Search campaigns profitable (Brand 108%, Face Masks 133%, Products 91%).

**Key Campaigns:**
- PMax All H&S: 122% ROAS (vs 86% last week) ✅ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT - Budget increased £110→£160/day, spend increased 5% (£757→£794), revenue increased 49% (£652→£970)
- Search Face Masks: 133% ROAS ✅
- Search Brand: 108% ROAS ✅
- ⚠️ **Zombies PMax collapsed:** 31% ROAS (was 106%) - needs investigation

**Note:** HSG budget increase executed exceptionally well - unlike WBS which saw ROAS decline after budget increase, HSG improved both volume AND efficiency simultaneously. This is rare and indicates strong campaign health.

### WheatyBags (WBS)

**This Week:** £1,658 spend | £2,009 value | 121% ROAS ✅
**Last Week:** £858 spend | £1,068 value | 124% ROAS
**Change:** +93% spend | +88% revenue | -3pp ROAS

**Performance:** STRONG VOLUME - Budget increased to £160/day on PMax H&S (was £120/day) drove massive spend increase (+93%). Revenue scaled proportionally (+88%) with minor ROAS decline (-3pp). Brand campaign exceptional (193% ROAS).

**Key Campaigns:**
- Search Brand: 193% ROAS ✅ EXCELLENT
- PMax Villains: 237% ROAS ✅ (low volume)
- PMax Zombies: 182% ROAS ✅ (low volume)
- PMax H&S: 106% ROAS (vs 125% last week) - efficiency dip after budget increase
- Search Wheat Bags: 101% ROAS ✅

**Note:** Budget increase impact - PMax H&S budget now £160/day (was £120/day), ROAS dropped 19pp (125% → 106%) but generated £528 additional revenue. Weekly spend £864 = avg £123/day, indicating campaign not yet utilizing full £160 budget. Algorithm likely still optimising with new budget level.

### BMPM (British Made Promotional Merchandise)

**This Week:** £413 spend | £64 value | 15% ROAS ❌ CRISIS
**Last Week:** £142 spend | £35 value | 25% ROAS
**Change:** +192% spend | +81% revenue | -10pp ROAS

**Performance:** CRITICAL STATE - BMPM performance remains terrible. Despite spending £413 this week, only generated £64 revenue (15% ROAS). Search campaign delivered ZERO conversions (£123 wasted). PMax marginally better but still catastrophic (22% ROAS).

**Key Issues:**
- Search campaign: 0 conversions despite £123 spend → PAUSE IMMEDIATELY
- PMax: Only 1 conversion all week, 22% ROAS (target 70%, gap -48pp)
- Combined: Losing 85p of every £1 spent

**Recommendation:** Serious consideration needed for pausing BMPM entirely and reallocating budget to profitable HSG/WBS campaigns. B2B promotional products may not suit Google Ads auction dynamics.

---

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. PAUSE BMPM Search Campaign - Zero Conversions (P0 - TODAY)

**Issue:** BMPM Search campaign spent £123.24 this week with ZERO conversions. Complete failure.

**Impact:** £500+/month wasted spend with zero return. Immediate pause would improve account ROAS by ~1.5pp.

**Action:**
1. Pause "CPL | BMPM | Search | Promotional Merchandise" campaign IMMEDIATELY
2. Investigate conversion tracking - verify tag is firing for BMPM products
3. Review search queries - check if traffic is relevant B2B intent
4. If conversion tracking verified as working, consider BMPM Search unsuitable for this business model

**Timeline:** TODAY
**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes (pause + investigation)

---

### 2. Investigate HSG Zombies PMax Collapse (P0 - TODAY)

**Issue:** HSG Zombies PMax campaign collapsed from 106% ROAS (£628 spend) last week to 31% ROAS (£54 spend) this week. Conversion value dropped 97%.

**Impact:** This was a £600+/week campaign that suddenly stopped performing. Potential £2,500/month revenue loss if not resolved.

**Action:**
1. Check Merchant Centre for product disapprovals affecting "Zombies" products
2. Review Product Impact Analyzer logs for disapprovals between 18-19 Nov
3. Check campaign settings for any changes made on 18-19 Nov
4. Review budget allocation - campaign may have been starved by H&S campaign taking priority

**Timeline:** TODAY
**Time Estimate:** 45 minutes

---

### 3. BMPM Strategic Decision Required (P1 - THIS WEEK)

**Issue:** BMPM brand continues to burn money - 15% ROAS this week, only 1 PMax conversion in 7 days. No signs of improvement since 70% ROAS target set on 11 Nov.

**Impact:** £413 spent this week for £64 return = £349 loss. Extrapolated: £1,500/month loss.

**Action:**
1. Review 30-day performance trend since Nov 11 changes (target ROAS set)
2. Calculate total BMPM losses in Nov 2025
3. **Decision:** Either:
   - **Option A:** Pause BMPM entirely, reallocate £50/day budget to WBS PMax (currently 121% ROAS, could absorb more budget)
   - **Option B:** Continue for 2 more weeks to give 70% target ROAS time to impact algorithm (set only 15 days ago)
   - **Option C:** Reduce BMPM PMax to £20/day minimum, focus only on tablecloth samples (1,088% ROAS product)

**Context:** B2B promotional products may require lead gen approach (forms, quote requests) rather than e-commerce conversion tracking. Current e-commerce setup may be fundamentally misaligned with BMPM buyer journey.

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK (decision meeting with client)
**Time Estimate:** 1 hour analysis + client discussion

---

### 4. Monitor WBS PMax Budget Increase Impact (P2 - NEXT WEEK)

**Issue:** WBS PMax H&S budget increased from £120 to £160/day (API confirmed). ROAS declined 19pp (125% → 106%) as spend increased 179%.

**Impact:** Budget increase generated £528 additional revenue but at lower efficiency. Campaign not yet utilizing full £160 budget (spending avg £123/day). Need to verify this is algorithm learning period vs permanent efficiency decline.

**Action:**
1. Monitor WBS PMax H&S ROAS daily for next 7 days
2. Track daily spend vs £160 budget - currently only spending 77% of budget (£123 avg)
3. If ROAS recovers to 115%+ AND spend increases to £140+/day by 3 Dec, budget increase successful
4. If ROAS remains <110% by 3 Dec, consider reducing back to £120/day
5. Target: 121% ROAS (account average) or better

**Current Budget Status:**
- Budget: £160/day
- Actual daily spend: £123/day (77% utilization)
- Room for growth: £37/day additional capacity

**Timeline:** NEXT WEEK (monitor through 3 Dec)
**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes daily monitoring

---

### 5. ✅ HSG Budget Increase - ALREADY EXECUTED (P2 - COMPLETE)

**Issue:** HSG PMax H&S recovered dramatically this week (86% → 122% ROAS, +49% conv value). Strong momentum.

**Impact:** Budget already increased from £110 to £160/day this week. Results EXCELLENT - spend increased 5% (£757→£794), revenue increased 49% (£652→£970), ROAS improved 36pp (86%→122%).

**Action COMPLETED:**
✅ Budget increased from £110/day to £160/day
✅ ROAS improved whilst scaling (rare achievement)
✅ Revenue increased 49% with only 5% spend increase
✅ Campaign health strong - continued monitoring recommended

**Next Step:** Monitor performance over next 7 days to verify sustainability of 122% ROAS at new budget level. HSG PMax impression share currently 37% - if ROAS remains 115%+, further increase possible.

**Timeline:** MONITORING (through 3 Dec)
**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes daily monitoring

---

### 6. Bagpuss Product Opportunity (P3 - NEXT WEEK)

**Issue:** Two Bagpuss products generated £274 combined revenue this week (£160 + £114) with strong ROAS (157% and 459%).

**Impact:** Niche product with clear demand and strong performance. Opportunity for focused promotion.

**Action:**
1. Check inventory levels for both Bagpuss variants
2. Consider creating dedicated ad group or asset group for Bagpuss products
3. Review search query data for "Bagpuss" terms - may be brand search opportunity
4. Warmies variant especially strong (459% ROAS) - prioritise this SKU

**Context:** Per previous client discussion (Nov 4), Bagpuss ads were advised against due to minimal search volume. However, performance data shows these products ARE converting when served. Worth revisiting.

**Timeline:** NEXT WEEK
**Time Estimate:** 1 hour
