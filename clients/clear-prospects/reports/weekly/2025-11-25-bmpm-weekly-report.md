## Critical Issues Identified

### 🔴 Issue 1: Search Campaign Generating Zero ROI [CRITICAL]

**Problem:**
- Search campaign spent £127.65 this week with ZERO conversions
- Spend increased 41% WoW with no return
- Pure waste of £127.65/week = £6,637/year

**Root Causes (Likely):**
1. Too broad match keywords matching low-intent searches
2. Poor landing page relevance for B2B audience
3. Unrealistic pricing vs competitors
4. Ad copy not resonating with trade buyers

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. **PAUSE THIS CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY** until reviewed
2. Review Search Terms report for last 30 days
3. Analyse which searches triggered ads
4. Rebuild campaign with tighter targeting or pause entirely

**Impact:** Pausing saves £127.65/week = £6,637/year in wasted spend

---

### 🔴 Issue 2: P Max Campaign ROAS Collapsed [CRITICAL]

**Problem:**
- Main P Max campaign dropped from 79% to 20% ROAS (-59pp)
- Only 1.7 conversions this week (down from 2.6 last week)
- Revenue crashed from £279.40 to £75.36 (-73%)

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Product Feed Issues**
   - Check Merchant Centre for disapprovals
   - Verify product pricing is competitive
   - Ensure product descriptions are optimised for B2B

2. **Seasonal Demand**
   - B2B promotional merchandise may have seasonal patterns
   - November may be slower than expected

3. **Competition**
   - Competitors may have launched aggressive promotions
   - Check if impression share dropped

4. **Budget Constraints**
   - Current budget (£70/day) may be too low for efficient algorithm learning
   - However, even with low budget, ROAS should be better than 20%

**Action Required:**
1. Run full account diagnostic
2. Check Merchant Centre feed health
3. Review product pricing vs competitors
4. Analyse Asset Group performance
5. Consider if this business is viable for Google Ads at current pricing/margins

---

### 🔴 Issue 3: CPA Skyrocketed [CRITICAL]

**Problem:**
- CPA increased from £168.24 to £294.03 (+75%)
- With only 1.7 conversions at £294 CPA, this is unsustainable
- Need CPA below £50 for profitable B2B sales

**Action Required:**
1. Review what products are converting (if any)
2. Check if low-value products are driving conversions
3. Assess if tROAS bidding is appropriate (may need tCPA instead)
4. Consider if manual CPC with conversion optimisation is better for low-volume account

### 2. Fundamental Questions to Answer [P0]

Before continuing with this account, these questions need clear answers:

1. **Product-Market Fit**
   - Are these products actually in demand via Google Ads?
   - Is B2B promotional merchandise better suited to LinkedIn/B2B channels?

2. **Pricing & Margins**
   - Are product prices competitive with Amazon/Etsy/competitors?
   - Do margins support £200+ CPA (they likely don't)?

3. **Minimum Order Values**
   - What's the average order value for B2B customers?
   - Is Google Ads attracting B2B or B2C buyers?

4. **Seasonality**
   - Is November historically slow for promotional merchandise?
   - Should budget be paused until peak season?

---

### 3. If Continuing, Restructure Approach [P1]

**Only if decision is made to continue with Google Ads:**

1. **Switch to Lead Generation Model**
   - Instead of direct sales, optimise for quote requests/contact forms
   - Use tCPA bidding targeting £20-30 per lead
   - Nurture leads via email/phone for bulk orders

2. **Hyper-Focus on Winners**
   - Identify the 1-2 products that DO convert
   - Create dedicated campaigns ONLY for these products
   - Pause all other product categories

3. **Landing Page Optimisation**
   - Create B2B-specific landing pages
   - Include bulk pricing/quantity discounts
   - Add trust signals (certifications, case studies, delivery times)

4. **Budget Realignment**
   - Start with £100/week maximum
   - Scale ONLY when ROAS exceeds 100%
   - Don't increase budget until profitability proven

---

### 4. Consider Alternative Channels [P0]

**BMPM may be better suited to:**

1. **LinkedIn Ads** - B2B audience, better targeting for trade buyers
2. **Direct Outreach** - Email marketing to businesses
3. **SEO** - Long-term organic traffic for promotional merchandise searches
4. **Partnerships** - Work with promotional product distributors
5. **Trade Shows** - Physical presence at B2B events

**Recommendation:** Run a cost-benefit analysis comparing Google Ads vs these alternatives.
