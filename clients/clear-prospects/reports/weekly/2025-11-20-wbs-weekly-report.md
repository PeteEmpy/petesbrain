### Campaigns Requiring Attention

#### 🔴 Critical Issue: Overall Account Unprofitable
**Overall ROAS:** 96% (target: 130%)
**Total Spend:** £1,630/week
**Gap to Target:** -34pp below target

**Issue:** Account scaled spend +27% WoW but ROAS dropped 24pp, falling below 100% profitability threshold. Now losing £65/week. Target ROAS is 130%, currently 34pp below.

**Breakdown:**
- Main PMax H&S: £829 spend, 103% ROAS (largest campaign, unprofitable)
- Main Search: £522 spend, 83% ROAS (2nd largest, unprofitable)
- Brand Search: £162 spend, 85% ROAS (unprofitable)
- Zombies: £63 spend, 133% ROAS (only profitable campaign)
- Villains: £54 spend, 118% ROAS (marginally profitable)

**Impact:** £1,630/week at 96% ROAS = £65/week loss vs £489/week profit if at 130% target. **Opportunity cost: £554/week (£2,400/month).**

---

#### 🔴 Critical Issue: Main PMax Campaign Below Target
**Campaign:** CPL | WBS | P Max Shopping | H&S
**Spend:** £829/week (51% of budget)
**ROAS:** 103% (target 120%, was 100% last week)
**Change:** +3pp improvement but still unprofitable

**Issue:** Largest campaign by spend remains unprofitable. Budget was increased from £120/day to £150/day on Nov 11, but performance hasn't improved enough. Spending more into marginal profitability.

**Nov 11 Context:** Budget increased 25% (£120 → £150/day) anticipating improved efficiency at scale, but ROAS only improved from 100% to 103% (+3pp). Budget increase scaled into unprofitable levels.

**Impact:** £829/week at 103% ROAS vs 120% target = £141/week opportunity loss. **Potential monthly gain: £610.**

**Recommendation:** Roll back budget increase to £120/day until ROAS reaches 120%+ consistently.

---

#### 🔴 Critical Issue: Main Search Campaign Unprofitable
**Campaign:** CPL | WBS | Search | Wheat Bags
**Spend:** £522/week (32% of budget)
**ROAS:** 83% (target 110%, was 97% last week)
**Change:** -14pp decline

**Issue:** Second-largest campaign by spend dropping further below profitability. ROAS declined from 97% to 83% despite steady spend. Also suffering from 24% Budget Lost IS (impression share) - not getting enough impressions despite budget.

**Performance Issues:**
- 24% Budget Lost IS - missing 24% of potential impressions
- 67% Rank Lost IS - losing impressions due to low ad rank
- CTR: 6.95% (good engagement)
- Avg CPC: £0.56 (reasonable)

**Impact:** £522/week at 83% ROAS = £89/week loss. If restored to 110% target = +£141/week revenue gain. **Potential monthly gain: £610.**

**Recommendations:**
1. Review Quality Score - low rank suggests QS issues
2. Increase bids to improve rank and capture lost impression share
3. Review search terms for wasted spend
4. Consider if budget should be reduced until efficiency improves

---

#### 🔴 Issue: Brand Search Campaign Unprofitable
**Campaign:** CPL | WBS | Search | Brand Inclusion
**Spend:** £162/week (10% of budget)
**ROAS:** 85% (target 140%, was 117% last week)
**Change:** -32pp decline

**Issue:** Brand Search campaign dropped from profitable 117% to unprofitable 85% (-32pp). Brand terms should be highly profitable (high intent).

**Impact:** £162/week at 85% ROAS = £24/week loss. If restored to 140% target = +£89/week revenue gain. **Potential monthly gain: £386.**

**Recommendation:**
1. Check if brand protection competitors bidding on WheatyBags terms
2. Review search terms for irrelevant queries diluting brand performance
3. Verify trademark protection is active
4. Check landing page experience (brand searches expect homepage)

---

### Campaign Insights

**Bright Spot:** Zombies campaign is only consistently profitable campaign (133% ROAS). Villains improved from 74% to 118% ROAS (+44pp).

**Concern:** 3 of 5 campaigns (representing 93% of spend) are now unprofitable. Budget increase on Nov 11 scaled into worse efficiency, not better.

**Strategic Question:** Should budget be reduced until efficiency returns, or is this a temporary Nov performance dip?

## Week-over-Week Trends

### Daily Performance Pattern

| Metric | Pattern | Observation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Spend** | Sharp increase | +27% WoW (Nov 11 budget increase on H&S) |
| **Conversions** | Moderate increase | +12% but not keeping pace with spend |
| **Revenue** | Minimal growth | +2% despite 27% spend increase |

- Nov 11: H&S PMax budget increased £120 → £150/day
- Nov 11: PRESENCE targeting change on 2 campaigns (Villains, Zombies)
- Budget increase appears premature - should have waited for efficiency to improve first
