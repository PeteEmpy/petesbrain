- 'Them: Something.'
- 'Me: Oh, no.'
- 'Them: And I''ve all disjointed this week. And I just thought, oh, there''s a spirit,
  an email. I''ve just see how we''re getting on, even though I know month ends approaching.
  I thought I''d just see. And then. Yeah, that''s really encouraging. And. I know
  it''s bookturn. Seasonal. And all the rest of it. But even so.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s a bit more than that. I mean, I was quite surprised.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I mean, I''ve seen it upturn. Recently, and I did some analysis a couple of
  weeks ago on why it was. And it was almost like it was describing a death spiral.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That you''re not competitive, so you''re losing impression show, you''re losing
  pressure, so the odds aren''t showing, so therefore, I need to just keep on going
  down.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. And it''s been doing that. For considerably. Long time. Like
  a couple of years almost, in fields.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. And it was, you know, this. You know, when you''re thinking about.
  You think just there''s something in your back of your head, you go, there''s something
  fundamentally not writing.'
- 'Them: Yeah. There is. I know. I know.'
- 'Me: And it''s, you know, you. You always say that. You know, you always come back.
  Is it this? Is it this? Is it. This. And, you know, you. You throw some. You throw
  some weird at me, and I just go, oh, no, it can''t be that. Then you look at it.
  You go, oh, actually.'
- 'Them: Great.'
- 'Me: It might be, you know what it means, and that''s why it''s.'
- 'Them: Yeah. But I do that with the tech guide as well. And they''re like, no, I
  think it''s really defensive. And no. And then they calmed down a bit and then they
  go, actually, you found something there.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it''s, it''s worth it. It''s worth coming
  from left field, you know, it''s, it''s, it''s worth hearing that and it''s, you
  know, there''s, you know what I''m like with the speed on the site, it does me heading.'
- 'Them: Just. Different eyes.'
- 'Me: And you wouldn''t have thought, you know, if I. If I had just gone straight
  in and analyzed that data, that all it''s. It''s going to be bounce rate. If bounce
  rate comes down, then that''s good. But then you. Then you pair that up with everything
  else.'
- 'Them: Absolutely. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And you start to look at the roas and say, hang on a minute, you know, and
  there''s been a load of other. There''s been structure changes and stuff that, that
  have been going on and what have you. But I think that''s a fundamental part of
  it that was the missing link, because you''re looking at. You think it doesn''t
  matter what I change? Nothing''s going to happen. And I''m kind of running out of
  ideas at that point. You know, when you keep just dropping target roas, it''s just
  to stimulate it all. So it''s interesting. Yeah.'
- 'Them: The. Bounce rate. Was fascinating. And I totally get where you''re coming
  from as well. Is that, I suppose, then it allows you to reconsider that bounce rate
  to say, right? The bounce rate has gone higher. And we know the people who are not
  interested are bouncing off the side. They''re going. Nah, that''s not me. But that
  allows it to also fluctuate. That apparent negativity flags up with you to say,
  well, how relevant are the ads as well?'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: But it''s good. And it''s a better way of looking at it. I bounce rate. People
  that are sticking around. And converting and all the rest of it.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: I don''t know. So hard, but it''s interesting. I find that. Feedbacks is
  the one that''s taken the upturn. Now, it has been exceptionally cold. That helped.'
- 'Me: She did? Yeah.'
- 'Them: But. It''s the. Other stats like. The stats on costs coming down. And con.
  Versions going. Well. Everything is turned positively.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Now, you did say. Oh, you didn''t sell weedy bags? It''s constrained by budget.
  What''s happening there?'
- 'Me: Well, I''m. I''m turning the budget up. I''ve. I''ve been cautious on the.
  On the budget, not, not let it be limited by budget, but obviously with it, with
  it being Black Friday tomorrow, I''ve turned the budget up to, you know, to give
  it an overhead.'
- 'Them: Okay? Watch the roas on weedy bags the last two weeks. I can''t remember
  understanding, like, 90% up or something.'
- 'Me: Which. Yeah, something like that. Let me just. The. The other. The other big
  thing for yours is the. Is the. The conversion lag. It does take a long time for
  the data to come in.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s what we''re saying. 1.1.'
- 'Them: So. It''s not all.'
- 'Me: Yeah, but that''s. It''s. It''s one. It''s this. It''s the search campaign,
  which is pulling it down. Let me just take that back another day. Because it should
  take 24 hours to bring all the data in. But it''s 1.17. So we''re on a. We''re on
  a 120 target at the moment on there. I don''t take it any lower than that. We just
  copy it completely.'
- 'Them: Which is tiny, isn''t it? Absolutely tiny.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it is. Yeah. But, you know, there are. There are some. Comforting bits
  in there. You know, the actual trend is upwards, which is what we want.'
- 'Them: Well, it is. Yeah. I think the only bit that was missing was in those stats
  was re used this and everything. This, that and the other. But what''s the margin
  being reported out? That is money terms, not just percentage, because it could be
  looking absolutely amazing for 150 quid in the bottom line, you know.'
- 'Me: Yeah. It wasn''t designed to be a month end report. It was just a report on
  what you have.'
- 'Them: No. No, it''s a throw. Something together. But. It was really interesting.
  I.'
- 'Me: Just thrown something together.'
- 'Them: Don''t. I don''t. Know, no idea what. ''s going on? With hanks. You are.'
- 'Me: It took me about an hour and a half to create that.'
- 'Them: Oh, it''s fantastic. No, it''s. You say you were. Your words. You said, it''s
  not non vendor. I''m like, no, it''s really interesting.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Them: And I can tell you, Brittany, like with tangents, you go off on, and it''s
  brilliant.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, it''s the system.'
- 'Them: What''s happening? That gift. ''s doing in. Terms of your head, I mean.'
- 'Me: What''s more, terry,'
- 'Them: That. ''s just brutal. Where''s happysap gifts at in terms of this weekend?
  In your head. Because the stats were encouraging, but not. It''s not as good as
  we keep out, was it?'
- 'Me: Well, if you look at the last the last 14 days for happy snap gifts, it''s
  1.45.'
- 'Them: Oh, right. Yeah, that was it. No, no, no. That was good.'
- 'Me: You know, so it''s. It''s not. It''s not. It''s not bad.'
- 'Them: Sorry. Yeah. No, it''s a lot better than it was. It was the other way around.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And again, that''s making sure that''s not constrained at all.'
- 'Them: No, exactly. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because that''s. That''s been the one where there''s been the competition,
  you know, that''s the one that''s been batted from the Far East.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So for that to be pulling round again, see, I''ve completely restructured that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it seems to be working well, you know, when you''ve got 179 conversions
  the last 14 days, that means the algorithm''s got something to work on.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, there''s. There''s an advantage to be splitting campaigns up and
  being able to control them separately, but they need to have enough conversions
  for the algorithm to work.'
- 'Them: I see what you mean. Yes. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: So, yeah, that seems to be starting to hold its own. It''s just. Whether it''s
  too late or not, that''s the thing. You know, it''s, it''s, it''s been a case. A
  lot of this has been a case of waiting. And I''ve been. I''ve been a little bit
  guilty sometimes in making decisions too quickly and not having enough data, you
  know, so it really has been holding your nerve and just going, no. I think this
  is the right thing to do.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah, yeah, yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it''s. Yeah, seems to be. It seems to be the right thing to do.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Sorry. Go on.'
- 'Me: I was going to say those bastards with the photo face masks that have been
  killing us.'
- 'Them: Well. I know. Exactly. And I just don''t know what to do about that because
  I just don''t know what we can do. We can''t sell any cheaper.'
- 'Me: Well, yeah, it''s, it''s, yeah, it''s changing. It''s changing the message,
  you know, it''s, it''s, it''s, it''s doing what we''re doing. It''s like. It''s
  not very sexy. Just saying, let''s just make the site faster, but that''s you know,
  that''s the way it works.'
- 'Them: Famous people. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Make it easy for people to do it and, you know.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Well, also the checkout is helping as well because we''ve got the
  new system and you check out Flow, which has got Apple Pay on there as well, which
  for mobile purchases is so quick.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Oh, it says. Yeah, it says, I love it.'
- 'Them: So double click and you job done.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. And it''s, you know, I, I, the one thing I''m wrestling with at
  the moment is how we''re going to measure the effect of people using chat GPT. I
  mean, that''s coming. Chat GPT shopping is coming next year, probably early, first
  or second quarter.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, but it''s not just chat GPT, is it? It''s. It''s whether Google
  can keep up with theirs. I just don''t know whether they will be able to.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, the sexy thing with Chat GPT is that they''re. They''re doing this
  shopping on Chat GPT. She just presses Chat GPT and it transacts on Chat GPT and
  sends you the. Send you the. The. The transaction you''ll check out. Now, they''re
  starting this off with shopify. So there''s going to be a plugin in Shopify. They''ve
  done a deal with Chat GPT.'
- 'Them: Curious.'
- 'Me: Which enables all that, but they will have to be then producing an API that
  allows other people to do it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Gosh.'
- 'Me: I''d sent you that email the other day about Etsy doing it and they just, they,
  they push the, increase the sales massively as a result of it. But, you know, it''s
  not necessarily increasing your sales, it''s just moving them around, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah, it is. Yeah, but we''ve got to be careful we don''t move. They
  that sales don''t get moved around.'
- 'Me: You know? Yeah.'
- 'Them: Our foot.'
- 'Me: Yes, that''s right. Yes.'
- 'Them: And that''s what, you know, that''s what has happened in regards to, you
  know, Google''s ability to mess around with things. So, I don''t know.'
- 'Me: Yeah, well, you know, in the past, it''s been. It''s. It''s been a case of,
  like, you know, if you''re not on mobile, then you''re going to lose it.'
- 'Them: Exactly. Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, if you don''t have this, if you don''t have that, it''s like Apple
  pay you. You''re losing out to other people who do have these things. So then that''s
  why you''ve got to keep running with it all the time.'
- 'Them: Exactly.'
- 'Me: But yeah.'
- 'Them: Trade will be interesting, so it''ll start dropping off. And this morning
  we''re still getting stupid inquiries for Christmas products. As in, can you deliver
  4,000 branded Man City Christmas hats for a week on Friday? No, nobody can. You
  know, literally nobody can. But given a weak extra, yes, I could.'
- 'Me: Wow. Wow. Wow.'
- 'Them: In the Far east and get them air freighted over, but that week is too late.
  Because Christmas is over, but for them by then, you see. So we''re still. We''re
  still getting the inquiries, but they''re starting to become undeliverable. And
  just so you know as well, we''re planning this year to shut down over Christmas.
  We haven''t done this for 12, 15 years. But we are shutting down. So we''ve got.
  I don''t know what days it is. It''s over the Christmas period. We''re shook.'
- 'Me: Yes. Okay?'
- 'Them: It''s just to save costs. Because what we''ve done is we''ve said any extra
  time you work, you can take us time off over Christmas. So basically, everyone''s
  quite happy working away to get the time off, you see, so it''s great. I thought,
  well, we''ll see what happens with inquiries and, you know, frustration and stuff
  like that with customers. We''ll just see.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s different.'
- 'Them: But trade will. Will drop off very, very soon. So in theory, the demand on
  ads should cull itself, so to speak, without us having to intervene. That''s the
  theory.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. The volume will go down. It''s always the case. It''s, it''s. It''s.
  It goes into autopilot.'
- 'Them: Yeah. But it was nice to see to spend this month''s going to be about 1,500
  quid rather than three and a half grand, you know, previously and stuff like that,
  so.'
- 'Me: You know? And that''s an easy one to control, you know, But I. It''s. It goes.
  It goes against all sensibilities. When you look at their asses, it''s not making
  any money.'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: On Google Ads. It''s not making any money, but it''s how that percolates its
  way through in terms of new customers. So.'
- 'Them: But. Yeah, exactly. And the brand owners that we are getting that might need
  tiny spend at this stage, might need us for bigger spend next year and stuff like
  that, you just never know.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: No, I don''t know. I don''t know what to do. I''m going to hope. I''m sort
  of thinking that the demand for ads being served is the thing that will cull the
  spend in December rather than us going. Right, let''s pause because I don''t want
  to destroy the algorithms, but we''ll just see.'
- 'Me: We can always turn the. We can always turn the. The budgets down, though.'
- 'Them: Well, yeah, exactly. Just concentrate. Yeah, exactly. And that''s what I''m
  going to be doing next week because it''s month end. Is quickly getting onto trade
  and seeing if trade needs throttling, basically.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Which it probably will. So in December, my aim is we won''t be spending hardly
  anything on trade ads.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So, anyway. Yeah, that''s next week. That''s where I''m here.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Good. Right. Okay, then. I was just touching base.'
- 'Me: Yeah, not a problem. Mate.'
- 'Them: Fingers crossed. Let''s see what happens. Lovely.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yes.'
- 'Them: But, yeah, encouraging.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'

- Me: Well, if you look at the last the last 14 days for happy snap gifts, it's 1.45.
- Them: Oh, right. Yeah, that was it. No, no, no. That was good.
- Me: You know, so it's. It's not. It's not. It's not bad.
- Them: Sorry. Yeah. No, it's a lot better than it was. It was the other way around.
- Me: Yeah. And again, that's making sure that's not constrained at all.
- Them: No, exactly. Yeah.
- Me: Because that's. That's been the one where there's been the competition, you know, that's the one that's been batted from the Far East.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So for that to be pulling round again, see, I've completely restructured that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it seems to be working well, you know, when you've got 179 conversions the last 14 days, that means the algorithm's got something to work on.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You know, there's. There's an advantage to be splitting campaigns up and being able to control them separately, but they need to have enough conversions for the algorithm to work.
- Them: I see what you mean. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
- Me: So, yeah, that seems to be starting to hold its own. It's just. Whether it's too late or not, that's the thing. You know, it's, it's, it's been a case. A lot of this has been a case of waiting. And I've been. I've been a little bit guilty sometimes in making decisions too quickly and not having enough data, you know, so it really has been holding your nerve and just going, no. I think this is the right thing to do.
- Them: Y. Eah, yeah, yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: And it's. Yeah, seems to be. It seems to be the right thing to do.
- Them: Y. Eah. Sorry. Go on.
- Me: I was going to say those bastards with the photo face masks that have been killing us.
- Them: Well. I know. Exactly. And I just don't know what to do about that because I just don't know what we can do. We can't sell any cheaper.
- Me: Well, yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's changing. It's changing the message, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's doing what we're doing. It's like. It's not very sexy. Just saying, let's just make the site faster, but that's you know, that's the way it works.
- Them: Famous people. Yeah.
- Me: Make it easy for people to do it and, you know.
- Them: Y. Eah. Well, also the checkout is helping as well because we've got the new system and you check out Flow, which has got Apple Pay on there as well, which for mobile purchases is so quick.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Oh, it says. Yeah, it says, I love it.
- Them: So double click and you job done.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. And it's, you know, I, I, the one thing I'm wrestling with at the moment is how we're going to measure the effect of people using chat GPT. I mean, that's coming. Chat GPT shopping is coming next year, probably early, first or second quarter.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, but it's not just chat GPT, is it? It's. It's whether Google can keep up with theirs. I just don't know whether they will be able to.
- Me: Yeah. Well, the sexy thing with Chat GPT is that they're. They're doing this shopping on Chat GPT. She just presses Chat GPT and it transacts on Chat GPT and sends you the. Send you the. The. The transaction you'll check out. Now, they're starting this off with shopify. So there's going to be a plugin in Shopify. They've done a deal with Chat GPT.
- Them: Curious.
- Me: Which enables all that, but they will have to be then producing an API that allows other people to do it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Gosh.
- Me: I'd sent you that email the other day about Etsy doing it and they just, they, they push the, increase the sales massively as a result of it. But, you know, it's not necessarily increasing your sales, it's just moving them around, isn't it?
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah, it is. Yeah, but we've got to be careful we don't move. They that sales don't get moved around.
- Me: You know? Yeah.
- Them: Our foot.
- Me: Yes, that's right. Yes.
- Them: And that's what, you know, that's what has happened in regards to, you know, Google's ability to mess around with things. So, I don't know.
- Me: Yeah, well, you know, in the past, it's been. It's. It's been a case of, like, you know, if you're not on mobile, then you're going to lose it.
- Them: Exactly. Yeah.
- Me: You know, if you don't have this, if you don't have that, it's like Apple pay you. You're losing out to other people who do have these things. So then that's why you've got to keep running with it all the time.
- Them: Exactly.
- Me: But yeah.
- Them: Trade will be interesting, so it'll start dropping off. And this morning we're still getting stupid inquiries for Christmas products. As in, can you deliver 4,000 branded Man City Christmas hats for a week on Friday? No, nobody can. You know, literally nobody can. But given a weak extra, yes, I could.
- Me: Wow. Wow. Wow.
- Them: In the Far east and get them air freighted over, but that week is too late. Because Christmas is over, but for them by then, you see. So we're still. We're still getting the inquiries, but they're starting to become undeliverable. And just so you know as well, we're planning this year to shut down over Christmas. We haven't done this for 12, 15 years. But we are shutting down. So we've got. I don't know what days it is. It's over the Christmas period. We're shook.
- Me: Yes. Okay?
- Them: It's just to save costs. Because what we've done is we've said any extra time you work, you can take us time off over Christmas. So basically, everyone's quite happy working away to get the time off, you see, so it's great. I thought, well, we'll see what happens with inquiries and, you know, frustration and stuff like that with customers. We'll just see.
- Me: Yeah, it's different.
- Them: But trade will. Will drop off very, very soon. So in theory, the demand on ads should cull itself, so to speak, without us having to intervene. That's the theory.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. The volume will go down. It's always the case. It's, it's. It's. It goes into autopilot.
- Them: Yeah. But it was nice to see to spend this month's going to be about 1,500 quid rather than three and a half grand, you know, previously and stuff like that, so.
- Me: You know? And that's an easy one to control, you know, But I. It's. It goes. It goes against all sensibilities. When you look at their asses, it's not making any money.
- Them: No.
- Me: On Google Ads. It's not making any money, but it's how that percolates its way through in terms of new customers. So.
- Them: But. Yeah, exactly. And the brand owners that we are getting that might need tiny spend at this stage, might need us for bigger spend next year and stuff like that, you just never know.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: No, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I'm going to hope. I'm sort of thinking that the demand for ads being served is the thing that will cull the spend in December rather than us going. Right, let's pause because I don't want to destroy the algorithms, but we'll just see.
- Me: We can always turn the. We can always turn the. The budgets down, though.
- Them: Well, yeah, exactly. Just concentrate. Yeah, exactly. And that's what I'm going to be doing next week because it's month end. Is quickly getting onto trade and seeing if trade needs throttling, basically.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Which it probably will. So in December, my aim is we won't be spending hardly anything on trade ads.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So, anyway. Yeah, that's next week. That's where I'm here.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Good. Right. Okay, then. I was just touching base.
- Me: Yeah, not a problem. Mate.
- Them: Fingers crossed. Let's see what happens. Lovely.
- Me: Yeah. Yes.
- Them: But, yeah, encouraging.
- Me: Yeah.

Them: Something.
Me: Oh, no.
Them: And I've all disjointed this week. And I just thought, oh, there's a spirit, an email. I've just see how we're getting on, even though I know month ends approaching. I thought I'd just see. And then. Yeah, that's really encouraging. And. I know it's bookturn. Seasonal. And all the rest of it. But even so.
Me: Yeah, it's a bit more than that. I mean, I was quite surprised.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I mean, I've seen it upturn. Recently, and I did some analysis a couple of weeks ago on why it was. And it was almost like it was describing a death spiral.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That you're not competitive, so you're losing impression show, you're losing pressure, so the odds aren't showing, so therefore, I need to just keep on going down.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And it's been doing that. For considerably. Long time. Like a couple of years almost, in fields.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. And it was, you know, this. You know, when you're thinking about. You think just there's something in your back of your head, you go, there's something fundamentally not writing.
Them: Yeah. There is. I know. I know.
Me: And it's, you know, you. You always say that. You know, you always come back. Is it this? Is it this? Is it. This. And, you know, you. You throw some. You throw some weird at me, and I just go, oh, no, it can't be that. Then you look at it. You go, oh, actually.
Them: Great.
Me: It might be, you know what it means, and that's why it's.
Them: Yeah. But I do that with the tech guide as well. And they're like, no, I think it's really defensive. And no. And then they calmed down a bit and then they go, actually, you found something there.
Me: Yeah, it's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's, it's worth it. It's worth coming from left field, you know, it's, it's, it's worth hearing that and it's, you know, there's, you know what I'm like with the speed on the site, it does me heading.
Them: Just. Different eyes.
Me: And you wouldn't have thought, you know, if I. If I had just gone straight in and analyzed that data, that all it's. It's going to be bounce rate. If bounce rate comes down, then that's good. But then you. Then you pair that up with everything else.
Them: Absolutely. Yeah.
Me: And you start to look at the roas and say, hang on a minute, you know, and there's been a load of other. There's been structure changes and stuff that, that have been going on and what have you. But I think that's a fundamental part of it that was the missing link, because you're looking at. You think it doesn't matter what I change? Nothing's going to happen. And I'm kind of running out of ideas at that point. You know, when you keep just dropping target roas, it's just to stimulate it all. So it's interesting. Yeah.
Them: The. Bounce rate. Was fascinating. And I totally get where you're coming from as well. Is that, I suppose, then it allows you to reconsider that bounce rate to say, right? The bounce rate has gone higher. And we know the people who are not interested are bouncing off the side. They're going. Nah, that's not me. But that allows it to also fluctuate. That apparent negativity flags up with you to say, well, how relevant are the ads as well?
Me: Yes.
Them: But it's good. And it's a better way of looking at it. I bounce rate. People that are sticking around. And converting and all the rest of it.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Them: I don't know. So hard, but it's interesting. I find that. Feedbacks is the one that's taken the upturn. Now, it has been exceptionally cold. That helped.
Me: She did? Yeah.
Them: But. It's the. Other stats like. The stats on costs coming down. And con. Versions going. Well. Everything is turned positively.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Them: Now, you did say. Oh, you didn't sell weedy bags? It's constrained by budget. What's happening there?
Me: Well, I'm. I'm turning the budget up. I've. I've been cautious on the. On the budget, not, not let it be limited by budget, but obviously with it, with it being Black Friday tomorrow, I've turned the budget up to, you know, to give it an overhead.
Them: Okay? Watch the roas on weedy bags the last two weeks. I can't remember understanding, like, 90% up or something.
Me: Which. Yeah, something like that. Let me just. The. The other. The other big thing for yours is the. Is the. The conversion lag. It does take a long time for the data to come in.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That's what we're saying. 1.1.
Them: So. It's not all.
Me: Yeah, but that's. It's. It's one. It's this. It's the search campaign, which is pulling it down. Let me just take that back another day. Because it should take 24 hours to bring all the data in. But it's 1.17. So we're on a. We're on a 120 target at the moment on there. I don't take it any lower than that. We just copy it completely.
Them: Which is tiny, isn't it? Absolutely tiny.
Me: Yeah, it is. Yeah. But, you know, there are. There are some. Comforting bits in there. You know, the actual trend is upwards, which is what we want.
Them: Well, it is. Yeah. I think the only bit that was missing was in those stats was re used this and everything. This, that and the other. But what's the margin being reported out? That is money terms, not just percentage, because it could be looking absolutely amazing for 150 quid in the bottom line, you know.
Me: Yeah. It wasn't designed to be a month end report. It was just a report on what you have.
Them: No. No, it's a throw. Something together. But. It was really interesting. I.
Me: Just thrown something together.
Them: Don't. I don't. Know, no idea what. 's going on? With hanks. You are.
Me: It took me about an hour and a half to create that.
Them: Oh, it's fantastic. No, it's. You say you were. Your words. You said, it's not non vendor. I'm like, no, it's really interesting.
Me: Yeah, yeah.
Them: And I can tell you, Brittany, like with tangents, you go off on, and it's brilliant.
Me: Yeah. Well, it's the system.
Them: What's happening? That gift. 's doing in. Terms of your head, I mean.
Me: What's more, terry,
Them: That. 's just brutal. Where's happysap gifts at in terms of this weekend? In your head. Because the stats were encouraging, but not. It's not as good as we keep out, was it?
Me: Well, if you look at the last the last 14 days for happy snap gifts, it's 1.45.
Them: Oh, right. Yeah, that was it. No, no, no. That was good.
Me: You know, so it's. It's not. It's not. It's not bad.
Them: Sorry. Yeah. No, it's a lot better than it was. It was the other way around.
Me: Yeah. And again, that's making sure that's not constrained at all.
Them: No, exactly. Yeah.
Me: Because that's. That's been the one where there's been the competition, you know, that's the one that's been batted from the Far East.

And I've been. I've been a little bit guilty sometimes in making decisions too quickly and not having enough data, you know, so it really has been holding your nerve and just going, no. I think this is the right thing to do.
Them: Y. Eah, yeah, yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: And it's. Yeah, seems to be. It seems to be the right thing to do.
Them: Y. Eah. Sorry. Go on.
Me: I was going to say those bastards with the photo face masks that have been killing us.
Them: Well. I know. Exactly. And I just don't know what to do about that because I just don't know what we can do. We can't sell any cheaper.
Me: Well, yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's changing. It's changing the message, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's doing what we're doing. It's like. It's not very sexy. Just saying, let's just make the site faster, but that's you know, that's the way it works.

Them: Exactly.
Me: But yeah.
Them: Trade will be interesting, so it'll start dropping off. And this morning we're still getting stupid inquiries for Christmas products. As in, can you deliver 4,000 branded Man City Christmas hats for a week on Friday? No, nobody can. You know, literally nobody can. But given a weak extra, yes, I could.
Me: Wow. Wow. Wow.
Them: In the Far east and get them air freighted over, but that week is too late. Because Christmas is over, but for them by then, you see. So we're still. We're still getting the inquiries, but they're starting to become undeliverable. And just so you know as well, we're planning this year to shut down over Christmas.
