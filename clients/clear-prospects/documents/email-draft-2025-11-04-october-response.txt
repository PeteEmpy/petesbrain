Subject: Re: Month end notes Oct25

Hi Michael,

Thanks for the October numbers - really pleased to see the progress we're making on the profitability front. Let me address your key points and questions:

**WheatyBags - October Success**

This is exactly what we've been working towards. Google ad costs hitting 25% of revenue for the first time this year is a major milestone. The profit-focused strategy is working perfectly for WBS:

• £620 profit after management costs (vs losses earlier in year)
• 25% ad cost ratio (down from 29% in Sep) - bang on target
• Stable efficiency at £0.70 profit per click
• Strong traffic growth vs last October (670k impressions up from 559k last Oct)

The timing couldn't be better as we head into peak heating season. With colder weather driving natural demand, we should see this profitability maintained or improved through November-December.

**HappySnapGifts - Profitable Efficiency, Lower Volume**

The numbers tell an interesting story here. Yes, volume has halved BUT the efficiency metrics are exceptional:

• 21% ad cost ratio (down from 32-34% throughout 2025) - excellent progress towards target
• £1.31 profit per click (up from £0.84 in Oct 2024) - 55% improvement
• £3.00 revenue per click (up from £2.01 in Oct 2024) - highest in years
• £547 profit before management allocation - essentially break-even

You asked: "Is there nothing we can do on Face Masks but especially Photo Cushions?"

**YES - Face Masks Analysis & Actions Taken:**

I've completed a deep 6-month analysis of face mask performance and found something significant. The product line ISN'T dying - it was being killed by inefficient channel allocation:

**"Personalised Face Masks" Case Study (6-month data):**
• June-August 2025: LOSING MONEY at 83-93% ROAS
• Current performance (November): 292% ROAS - highly profitable
• What changed: Shopping campaigns were getting clicks but zero conversions. When we consolidated into Search with AI Max bidding (Sep 15), performance transformed.

**Channel Performance Gap:**
Search campaigns: 142% ROAS average
Shopping/PMax: 44% ROAS average

**Actions Taken (Nov 4):**
I've identified 6 high-priority search terms (including "personalised face masks", "photo masks uk", "hen do face masks", etc.) where Search dramatically outperforms Shopping. Added exact match negatives to all PMax campaigns to protect the profitable Search traffic.

Expected impact: £300-600/month efficiency gain by eliminating budget waste and protecting high-performing channels.

**The principle:** Shopping isn't always best for product queries. For face masks, searchers have specific customisation intent that Search campaigns handle better. This is the kind of systematic optimisation that saves product lines rather than cutting them.

**Photo Cushions:** Need to run the same analysis. May be a similar channel allocation issue rather than product decline. Will investigate this week.

**BMPM - Restructure Impact**

The Oct 21 restructure is showing early positive signs:

• Google costs at 7% of revenue - well within 10% target
• Loss reduced to £715 (from £1,281 with management costs) - moving in right direction
• New Search campaign launched targeting cushions with AI Max bidding
• PMax budget reduced to £50/day to focus on profitable channels
• Paused underperforming categories (branded mugs, coasters, napkins) early October

The challenge with small conversion values (£500 total) suggests we're attracting explorers rather than committed buyers. However, as you noted, larger orders (like the £8k Mosaic/Blankets client) may have a long consideration cycle where initial ad exposure influences later direct purchases.

Recommendation: Continue current approach through November to give AI Max bidding time to optimise (6-8 week learning period from Oct 21 launch). Review again mid-December with full data.

**Peak Season Outlook**

Both WBS and HSG are now entering their peak periods:

• WBS: Cold weather driving natural demand uplift
• HSG: Christmas gifting season (photo products, cushions, bunting)
• Both sites now profitable or break-even going INTO peak vs bleeding money

The profit-focused strategy means we're positioned to capitalise on seasonal demand at sustainable economics rather than driving unprofitable volume.

**Strategic Summary**

October marks a turning point:

1. WBS: Achieved 25% cost target for first time in 2025 ✓
2. HSG: Achieved 21% cost target, broke even, highest efficiency metrics in years ✓
3. BMPM: Reduced losses by 44%, within 7% cost target ✓
4. Channel optimisation work protecting profitable traffic patterns ✓
5. Entering peak season from position of profitability not losses ✓

The volume drops are the cost of achieving profitability, but the face masks analysis shows we can recover some volume by ensuring traffic goes through the RIGHT channels. Not every product needs to be cut - some just need better campaign structure.


**A Quick Note on the Analysis Behind This**

You might be wondering how I'm able to dive this deep into the data - the 6-month face masks analysis, the channel performance comparisons, spotting these patterns. I've been building out an AI-assisted research system specifically for your account (and my other clients) that's proving invaluable.

It's not about AI writing reports automatically - far from it. What I've built is more like having a very diligent research assistant that can quickly analyse months of historical data, cross-reference campaign changes with performance shifts, and spot patterns that would take me days to find manually. But the interpretation, strategy, and recommendations are still very much mine based on years of experience.

For your business specifically, I maintain a detailed context file that captures everything we've tried, what's worked, what hasn't, your goals, the constraints we're working within. Every email we exchange, every experiment we run, every insight from the data gets logged. This means when I'm analysing performance, I've got the full historical context at my fingertips rather than trying to remember what we did three months ago.

A few examples of how it's working in practice:

• The face masks analysis - the AI helped me pull and compare 6 months of search term data across multiple campaign types, but spotting that Shopping was cannibalising Search traffic and knowing what to do about it, that's the human bit.

• Bagpuss product tracking - when you asked me to monitor that specific product now you've reintroduced it, I logged it in the system as a tracked experiment. Now I'm automatically monitoring its week-by-week performance through the Christmas period without having to manually pull reports each time. This kind of product-level tracking means I can spot early if something's working or needs adjustment, rather than discovering issues in monthly reviews.

• Merchant Centre disapprovals monitoring - this is a big one. The system now checks all three of your Merchant Centre accounts (HappySnapGifts, WheatyBags, BMPM) every 6 hours for product disapprovals. If any products get disapproved or the disapproval count increases, I get an immediate alert. This means I can request re-indexing within hours rather than discovering issues days later when revenue has already dropped. It's essentially 24/7 monitoring that catches feed problems before they significantly impact performance.

It's ongoing work - I'm constantly refining how the system tracks patterns, flags issues, and helps me understand what's driving your performance.

The practical benefit for you is that I can now do this kind of deep-dive analysis regularly rather than occasionally, catch issues faster, and give you much more specific answers to questions like "what's happening with face masks?" It'll only get better as the system learns more about your business patterns.

Anyway, thought you'd appreciate knowing what's behind the analysis. Happy to walk you through it in more detail if you're interested.

Best regards,
Peter
