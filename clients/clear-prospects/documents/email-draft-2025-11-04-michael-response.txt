Subject: Re: October Month-End - Actions & Analysis

Hi Michael,

Glad you found the analysis useful - and yes, the AI system is proving invaluable for this kind of deep-dive work. Let me address your specific requests:

**1. FACE MASK SEARCH TERMS ANALYSIS** - It's More Nuanced Than I Suggested

When I said "6 high-priority terms" in my last email, I oversimplified. Let me explain what I actually found:

**What I Did**: Added "personalised face masks" as a negative keyword to Shopping/PMax campaigns because Search was outperforming Shopping for that specific term.

**The Reality**: After analysing 3 months of data (Aug-Nov), most face mask search terms DON'T follow a simple "Search good, Shopping bad" pattern.

**Examples**:
- "personalised face masks" - Search wins (124% ROAS), Shopping wasn't converting
- "hen do face masks" - Only appearing in Search anyway (148% ROAS)
- "cardboard face masks" - Shopping WINS massively (443% ROAS vs 204% in Search)
- "personalised face masks uk" - Shopping WINS (316% ROAS vs 41% in Search)

**For Your SEO/Content Strategy**:

Rather than "add these 6 specific terms," focus on the themes that drive conversions across BOTH channels:

**Core Themes**:
1. **Personalisation/customisation** - "personalised", "customised", "photo face masks"
2. **Events/occasions** - "hen do", "stag do", "birthday", "party"
3. **Speed/delivery** - "next day delivery", "quick delivery"
4. **UK focus** - Many searches include "uk"
5. **Types** - "cardboard", "printed", "photo"

**Content Approach**:
- Product pages should cover customisation process (upload photo, preview, order)
- Create use-case content (hen party ideas, birthday surprises, wedding props)
- Emphasise fast UK delivery throughout
- Let Google decide which channel (Search or Shopping) works best for each specific query

The face masks turnaround wasn't about "6 magic keywords" - it was about identifying ONE term where Search dramatically outperformed Shopping, then protecting it. Each term needs individual analysis.


**2. PHOTO CUSHIONS ANALYSIS** - Underway

You asked for this "sooner the better" - I'm on it. Running the same channel performance analysis (Search vs Shopping) for cushion terms. Will have recommendations for you by end of week.


**3. BUNTING CORRECTION** - Noted

You're right - bunting is summer wedding season, not Christmas. Updated my notes.


**4. BAGPUSS & TOY HEAT PACKS** - Can't Analyse Properly

I tried to pull year-on-year data for Bagpuss products, but the historic data isn't available for the same period last year. Recent data (Aug-Nov 2025) shows minimal search volume - only 10 total impressions across all Bagpuss-related terms with zero clicks.

Given you mentioned the supplier isn't competitive and the product category is challenging, I'd recommend:

**Don't turn toy heat pack ads back on** - at least not without solving the supplier/pricing issue first. Even if we got clicks, we'd need exceptional conversion rates to make it work with uncompetitive pricing.

If you need to move remaining inventory, better to do it through non-ad channels (email to existing customers, clearance pricing) rather than ad spend.


**5. DISAPPROVALS MONITORING** - Glad This Helps!

It's already caught issues twice since I deployed it last week. Every 6 hours it checks all three Merchant Center accounts and alerts me if anything drops. Much better than finding out days later when revenue has already tanked.


**NEXT STEPS**

1. **Photo Cushions Analysis** - I'll complete this by end of week and send recommendations

2. **Face Mask SEO Content** - Use the 5 core themes (personalisation, events, speed, UK focus, types) rather than specific keyword stuffing

3. **Bagpuss Products** - Live but not very hopeful on performance.

I'll get you the cushions analysis shortly.

Regards,

Peter
