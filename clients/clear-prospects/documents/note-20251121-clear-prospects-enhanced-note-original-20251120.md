[05/09/2024, 13:46:39] Sam Amdjadi: Hi @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩ , Peter and I have been talking but in short, the Fellow ads are back up and running. We’ll need to obtain stock on one or two lines in meantime
[05/09/2024, 13:46:46] Sam Amdjadi: Fellow Tally in particular
[05/09/2024, 13:49:32] Zoe Godshot: Ok sounds good
[05/09/2024, 21:14:25] Sam Amdjadi: Hi @⁨Peter Empson⁩ any chance you could review us here? Unfortunately we had an issue in that a disgruntled young ex employee who had embarked on a campaign of negative reviews via her friends. We managed to have almost all of them removed earlier today by taking legal advice. That said, our rating which was previously 4.9 still hasn’t got back to that. Long story short, we need reviews and dont’ want to pester too many customers. 

https://g.page/r/Cd4vDImMUIPDEAE/review
[05/09/2024, 21:18:38] Peter Empson: Ok
[05/09/2024, 21:27:05] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks 🙌
[06/09/2024, 12:57:48] Peter Empson: Do you have a contact at your hosting provider? I am constantly getting 502 gateway errors when trying to download the data feed and CHannable say we need to look in the server logs
[06/09/2024, 13:32:34] Sam Amdjadi: so its WP Engine and I’m going to add you just now as a technical contact
[06/09/2024, 13:32:53] Sam Amdjadi: Seems you’re already added
[06/09/2024, 13:33:30] Sam Amdjadi: heres the email I’ve used to correspond with them in the past: 

support+id6882583@wpengine.zendesk.com
[06/09/2024, 14:01:15] Peter Empson: Great, I’ll get in touch with them ‎<This message was edited>
[09/09/2024, 14:38:32] Sam Amdjadi: *New brand - Anglepoise* 

I’m in the process of making a considerable investment to try and onboard this brand. I wanted to find out how strong this is from an online point of view. They certainly have a strong name in the UK and the 90 mini mini series seems popular. @⁨Peter Empson⁩ can you provide some thoughts please
‎[09/09/2024, 14:44:54] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[09/09/2024, 14:45:13] Peter Empson: The benchmark is John Lewis
[09/09/2024, 14:46:47] Sam Amdjadi: they are currently matching angle poise own website who have an offer of £92. This will revert to £103. Regardless, we can compete with John Lewis and get to £90 if required. Cash margin would be around £30 on that price. So it will be interesting to estimate the cost per conversion
[09/09/2024, 14:47:29] Sam Amdjadi: John Lewis have much improved their product detail pages, but I think @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩ can do better her also
[09/09/2024, 15:14:58] Peter Empson: I’m afraid it’s not straightforward to estimate a CPA if there is no data to go on. The CPA would be dependent on the conversion rate which in the case of the products you have on at the moment is just under 4%.. If a 4% conversion rate could be achieved on Anglepoise then the CPA would be £6.17 but there are a lot of ifs, buts and maybes in there not least that we would need to get exposure on the ads which is not a quick thing to do because of the way that Google takes time to assess the products and ads
[09/09/2024, 15:35:58] Sam Amdjadi: I think around that could work. i suppose the only way is to try and then review
[09/09/2024, 15:36:08] Sam Amdjadi: I’ll advance discussion with Anglepoise
[09/09/2024, 15:36:35] Peter Empson: Ye sthat would be the only way we could know for sure but it depends how much its going to cost you to find out
[09/09/2024, 15:52:54] Sam Amdjadi: lets see what we can agree in terms of initial stock purchase
[15/09/2024, 12:59:39] Sam Amdjadi: @⁨Peter Empson⁩ might be good to just turn on all ads so we can see how the next week goes. Keen to get sales up so we can see how Fellow will do and what kind of stocks we need to order
[15/09/2024, 13:23:22] Peter Empson: Ok.
[15/09/2024, 20:46:50] Peter Empson: All ads are re-activated but the budget will need increasing from £20/day. I would suggest at least £35
[15/09/2024, 21:42:15] Sam Amdjadi: Let’s try it and see what happens
[15/09/2024, 22:00:11] Peter Empson: Done, budget is £35/day - please don’t expect miracles straight awayit needs to get momentm going again
‎[17/09/2024, 13:13:24] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[19/09/2024, 11:08:05] Peter Empson: Do you have an EAN numbers for the Fellow Carter Wide Mugs?
[19/09/2024, 11:11:17] Zoe Godshot: I’ll check the packaging this afternoon
[19/09/2024, 11:14:57] Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe
[20/09/2024, 14:59:23] Zoe Godshot: Hi Peter, I checked our stock and we are still selling through the Carter Everywhere mugs at the moment, so we don’t actually have any Carter Wide Mugs to hand. Not sure if both products share the same codes, but I think the only difference between them is the name. Here are the barcodes from the packaging—

Stone blue: 84022802471
Matte grey: 852212007847
Matte white: 852212007823
Matte black: 852212007809
Cargo green OOS
[23/09/2024, 17:19:09] Peter Empson: Sales up 42% on last month already with a spend of £405 which is a ROAS of 700%.
Just wanted to check in with you both that this is OK and not putting to much of a strain on operations and stock ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2024, 09:21:44] Sam Amdjadi: yeah we’ve been keeping a close eye on this - thanks for checking in. Operationally Zoe is hit but we’re making it work. Unfortunately we had an issue in store with a young (malicious) member of staff and this reached havoc - the remanence of which we’re dealing with (including helping in store). 

But the good news we’re meeting a couple of people later today to help with pick/pack and stock receiving/inventory checks. 

We’ve been able to react to stock requirements and are reasonably well positioned on that front for further growth. ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2024, 09:35:58] Peter Empson: Thanks Sam, sorry to hear that. As the account re-establishes itself the volume of traffic available to us will increase, already there is potential to spend another £10 per day and still achieve the same ROAS target. Let me know when you are ready to expand a bit more.
[24/09/2024, 09:38:15] Peter Empson: It would help if you had some EANs for the Lochby journal, it is flying but it is limited in its reach by not having an EAN
[24/09/2024, 12:11:24] Zoe Godshot: Where are these added to the website? I’ve added to Lightspeed but not sure it translates
[24/09/2024, 13:45:49] Peter Empson: Hi Zoe, I’m afraid I don’t know - Sam’s your man
[24/09/2024, 13:55:50] Zoe Godshot: So how do they assist ads? Is there somewhere else that EANs are inputted?
[24/09/2024, 14:04:57] Peter Empson: Somehow Sam has inputted them into the Woocommerce cataogue so that when I extract the data I can put them into Google Merchant Centre. GMC is where the info for the ads is taken from , having the EAN number makes for more comlete data and enables the ads to show in more places
[24/09/2024, 14:12:52] Zoe Godshot: Ah ok I see. Could you give me an example of a product that has an EAN so I can find where it’s been entered on lightspeed/ woocommerce?
[24/09/2024, 14:13:49] Peter Empson: Most of the Fellows products have them, try https://mygodshot.com/product/fellow-opus-conical-burr-grinder/?attribute_pa_fellow-colour=matte-black 
I have this as product id 17785 ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2024, 14:14:12] Peter Empson: EAN is 840228803997
[24/09/2024, 14:16:47] Zoe Godshot: I’ve just had a quick look and it’s nowhere immediately obvious… @⁨Sam Amdjadi⁩?
[26/09/2024, 11:21:53] Peter Empson: The account is currently being constrained by the budget which is set at £35/day. There is potential to hit the current target ROAS of 700% with a higher daily budget which would result in higher sales volume. In April the budget was £80/day and the target ROAS was being hit.
The suggested budget is £65/day, are you ready for this sort of increase in sales?
[27/09/2024, 11:41:41] Sam Amdjadi: I guess theres only one way to find out - lets do it and see what happens 🤞
[02/10/2024, 09:28:15] Sam Amdjadi: ads were paused I believe due to a payment issue. I had to update card details due to an issue with old card. Please keep an eye on ads today
[02/10/2024, 09:48:50] Peter Empson: …every day 😀 Thanks for the heads-up
[11/10/2024, 10:51:11] Peter Empson: After a month of to-ing and fro-ing between the hosting company and Channable I have had to take the decision to replace Channable with another data feed management system which I have just implemented. It wasn’t the easiest of implementations and despite my best endeavours there are a few discrepancies in the feed but they are minor and not in fields that have a huge influence on visibility. I’m not expecting any changes to performance but you can never guarantee how Google will react to changes.
I have also been working on optimising the product titles so that they get the best exposure for the products. This process is an ongoing one and I’m prioritising the best sellers first
[11/10/2024, 11:01:17] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks for the update. Zoe and I had been chatting about how we can make improvements here also. We’ve noticed Fellow isn’t performing as it previously was - do you have any info on this. In other news, we’ve brought Anglepoise on and will be working on adding them in, as well as another exciting brand
‎[11/10/2024, 11:02:40] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[11/10/2024, 11:05:42] Peter Empson: Its interesting how many other brands are working as well now - Dak, Rains, 19-69, Kinto - better not to have all your eggs in one basket
[11/10/2024, 11:07:06] Peter Empson: At the risk of sounding like a stuck record I could do with more GTINS if possible - Rains, 19-69 and KInto for starters
[25/10/2024, 12:05:20] Peter Empson: Is it possible to match the prices for Fellow?
[25/10/2024, 12:08:04] Sam Amdjadi: Hey Peter, a little update from our side:

- we’ve been stretched to the limit the past month working 7 days to support the physical space (staff issues) 
- ⁠we’ve purchased new shelving to optimise the storage space for e-commerce 
- ⁠I’m training someone to support Zoe so she can put more time to product addition and supporting you
[25/10/2024, 12:09:15] Sam Amdjadi: on top of all of those, stupid things have decimated our time and mental energy: blocked drain at shop and other fixes.
[25/10/2024, 12:09:16] Peter Empson: Awesome, that’s all positive but not great about being so stretched
[25/10/2024, 12:10:02] Peter Empson: I’ll stick to the digital world although that does produce its own challenges!
[25/10/2024, 12:14:44] Sam Amdjadi: We have days when we just want to stop. Its been exhausting of late and getting covid in the midst of it didnt help. But like you say, we all have issues of sorts and have to find a way to navigate them whilst staying sane
[25/10/2024, 12:16:07] Peter Empson: You’re building something great Sam
[25/10/2024, 12:17:34] Sam Amdjadi: maybe we’ll have to eventually shut down the physical store that is draining so much of our time and focus online only
[25/10/2024, 12:18:03] Peter Empson: Could it support a full time manager?
[25/10/2024, 12:19:23] Sam Amdjadi: Finding people that care is very difficult here but its certainly something we have to consider. The store is struggling with the existing manager
[25/10/2024, 12:19:27] Sam Amdjadi: (lesley) n
[25/10/2024, 12:20:19] Peter Empson: I must admit its why I’ve never grown the business
[25/10/2024, 12:21:39] Sam Amdjadi: if you can keep it staff free, I would. In any business I’ve owned, staff are the number one problem (and opportunity). Most independent businesses in Glasgow now try to operate a model to avoid recruitment. e.g. open only 3 days etc
[25/10/2024, 12:25:14] Zoe Godshot: I’ve put Opus at £175 from £185, reviewed Stagg also but seems to be competitive at £150 with free delivery.
Are there other lines we should reduce?
[25/10/2024, 12:27:49] Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe
[25/10/2024, 12:28:20] Peter Empson: The sales on all of Fellow have dropped dramatically, it might be worth revieweing the top sellers and comparing online
[28/10/2024, 16:24:28] Sam Amdjadi: Anglepoise: we’ve now got these in stock. They are the best sellers and we can match Amazon 

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anglepoise-Anodised-Brushed-Aluminium-Finish/dp/B07MWSGF6F?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A3Q9DMXZ46SDD0
[28/10/2024, 17:50:08] Peter Empson: Great, I’ll take a look
‎[29/10/2024, 16:02:36] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[29/10/2024, 16:03:39] Sam Amdjadi: Let me know what price we need to be at and if anything else needed form our side

[29/10/2024, 17:25:00] Sam Amdjadi: In theory we could try £214.99, free delivery and next day
[29/10/2024, 17:25:16] Peter Empson: It seems to be setting a bar on price along with Lamp Twist
[29/10/2024, 17:25:54] Sam Amdjadi: I belive they are grey import
[29/10/2024, 17:26:19] Sam Amdjadi: We can emphasise our credentials as uk and authorise partner
[29/10/2024, 17:26:47] Peter Empson: We can’t do that in the shopping ad tho’
[29/10/2024, 17:27:07] Peter Empson: We can try the £214.99 as it undercuts John Lewis
[29/10/2024, 17:27:26] Sam Amdjadi: There is no doubt that customer will initially click them but see quite quickly it’s a 6 week lead time
[29/10/2024, 17:27:53] Peter Empson: The only way is to test it and see what we get
[29/10/2024, 17:28:03] Peter Empson: Rarthet go in too high than too low
[29/10/2024, 17:28:11] Peter Empson: Preserve the margin
[29/10/2024, 17:28:52] Sam Amdjadi: I think 214 is a competitive start. We can always bring down a bit of required
[29/10/2024, 17:29:39] Peter Empson: OK
[29/10/2024, 17:30:19] Peter Empson: I could put these in a separate campaign to start with so that we can get some traction but it would be at a lower target ROAS
[29/10/2024, 17:39:40] Sam Amdjadi: Sounds good. Zoe will recheck the product pages tonight also
[29/10/2024, 22:02:16] Peter Empson: Having the GTINs for the Anglepoise lamps would really help with it being so competitive
[29/10/2024, 22:15:21] Sam Amdjadi: Zoe has updated pricing and stock. Will forward gtins tomorrow whne have packaging in front of me
[29/10/2024, 23:03:45] Sam Amdjadi: It would be great to get to the bottom of fellow sales. We’re fairly overstocked (big investment) and I’m always worried with such products that it can very easily become out of date if they release something new
[29/10/2024, 23:04:08] Sam Amdjadi: we have completely stopped amazon sales (by from from fellow)
‎[30/10/2024, 01:02:09] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[30/10/2024, 07:25:59] Peter Empson: Free delivery was set so that it wa soirders over£100 so I have changed that to £99.99
[30/10/2024, 08:28:42] Peter Empson: With the Fellow products there are now a lot more competitors in the market lace who are offering free delivery and who maybe have lower ROAS targets than we do
[30/10/2024, 08:47:21] Peter Empson: There are quite a few Fellow products that do not have ‘Fellow’ set as the brand name. I use the brand name to group products together so if it isn’t set then the product will not be contained in the grouping e.g. 19558, 19551

[31/10/2024, 10:17:46] Peter Empson: What in particular Sam The review stars? ‎<This message was edited>
[31/10/2024, 10:19:27] Sam Amdjadi: yeah
[31/10/2024, 10:20:38] Peter Empson: Shop ratings show with Search Network campaigns and they'll only serve in a country when one of the following criteria is met:

Google has received or collected enough unique reviews for the country within the last 24 months across Google Customer Reviews or our third-party review partners to confidently calculate a shop rating. The number of reviews needed can vary from business to business, but most merchants are able to obtain a rating after collecting 100 or more eligible reviews.
Google or its partners have completed a research evaluation of your site.
Additionally, both of the following criteria must be met:

Average, composite, rating of 3.5 or more stars for text ads
Unpaid listings can show shop ratings if the average rating is less than 3.5 stars
The ad’s visible URL domain must match the domain for which we have the ratings
[31/10/2024, 10:20:53] Peter Empson: Are you collecting product reviews via Trustpilot?
[31/10/2024, 10:21:38] Sam Amdjadi: Not sure about product, but Zoe has been working on these

https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.mygodshot.com
[31/10/2024, 10:21:39] Peter Empson: If you are then they will automatically be sending them to Google, when the threshold and criteria are met then Google may(or may not) show the reviews
[31/10/2024, 10:22:00] Peter Empson: The stars in the ads are product reviews
[31/10/2024, 10:22:07] Peter Empson: and relate to that product
[31/10/2024, 10:23:26] Peter Empson: If you are collecting product reviews/ratings then sooner or later I would suggest showing them on the relevant product pages
[31/10/2024, 10:29:52] Sam Amdjadi: *Stutterheim* A brand i’ve worked to bring on board and we have access to keen pricing. 

Is there something to be done online? This is their most popular product 

https://stutterheim.com/en-gb/men/best-sellers/stockholm-lightweight-light-sand
[31/10/2024, 10:30:12] Sam Amdjadi: We could sell for £150ish
‎[31/10/2024, 10:32:55] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
‎[31/10/2024, 10:33:10] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 10:33:58] Sam Amdjadi: unfortunately thats the nature of these things - there are always cons. If you dig deeper, you’ll see that those prices relate to random sizes and one off’s
[31/10/2024, 10:34:37] Peter Empson: I find that you don’t know until you put the product up there. It would all depend on how aggressive the competition are with their bidding.

You’ve got to be careful that you don’t end up trying to be the Amazon of the higher end product world asyou could spread yourself too thinly
[31/10/2024, 10:36:23] Sam Amdjadi: My experience is trying to find a couple of products within a brand that are going under the radar, so to say. A bag, an accessory etc. Use that as the means to generate sales and gradually build the brand (in store / online)
[31/10/2024, 10:44:40] Zoe Godshot: It started because at some point I found I could upload swatches instead of have a drop down menu to select product variant and so implemented it brand by brand, creating a new attribute each time. In theory I could put them all under 1 attribute, but would there still be the same issue if I’m trying to distinguish colours that are the same by name but have different images? ie there may be 15 different variants called ‘red’ distinguished by different slugs

[31/10/2024, 10:49:42] Zoe Godshot: Yeah
‎[31/10/2024, 10:50:11] Zoe Godshot: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 10:50:20] Peter Empson: Mmmm I can see why you’ve done it
[31/10/2024, 10:50:55] Zoe Godshot: There is an argument for simplifying it though. We can’t allow customers to filter products by colour at the moment
[31/10/2024, 10:50:58] Peter Empson: Is there any way when you set the attribute you could also populate the ‘colour’ attribute at the same time?
[31/10/2024, 10:51:33] Peter Empson: You could use the brand colour for the swatches and the generic colour to filter
[31/10/2024, 10:51:48] Peter Empson: The swatches do look good
[31/10/2024, 11:07:00] Zoe Godshot: For the Google ads, is it as simple as creating the colours as variants under the main ‘colour’ attribute? Or does it need to be linked to the product in some way?
Ive added ‘Alessi Test Product’ to the site to play with. It’s got the Alessi colour attribute visible to customers, but also assigned the main ‘colour’ attribute hidden from customer view
[31/10/2024, 11:07:32] Peter Empson: I’ll take a look
[31/10/2024, 11:10:19] Peter Empson: color or colour?
[31/10/2024, 11:10:27] Peter Empson: There are 2 attributes
‎[31/10/2024, 11:11:11] Zoe Godshot: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 11:13:56] Peter Empson: The proper spelling!
[31/10/2024, 11:15:07] Zoe Godshot: I believe ‘color’ was added by Lesley, certainly not me 😅
[31/10/2024, 11:15:47] Peter Empson: You’re off the hook!
‎[31/10/2024, 11:43:58] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 11:44:17] Peter Empson: That s for product id 21514
[31/10/2024, 11:45:06] Peter Empson: There is also a product under 21515 which also has this colour
[31/10/2024, 11:45:34] Peter Empson: Its as though ithe colour has been set for the parent rather than the variants

[31/10/2024, 22:05:40] Peter Empson: OK
[06/11/2024, 08:33:23] Peter Empson: I could do with some EAN numbers for the Anglepoise range, these are very competitive so the more data we have in them the better. A spreadsheet with the 2 columns  - item id and EAN - would be more than enough
[08/11/2024, 14:20:23] Sam Amdjadi: We’ll get those to you today. I noticed a chrome 1227 mini sold!
[08/11/2024, 14:20:56] Sam Amdjadi: atm our sales seem mostly dependant on kinto and fellow. It would be good to get another heavy hitting brand onboard
[11/11/2024, 16:26:24] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, sorry for the delayed response I had an early finish on Friday. I'd set up an individual campaign for the anglepoise lamps, and that seems to be doing the trick (ROAS is over 400%). I'm actually quite surprised how quickly the campaign has taken off. Once we get a bit more traction, I'll put that into the standard P Max campaign.

[15/11/2024, 12:00:09] Peter Empson: Hi Zoe, sorry for the delay in getting back to you about the GTIN numbers, I have been trying all sorts to try and pull them into the feed but I’m having no luck. I’ve raised a ticket with the product feed providers who can hopefully help me find the data
[19/11/2024, 18:01:42] Peter Empson: Found It !!!!!

[20/11/2024, 10:16:36] Peter Empson: So that is your business profile, it wont affect what I’m doing in Google Ads. Thanks for letting me know
[20/11/2024, 11:59:31] Sam Amdjadi: so two more things to share with you: 

1. Our instagram account of 4 years with 12,000 followers was somehow hacked over the weekend and we were held to ransom. We have no access and trying to contact meta. Its been traumatic and a completely nightmare. I contemplated just stopping everything as it so depressing after thousands of hours of work. 
2. ⁠We’ve got a sale event tonight at 7pm. Email will go out to newsletter subscribers. Not a profit maker but hoping to generate 10k sales to get rid of slow selling items.
[20/11/2024, 12:00:04] Peter Empson: Oh no!!!
[20/11/2024, 12:00:41] Peter Empson: I wish I could help you with that but its something I’ve not come across before
[20/11/2024, 12:01:02] Peter Empson: You’ve gone too far to stop now Sam!
[20/11/2024, 12:01:04] Sam Amdjadi: Its honestly so demoralising. I’ve managed to meta verify my personal account and speak to instagram
[20/11/2024, 12:01:27] Peter Empson: Fingers crossed for you
[20/11/2024, 12:49:45] Sam Amdjadi: thanks - I previously lost an account with 40k followers. Seems lighting does strike twice. I’m just perplexed how they accessed an account with 2 step verification..
[20/11/2024, 12:51:27] Sam Amdjadi: In other news, had a long discussion with WP Engine. They are going ot move us to a dedicated server with significantly improved service and performance
[20/11/2024, 12:51:44] Sam Amdjadi: migration taking place just now and should complete by 5pm
[20/11/2024, 14:05:48] Peter Empson: Thats good news
[20/11/2024, 14:06:30] Peter Empson: There are a lot of unnecessary plugins on Wordpress that could do wioth being removed, they will be slowing things down
[20/11/2024, 14:06:52] Sam Amdjadi: yeah I did a first fix recently. Planning on a second flush soon
[21/11/2024, 10:34:31] Peter Empson: What just happened?
[21/11/2024, 10:35:36] Peter Empson: That was some Sale!
[21/11/2024, 10:48:55] Sam Amdjadi: We’re now dealing with the aftermath. We were here till early hours. Big job now to manage/communicate/dispatch/arrange pick up etc.
[21/11/2024, 10:49:05] Sam Amdjadi: ultimately its not a money maker - we just wanted to clear out older stocks
[21/11/2024, 10:49:24] Sam Amdjadi: So overall a net loss but better to generate some cash to pay suppliers!]
[21/11/2024, 10:49:51] Peter Empson: and it gives the bid strategy some great data
[21/11/2024, 10:50:37] Sam Amdjadi: Such a shame our instagram is in limbo - it was a very warm audience and things would have gone even better last night
[21/11/2024, 10:51:34] Peter Empson: How much sale stock is left?
[21/11/2024, 10:51:53] Peter Empson: It goes to show how price sensitive the market is
[21/11/2024, 10:52:14] Peter Empson: better to do it the week before Black Friday when the clicks will be a lot more expensive
[21/11/2024, 10:53:41] Peter Empson: There is more capacity with the budget, its currently on £79 but could go to £130 but I would suspect you don’y t need any more traffic!
[21/11/2024, 10:54:19] Peter Empson: 29X ROAS yesterday
[21/11/2024, 11:03:46] Sam Amdjadi: our website now has more scale in theory in terms of bandwidth
[21/11/2024, 11:04:01] Sam Amdjadi: We’ve still some stocks left, but feeling a lot better than this time yesterday
[21/11/2024, 11:04:06] Sam Amdjadi: cash was getting very tight indeed
[21/11/2024, 11:04:17] Peter Empson: Do you want me to increase?
[21/11/2024, 11:04:54] Peter Empson: The pricing data will be invaluable for you going forward
[21/11/2024, 11:06:35] Sam Amdjadi: go ahead

[02/12/2024, 22:22:19] Peter Empson: Not sure what to suggest here, its a dev thing that I am not familiar with
[03/12/2024, 19:16:34] Peter Empson: Google are suggesting there is capacity to increase the budget by £300 a day (?!!??!!) I wouldn’t suggest going that far but it could be lifted by £100 per day if you have the stock, manpower and inclination
[18/12/2024, 10:48:11] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, so we’ve reached cut off now for delivery in so far as we’ll not really be able to get orders out for xmas. What is the best way to deal with google to avoid wasting ad spend
[18/12/2024, 10:48:35] Peter Empson: I will make the necessary adjustments
[20/12/2024, 10:26:59] Sam Amdjadi: no orders will now leave until well after xmas. Zoe will need a break from incessant packing until at least mid jan. so probably best to minimise ad spend to an absolute minimum
[20/12/2024, 10:40:24] Peter Empson: OK
[23/12/2024, 17:46:14] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, please pause all ads if not already done so - thanks. Have a lovely Christmas
[23/12/2024, 17:49:32] Peter Empson: Hi Sam
[23/12/2024, 17:50:56] Peter Empson: I have pulled the spend back dramatically since the 18th, its around £30/day now. I would rather keep the ads just ticking over rather than pausing them as the latter could affect them detrimentally when they go back on again. I can take it to £10/day?
[29/12/2024, 14:52:26] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, I’m looking to make plans for 2025 and naturally online represents the biggest growth for us. We did very well in Nov/Dec in terms of sales. Margin was hit hard as we targeted best pricing across big brands reducing prices by 30%+. But thats not necessarily an unmanageable situation. Operationally we were stretched also. The aim is now to take what we’ve learnt and move into 2025 with intentionality, starting with a headline plan: 

- annual turnover 
- ⁠annual marketing spend 
- ⁠return on spend 
- ⁠avg basket / daily sales 

I can then use this information to flesh out some kind of plan and ensure we are working in unison. It’d be good to have your thoughts around what happened and what could be
[30/12/2024, 11:16:13] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, we haven’t actually learnt enough from the sale in November and December to make a forecast. The sales during this period were off the back off high conversion rates brought about by sales prices and a seasonal increase. During the rest of the year these factors will not be in play and will affect the conversion rates that are achievable. 
In addition to this the campaigns were also limited by budget so I cannot tell what ROAS the campaigns would have been able to get given an elevated budget.
[30/12/2024, 11:52:40] Sam Amdjadi: I see - based on what we know so far, can we estimate some annual forecasts/targets? A lot of the operational, procurement rests on an element of planning. 

Our inc VAT turnover this year seems to be c.£270k but that of course includes non trading period of June > Aug and a stop/start approach. What investment from a marketing perspective is needed to get turnover to £1mill in 2025? I can then plan other elements of the business
[30/12/2024, 11:59:30] Peter Empson: I want to assist as much as I can Sam but thats a bit beyond my pay grade, this is full on business forecasting that will need to take a lot more into consideration than just the spend on Google. The campaigns are very much beholden to the products that the business has to offer and will flex dependent on the ROAS targets that are set. The spend in November/December was unprecedented due to the product offering and the seasonality, the site is unproven without those 2 factors and you will have new products being introduced next year that could affect those numbers dramatically.
In November we saw the numbers increase massively as the prices dropped and the budget was for a period of time untethered ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/2024, 12:02:08] Peter Empson: The budget at the moment on the account is £10 which brought is ROAS of 2500% yesterday but as that budget is increased the ROAS will fall as the campaigns start to advertise in more competitive areas. For the whole of December the ROAS was 1257% but that is not something that can be maintained the whole year and at this stage we don’t have a full year’s figures to look at to see what the seasonal variations will be. ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/2024, 12:08:37] Peter Empson: Revenue from Google this year was £155K with a ROAS of 947% on a budget of £16K but that was with no ads running from the end of May to September so that is 8 months. Given a full year with no budgetary restrictions to achieve a Google Ads turnover of £1m on a ROAS of, say, 700% would require a spend of £142K but that is a real back of a fag packet figure that has a lot of ifs, buts and maybes:-
Product offering
Product Pricing
Google Ads competition
Google Ads changes
plus other things
[30/12/2024, 12:09:37] Sam Amdjadi: could you send me details of the dashboard please so I can see our performance matrix. We have to base forecast based on something - even if it is a best guess - and thus determine budgets and best use of resources. Whilst we want to maintain a nimbleness and reactivity in this fledgeling business, it’s hard to attain growth if the targets are unclear.
[30/12/2024, 12:10:15] Peter Empson: Which dashboard, the Google Ads one?
[30/12/2024, 12:11:58] Sam Amdjadi: What we learnt: 

- Fellow is price driven but there is big opportunity online
- ⁠Kinto has a small basket size but highly popular 
- ⁠Fragrance sells better than expected although there is a large seasonality to it 
- ⁠Coffee beans is largely untapped and unknown 

Overall the winning formula appears the same: a few heavy hitting / high price ticket brands, complemented with variety to pull people back to spend.
[30/12/2024, 12:12:24] Sam Amdjadi: yeah your dashboard
[30/12/2024, 12:13:28] Peter Empson: You had a dashboard at the beginning of our engagement that I built using a software tool. This was removed when we had a break in summer so I will need to set that up again
[30/12/2024, 12:13:42] Sam Amdjadi: We’ve also not explored other areas. For example I am working on a white label matcha powder offering. We have excellent local reputation in this regard (and were mentioned in guardian also). Could this be an evergreen product for us (pardon the pun)
[30/12/2024, 12:14:23] Sam Amdjadi: could we set up a coffee subscription for Dak - they seem hugely popular and again no one really competing in uk
[30/12/2024, 12:14:46] Peter Empson: What i do with the ads is react to those business decisions you make on the ecommerce platform, I can’t make sales out of a bad product or one that is too expensive
[30/12/2024, 12:15:56] Sam Amdjadi: I suppose if our price is out, then people don’t visit the site in the first instance?
[30/12/2024, 12:16:42] Peter Empson: They may do but over time th ads will show less and less because the conversion rate would be poor and the campaign would not be hitting its ROAS target
[30/12/2024, 12:20:46] Sam Amdjadi: Forecasts should be based on our current pricing and product range in any event. I’ll have a look at our chat more carefully and it would be great to have some real insight into the past couple of months or if you’re able to set up that dashboard, then I can analyse from there. I’d like to understand the potential for next year. If I am to determine the marketing plan for 2025, then I need to understand more deeply how our marketing is operating at a fairly macro level, and align our product strategy more closely.
[30/12/2024, 12:21:59] Peter Empson: The dashboard is being built as we speak, it just takes a little time for it to pull all the data in  I’ll let you know when its done and give you your login details
[30/12/2024, 12:23:21] Peter Empson: The sooner we can increase the spend the better, we’ve gathered a lot of data over the last 2 months I don’t want it to just slip away
[30/12/2024, 12:24:02] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll let @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩ comment on that as operationally I know she is a little spent from the past month and we’re trying to train up someone new
[05/01/2025, 12:44:28] Peter Empson: Hi @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩, what are your thoughts on increasing the budget ever so slightly? The main shopping campaign has a daily budget of £5 and the recommended is £20. The £5 budget brought in 5 conversions yesterday so if it went to £20 then it would mean 12 orders a day.
I’m concerned that all the sales that were generated and shipped over the Christmas are not going to be used as effective traffic by Google unless we turn the dial up a bit
[05/01/2025, 12:47:28] Zoe Godshot: Hi Peter, let’s increase to £20 - thanks
[05/01/2025, 12:48:02] Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe, I hope you’ve had a relaxing break, it went crazy!
[05/01/2025, 13:05:42] Zoe Godshot: Yeah, it was a tough couple of weeks but a good learning curve. We’ll be better prepared next time 😄
[06/01/2025, 15:32:39] Peter Empson: The increase certainly did the trick! The sales look like they were boosted by the increase in budget, the ROAS was very good. Needless to say Google have calculated that there is potential to lift the budget from £20 to £70 if you wanted to
[06/01/2025, 15:33:35] Sam Amdjadi: Perhaps we should try it and see how it goes. I’ll also need to review the inventory positions
[06/01/2025, 15:34:42] Peter Empson: Agreed, we are always in control of the budget and it looks like you have hit a sweet spot with the product offering
[06/01/2025, 15:36:03] Sam Amdjadi: We’ve also just taken delivery of these - potentially a very in demand product and we have great pricing on it, if not the best online

[06/01/2025, 15:36:08] Peter Empson: I have no doubt I;’ll be coming back to you ahgain cap in hand by the end of the week
[06/01/2025, 15:36:23] Peter Empson: I’ve literally just been looking at those
[06/01/2025, 15:36:29] Peter Empson: One sold on Google Ads already
[06/01/2025, 15:36:58] Sam Amdjadi: its clear that fellow and kinto are big hitters for us. Perhaps we could consider trying to dominate both these brands. They should by themselves hit our daily targets
[06/01/2025, 15:37:45] Peter Empson: It has been that way pretty much from the start, along with Rains
[06/01/2025, 15:37:53] Sam Amdjadi: dak coffee is another. Big speciality coffee brand which is underrepresented online and businesses dont know how to manage the coffee buying / selling cycle like we do
[06/01/2025, 15:38:03] Sam Amdjadi: We’re replacing rains with Stutterheim
[06/01/2025, 15:39:46] Peter Empson: All good news Sam, its going to be important to keep ahead of the curve with these brands and try to aim for as much exclusivity as you can
[06/01/2025, 15:40:34] Sam Amdjadi: Exclusivity will be a challenge, but we can be competitive. Our website is also well presented and trust worthy, particularly as we have a physical store.
[06/01/2025, 15:41:50] Peter Empson: Love the new Fellow coffee machine but love my Chemex more!
[06/01/2025, 15:42:18] Sam Amdjadi: you’d pay cost price Peter if you wanted one.. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/01/2025, 15:43:17] Peter Empson: Appreciate that Sam, you tempted me enough to get the Timemore scales, its the Fellow burr grinder next but I’ll have to wait for my birthday! ‎<This message was edited>
[06/01/2025, 15:45:20] Sam Amdjadi: The ode will be a game changer - I recommend spending big on grinder
[06/01/2025, 15:45:52] Peter Empson: I thought you might 😂
[06/01/2025, 15:46:12] Sam Amdjadi: 🤑
[06/01/2025, 15:46:32] Sam Amdjadi: seriously though, after beans, 80% of the game is the grinder
[06/01/2025, 15:47:04] Peter Empson: Thats interesting, I do love the whole theatre of making a pour over
[06/01/2025, 15:47:37] Peter Empson: The De Longhi grinder I have is a bit ‘haphazard’
‎[06/01/2025, 15:49:28] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[06/01/2025, 15:51:01] Sam Amdjadi: You should come up some time and stay at our house for a few days. It would be good for you to see the set up, meet us and we can also talk coffee. We use the weber eg-1 with ulf burrs for filter at the store
[06/01/2025, 15:52:32] Peter Empson: I’m sure my wife and I are due a camping trip to Scotland some time this year, would love to come in and see how its done properly
[06/01/2025, 15:52:54] Peter Empson: That Weber is insane!
[06/01/2025, 15:53:43] Peter Empson: I find it incredible it makes such a difference to warrant that price
[06/01/2025, 15:54:35] Sam Amdjadi: The quality of the weber is unmatched. You can simply see it in the grounds it produces even before tasting
[06/01/2025, 15:54:43] Sam Amdjadi: its also a stunning piece of engineering

[06/01/2025, 15:56:36] Sam Amdjadi: coffee friend are also quoting 2 weeks delivery time. I believe people will choose us
[06/01/2025, 15:57:11] Sam Amdjadi: Its mostly magnetic so its easy
[06/01/2025, 15:59:04] Peter Empson: I think I’ll pull the Aiden into a single product campaign to see if I can increase its exposure
[06/01/2025, 15:59:39] Sam Amdjadi: That sounds like a good idea. I wonder if most of fellow would benefit from this
[06/01/2025, 16:02:15] Peter Empson: The other Feloow products are already up and running so they are doing OK. This product is new and is in a campaign with a target ROAS of 800% but it is bringing in well over 1000%. I will set the target to 600% knowing I’ll get at least 800% then I’ll put it back in the main campaign. It’s never a good thing to split the campaigns down too much as it reduces the stats the campaign has to work on.
[06/01/2025, 16:08:20] Peter Empson: Could do with an EAN number on the Fellow Aiden
‎[06/01/2025, 16:10:33] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[07/01/2025, 08:49:21] Peter Empson: Huge ramp up in sales yesterday and a 2000% ROAS on Google Ads. There is potential to now take the budget to £210/day and whilst I wouldn’t expect that the ROAS would stay at 2000% I would expect that we would get at least 800%. 
I appreciate that this is now a logistics/stock decision
[07/01/2025, 10:08:04] Sam Amdjadi: Yeah I noticed also. Let me check with Zoe and see if we can manage it. The biggest issue we have atm is finding someone suitable to work part/full time
[09/01/2025, 09:39:04] Sam Amdjadi: I think we’ll be readier in about a week for a potential increase. Our plan for January is: 

- recruitment 
- ⁠stock take / analysis 
- ⁠replenishment 
- ⁠process review 
- ⁠dpd onboard 

The idea is to improve infrastructure and try to push on this year
[09/01/2025, 09:56:09] Peter Empson: Makes sense and by the end of Jan things w
[09/01/2025, 09:57:02] Peter Empson: Will be on a more even keel

[16/01/2025, 15:19:02] Sam Amdjadi: just to share here also, we’ve appointed a full time member of staff to work on pick/pack and other related duties starting on the 11th Feb. Thats the first part of preparing for scale. Other plans include onboarding DPD in the next week, improving the space etc ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2025, 15:20:18] Peter Empson: Great! Thanks for letting me know
[16/01/2025, 15:20:47] Sam Amdjadi: We’re also working to expand our international reach with DPD / fedex accounts
[16/01/2025, 15:21:28] Peter Empson: It’s a tough old business shipping abroad, fraught with paperwork
[16/01/2025, 15:21:44] Sam Amdjadi: we’re getting better at it
[04/02/2025, 21:22:44] Peter Empson: Are you guys ready to turn the wick up slightly? The main campaign is £80 day with a potential for £210/day. Could I do another £30/day?
[04/02/2025, 21:58:58] Sam Amdjadi: natalia has joined the team and is starting next week. We think she will take a week to get to a reasonable standard - she’s already spent a bit of time with us. we’re also onboarding dpd next week. So i think in about 2 weeks will be a good time for us to catch up properly around budgets, campaigns and any activities we can undertake to increase sales. 

We came to the conclusion that increasing web sales to 500k this year would represent a positive step as long as margins were eroded too much. So thats the target for 2025
[06/02/2025, 08:33:45] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, total Gross sales were £35K in January with a Google Ads spend of £2,319. If we were to roll that out evenly over 12 months that would give a gross revenue of £420K without increasing the Google Ads budget. Doubling the Google Ads spend may not give exactly the same rate of return but it should still be acceptable and I would expect we could easily hit £500K. There was a sale in January, there will be seasonal peaks and troughs, it is dependent upon product and competition but I still think it is eminently  achievable.
[06/02/2025, 13:37:37] Sam Amdjadi: yeah i think its acheivable, not least because we are onboarding new brands, will make better use of our growing database and reputation, and there is always organic increase. That said, i expect road blocks too - brands pulling out or changing supply chain, growth pains and so on
[11/02/2025, 00:10:16] Sam Amdjadi: Hi peter, we are unmatched on our new prices on this brand which has good traction online. Might be worth its own campaigns

https://mygodshot.com/19-69/
[11/02/2025, 06:52:57] Peter Empson: Thanks Sam I’ll take a look
[11/02/2025, 13:06:28] Sam Amdjadi: the goal has to be to be number 1 for fragrances online in the UK. it ticks all the boxes for us: small item, good value, decent repeat, buy for self/gift, reasonable margin. What do you think - can you set in motion the actions to dominate this category @⁨Peter Empson⁩ ?
[11/02/2025, 13:09:09] Peter Empson: Hi Sam I understand that you want to dominate the category but be aware that there are bigger companies out there with far deeper pockets. I would suggest that we want to be number 1 for people who want to buy the product you sell. The separate ad group has been set up to target the 19-69 products so the ball is rolling ‎<This message was edited>
[11/02/2025, 13:25:02] Sam Amdjadi: i guess there are all always two camps of browsers: 

1. know the product they want (yes we want to dominate that if it’s something we have)
2. ⁠know they want niche fragrance. don’t know which they want. open to suggestion.
[11/02/2025, 13:25:50] Peter Empson: Agreed but to be No 1 in such a competitive market place would be very very expensive
[11/02/2025, 13:26:13] Sam Amdjadi: (1.) will always be cheaper to fight for and more immediate results. (2.) is a slower burner and lower conveersion in theory, but i wonder if we have ‘clever’ campaigns, it might be cheaper to target these lukewarm customers
[11/02/2025, 13:27:03] Sam Amdjadi: wasting money to be number 1 is of course neither an option, or something i would ever condone. i’m looking to see if we can generate ideas between us to devise smart strategies: procurement, marketing
[11/02/2025, 13:27:56] Sam Amdjadi: we need to find out the broad terms people are using, and see if we can get in their heads much earlier in the buying cycle
[17/02/2025, 15:16:55] Sam Amdjadi: *Products hidden* we’ve noticed a few products hidden from search on the site. Wondered if something you may have tweaked at all?

e.g.

https://mygodshot.com/product/anglepoise-original-1227-desk-lamp/
[17/02/2025, 15:17:30] Sam Amdjadi: above not showing in search
[17/02/2025, 15:18:14] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve fixed it now
[24/02/2025, 16:34:26] Peter Empson: Hi Sam can I turn the wick up? ROAS for the month to date is 774% and spend is about a third of what it could be.
[26/02/2025, 11:19:11] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, ok lets do it and see what happens
[26/02/2025, 11:19:46] Sam Amdjadi: orders atm are quite low by comparison and the new girl is much more up to speed so we need orders to keep her busy 😅
[26/02/2025, 11:30:57] Peter Empson: Great, what are you comparing them with? I’m seeing a constant £1500/day in Woocommerce
[26/02/2025, 12:15:35] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll need to look at the figures more closely but i guess its a just a feeling in terms of the number of orders that are being packed. Zoe feels its quietened down the past two weeks
[26/02/2025, 12:22:10] Peter Empson: Half term has made a bit of a difference across all my clients but your ROAS is still strong
[26/02/2025, 14:45:00] Sam Amdjadi: at loggerheads with Fellow. They are moving to a uk distributor imminently - who will hike prices up. Which in turn means we become less competitive etc.
[26/02/2025, 14:45:44] Sam Amdjadi: can we afford to say bye bye to them? they are accounting for about 25% of online sales. Can we refocus attention elsewhere - e.g. coffee bean sales instead. Smaller, more regular, easier to store/ship
[26/02/2025, 14:46:29] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve agreed one last purchase of around 20k which will decimate our cash position, but i’m unsure whether worse proceeding with. thoughts?
[26/02/2025, 15:13:41] Peter Empson: What we focus on is what people search for and what we can supply at a competitive price, we can’t just steer people in a different direction. In the last 30 days Fellow did the following on Google Ads:-
Revenue - £6,382
Cost - £876.63
ROAS - 728%
So it is around 25% of the Google sales and would be a big blow if the brand went. If they change their distributor will it not affect everyone’s prices?
[26/02/2025, 15:15:07] Sam Amdjadi: we have to react and find opportunity elsewhere. We had a good ride with Fellow and this is the nature of selling other peoples products: they do whats best for them.
[26/02/2025, 15:15:45] Sam Amdjadi: Fellow had an amazon shop and they ultimately want to lift the market price and move as many customers to buy from them there. This is what acheives them the highest margin. Its what i would do if i were them
[26/02/2025, 15:16:33] Sam Amdjadi: as for moving people, well we wouldnt be moving, but finding another healthy market in which we are competitive and there is enough customers. There must be plenty but coffee really springs to mind
[26/02/2025, 15:17:39] Sam Amdjadi: a long terms project for me is to onboard Timemore. Another coffee brand that has a bit of a standing and there is a decent audience
[26/02/2025, 15:19:27] Sam Amdjadi: can we do some digging around on the coffee beans market opportunity. Must be huge so its about establishing whether we can take 0.1% of that at a good price
[26/02/2025, 15:20:55] Sam Amdjadi: Another porject i’m costing out is roasting our own coffee. So learning to sell coffee online in high voliume would be a good string to our bow
[26/02/2025, 15:21:36] Peter Empson: We have built a good history of sales with Google on the Fellow and that is a very valuable commodity as it makes it difficult for newcomers to enter that space. This history takes time to build up so I agree that being agile is a good thing it doesn’t sit well with Google as they like consistency.
Your sales come from displaying products that relate to searches people put into Google - it’s intent based and is not something we can force. If we can display products that trigger for that search that are desirable and at the right price then people will buy them.
[26/02/2025, 15:27:39] Sam Amdjadi: i think it will take 6 months for fellow to flush out the cheaper stock in the market and then move everyone to a higher playing field. i think we can still retain them, but we have to start thinking longer term. Having these big hitting brands is a poisoned chalice: on the one hand if you can get the price right, the orders are there. On the other hand if you become dependent on them, they can pull the rug from under your feet. I’ve seen it happen many times. An ideal scenrario is spreading the sales amongst many brands, and eventually have a few of your own products
[26/02/2025, 15:28:03] Peter Empson: Agreed
[26/02/2025, 15:28:47] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll push the button on the interim purchase which will keep us going for another 3-4 months. Thereafter we will either need to striuke up a deal with their distributor, hope the market price is levelled and or move into new prdouct lines. I really want to increase our coffee bean sales
[26/02/2025, 15:30:22] Peter Empson: We would need to be a lot keener on expected ROAS, I don’t believe that an d800% target is realistic. We would be up against some big boys with deep pockets so it has to be a very good proposition
[26/02/2025, 15:32:12] Sam Amdjadi: lets do a little joint analysis on this. let me know your recommendations please - some market info/terms/pricing/ existing players would be a great way to look at this
[26/02/2025, 15:32:33] Sam Amdjadi: a quick search showed me a small glasgow based roastry. that tells me there is business there if they can afford to do it
[28/02/2025, 11:46:39] Sam Amdjadi: Its not looking good on the Fellow front i’m afraid. It’s going to be a blow and we’ll need to consider our spend etc
[28/02/2025, 13:59:08] Peter Empson: When will Fellow disappear? The budget is underspending so I don’t see any reason to cut that back as there are many other products hitting  or close to the required ROAS
[28/02/2025, 14:02:57] Peter Empson: What is it you searched for? This could be a local search result rather than a full blown search campaign
[28/02/2025, 14:04:31] Peter Empson: Do you have a Google My Business account?
[28/02/2025, 14:17:44] Sam Amdjadi: discussions are ongoing - both for a final order and with their uk distributor to see what the pricing will be.
[04/03/2025, 14:32:06] Sam Amdjadi: *Woocomerce > Shopify* 

As part of building scale and managing cost, i think this is something to seriously embark upon. Our hosting cost are getting out of hand, as are processing costs. @⁨Peter Empson⁩ do you have any clients who have migrated or do you have any experience with this process / know anyone that could help?
[04/03/2025, 14:33:16] Peter Empson: https://amasty.com/woocommerce-to-shopify-migration-service.html
[04/03/2025, 14:34:22] Peter Empson: I have no experience of working with them but noticed them in the past when I’ve been researching
[04/03/2025, 14:34:28] Peter Empson: Some big clients in the list
[04/03/2025, 14:35:38] Peter Empson: I would be delighted if you migrated! 😊
[04/03/2025, 14:35:53] Sam Amdjadi: looks a big project
[04/03/2025, 14:36:08] Sam Amdjadi: but it seems without it, we’re always going to be stuck
[04/03/2025, 14:36:27] Peter Empson: I think you’ll find it would be easier than you think
[04/03/2025, 14:36:38] Peter Empson: Its the design taht would bve the hardest thing
[04/03/2025, 14:36:49] Peter Empson: But you have something for them to work off
[04/03/2025, 14:37:07] Peter Empson: They may not actually handle the site design, they may just do the migration
[04/03/2025, 14:37:27] Peter Empson: Shopify is definitely the way forward
[04/03/2025, 14:38:16] Sam Amdjadi: not losing ranking, site structure etc / connectivity with in store system. Feels a massive headache but..
[04/03/2025, 14:38:53] Peter Empson: Amasty do a number of Shopify apps which I have used in the past
[04/03/2025, 14:39:03] Sam Amdjadi: it may be that we have to stop everything for a period whilst this takes place
[04/03/2025, 14:40:12] Peter Empson: The migration of the data should be a press of a button at the last minute. The design can all be worked on before the final change over
[04/03/2025, 14:40:58] Sam Amdjadi: everything is a press of button 🙂
[04/03/2025, 14:41:24] Sam Amdjadi: we run lightspeed as store pos but it also talks to woocommerce to manage stock etc
[04/03/2025, 14:41:34] Peter Empson: It just depends how big the button is!
[04/03/2025, 14:41:53] Sam Amdjadi: ‘backspace’
[04/03/2025, 14:42:11] Peter Empson: https://litextension.com/shopify-migration/lightspeed-to-shopify-migration.html
[04/03/2025, 14:42:54] Peter Empson: https://www.shopify.com/uk/pos/shopify-vs-lightspeed
[04/03/2025, 14:43:06] Sam Amdjadi: its probably a 1 month project for someone to do it properly and considertately
[04/03/2025, 14:44:25] Peter Empson: This guy? https://www.fiverr.com/pressgurucorp/install-woocommerce-plugin-and-products-listing-with-variations
[04/03/2025, 14:44:43] Sam Amdjadi: this looks interesting
[04/03/2025, 14:45:01] Peter Empson: Makes it a bit easier
[04/03/2025, 14:45:26] Sam Amdjadi: our images are being hosted by aws
[04/03/2025, 14:45:36] Sam Amdjadi: let me talk to these guys and see what happens
[04/03/2025, 14:45:49] Sam Amdjadi: WP hosting have us over a barrel atm
[04/03/2025, 14:45:52] Sam Amdjadi: want silly money for hosting
[04/03/2025, 14:45:56] Peter Empson: The Fiverr guy looks interesting
[04/03/2025, 14:46:02] Sam Amdjadi: 1k a month
[04/03/2025, 14:46:20] Peter Empson: I’ve used Fiverr for a few things and not been disappointed
[04/03/2025, 14:46:54] Peter Empson: TBH I don’t know what sort of price hosting is all I know is that with Shopify you can just turn it up if ypu need it
[04/03/2025, 14:49:06] Sam Amdjadi: to put some context, we paid $35 before as i host the images on AWS
[04/03/2025, 14:51:57] Peter Empson: Its likely to be more than that so that you get something that is quick and resilient. Shopify use a cdn on their own site
[04/03/2025, 14:54:14] Peter Empson: I would suggest contacting Amasty and getting a quote from a couple of people on Fiverr. The good thing is you have a site up and running that you can compare with. You wont need to pay until you’re happy its working
[07/03/2025, 14:34:37] Peter Empson: Were there any site issues yesterday? The sales were low and I can’t see any problems with the ads
[07/03/2025, 14:35:35] Sam Amdjadi: no site issues and we’re a little preplexed today also. Having to let staff member off early
[07/03/2025, 14:41:18] Peter Empson: Clicks and impressions on the ads were slightly up on the previous week so no apparent reason why it was ‎<This message was edited>
[10/03/2025, 09:36:31] Sam Amdjadi: Pause ads please. Site down
[10/03/2025, 09:49:15] Peter Empson: Ok 5 mins
[10/03/2025, 09:55:38] Peter Empson: DOne
[10/03/2025, 10:08:24] Sam Amdjadi: seems a domain issu e
[10/03/2025, 10:15:59] Sam Amdjadi: on phone to hosting / domain etc - one of this has messed up
[10/03/2025, 10:18:10] Peter Empson: Ok, I’m travelling at the moment but just ping me a message when it’s back up I’ll sort it
[10/03/2025, 13:18:01] Sam Amdjadi: bloody domain hosting company issue. bit of a farce but we’re getting somewhere. Can you try the site and let me know what you see your end? best to do on a new device if possibler to avoid cache
[10/03/2025, 13:55:50] Peter Empson: Looks like there is a problem with the SSL certificate, can’t view the site via https
[10/03/2025, 14:46:28] Peter Empson: Is it the SSL certificate that has expired?
[10/03/2025, 14:47:23] Sam Amdjadi: first problem was ionos. now wp engine
[10/03/2025, 14:47:29] Sam Amdjadi: they are resolving just now
[10/03/2025, 15:09:21] Sam Amdjadi: looks like we’re finally back up. can tyou check from your side too
[10/03/2025, 15:09:40] Peter Empson: Site looks good
[10/03/2025, 15:10:16] Peter Empson: I’ll fire everything up
‎[10/03/2025, 15:10:42] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[10/03/2025, 15:11:06] Peter Empson: Back to warp speed!
‎[25/03/2025, 20:00:25] Zoe Godshot: ‎image omitted
[25/03/2025, 20:02:35] Peter Empson: Yes but why? This is one one of several ads that are running and being optimised dependent on their performance
[25/03/2025, 20:03:56] Zoe Godshot: Mostly the name is bothering me - it should be ‘Godshot studio’
[25/03/2025, 20:04:49] Peter Empson: Ok, I’ll change it.
[25/03/2025, 21:20:05] Peter Empson: Sorted!
[28/03/2025, 14:58:20] Peter Empson: Hi great day on Wednesday - what was the reason? Google Ads did well but the majority was not the Ads, was it a newsletter?
[28/03/2025, 15:02:39] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll give you three guesses 😂
[28/03/2025, 15:03:03] Peter Empson: It was a sale last time
[28/03/2025, 15:04:10] Peter Empson: Recommendation in the media/socials
‎[28/03/2025, 15:04:12] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[28/03/2025, 15:04:24] Peter Empson: Sale?
[28/03/2025, 15:04:32] Sam Amdjadi: yeah - sale event
[28/03/2025, 15:04:44] Sam Amdjadi: were we basically drop our pants. heck we take them off and run around naked
[28/03/2025, 15:04:55] Sam Amdjadi: upshot: big sales £16k+
[28/03/2025, 15:05:00] Peter Empson: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[28/03/2025, 15:05:07] Sam Amdjadi: downside:  probably loss of -£3k+
[28/03/2025, 15:05:20] Peter Empson: Its amazing that so many people are just hanginga round waiting for a price drop
[28/03/2025, 15:06:04] Peter Empson: The conversion rate doubled over night
[28/03/2025, 15:06:15] Sam Amdjadi: a couple of reasons to do: 

1. its part of our ethos - get products into hands that otherwise couldnt afford 
2. ⁠good buzz/digital noise/incremental benefit that can’t easily be quantified 
3. ⁠bring in much needed cash despite the losses
[28/03/2025, 15:06:36] Peter Empson: Increase the customer base/audience
[28/03/2025, 15:06:51] Sam Amdjadi: but its clear we have (approx) two sets of customers: 

1. those that pay full price and are regular customers 
2. ⁠those that only buy on sales
[28/03/2025, 15:07:13] Peter Empson: Its such a huge number that buy in the sales - i’m staggered
[28/03/2025, 15:07:57] Sam Amdjadi: the prices are great tbh. when i say we make losses, its genuine. most of the products are great niche brands that these customers know of or trust given we stock them, and the price is suddenly insane
[28/03/2025, 15:08:18] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve also gotten good at utilising instagram / mailchimp to drive time bound interest
[28/03/2025, 15:08:46] Sam Amdjadi: i’m hoping the digital noise from such an event helps google also
[28/03/2025, 15:08:51] Peter Empson: It dioes screw the Google algorithm up a bit. If you do it again could you give me at least 48 hours notice so that I can let Google know that it is going to happen and for how long
[28/03/2025, 15:09:07] Peter Empson: Was it just 24 hours?
[28/03/2025, 15:09:13] Sam Amdjadi: 2-3 hours
[28/03/2025, 15:09:50] Peter Empson: Wow!!!!!!
[28/03/2025, 15:24:43] Peter Empson: Next time could you do it on a per brand basis?
[28/03/2025, 15:25:25] Peter Empson: If you let me know when the sales are going to be I can run the feed immediately after the price changes so that the ads have the right price
[28/03/2025, 15:27:07] Sam Amdjadi: sure
[28/03/2025, 15:27:39] Sam Amdjadi: we didnt have fellow or kinto last night, so that means lots and lots of smaller brands
[28/03/2025, 15:27:59] Peter Empson: and yet Kinto sold well
[28/03/2025, 15:28:52] Sam Amdjadi: these are the incremental benefits - that old adage of ‘only came for milk!’
‎[28/03/2025, 15:28:55] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[28/03/2025, 15:29:28] Peter Empson: So a single brand sale could help the margin
[28/03/2025, 15:33:02] Sam Amdjadi: describe what you mean please
[28/03/2025, 15:34:36] Peter Empson: If you jsu had a sale on Kinto for instance then you could get additional sales on other products at the same time. The draw is the sale price
[28/03/2025, 15:35:22] Peter Empson: And it would be wise to play with the discount, did you go too low?
[28/03/2025, 15:35:22] Sam Amdjadi: our thinking is to reduce some prices from time to time and let a slower pace take place from google visitors
[28/03/2025, 15:35:34] Sam Amdjadi: maintain a level of margin whilst clearing slower selling items
[28/03/2025, 15:36:06] Sam Amdjadi: the raising of cash was the important element and i wanted to drive that in a short time frame
[28/03/2025, 15:39:40] Peter Empson: Google Ads revenue on that day went up by 340% on the previous day and ROAS was up the same amount. This is despite any preparation so if there had been the effects would have been greater
[28/03/2025, 15:45:55] Peter Empson: £170 for £4,327 revenue
[24/04/2025, 15:56:55] Peter Empson: Do you have any EAN numbers for Malin & Goetz?
[30/04/2025, 13:11:50] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, can you pause ads please. a part of the ceiling in our warehouse has collapsed and we need to urgently find out what to do
[30/04/2025, 13:15:21] Peter Empson: Ouch, yep no problem
[06/05/2025, 15:31:07] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, how’s it going?
[06/05/2025, 18:35:08] Sam Amdjadi: Not good unfortunately. The full extent of the issue isn’t clear and we’ve had to suspend courier collection etc until we decide on next step. Atm ‘easiest’ is to find a new home. It’s a little bit devastating considering the efforts..
[06/05/2025, 20:28:55] Peter Empson: Absolutely, really feel for you. Is it part of the cafe?
[06/05/2025, 20:45:11] Sam Amdjadi: No it’s the other space we were using specially for e-commerce
[06/05/2025, 20:48:06] Peter Empson: I presume that’s a lot of stock to shift
[07/05/2025, 11:21:19] Sam Amdjadi: stock, shelving systems, tools for packing, pick pack material and all the ancillary things. We’ve a builder coming this week to advise what is possible. Moving also means significant rent/rates as the market here is buoyant
[07/05/2025, 11:25:18] Peter Empson: Wow that was some collapse
[07/05/2025, 12:29:58] Sam Amdjadi: theres been a water leak for almost a year and we did warn the agency managing the tenants above us. Turns out there were 8 adults living in a 3 bed flat!
[07/05/2025, 12:31:18] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve suspended all delivery services now on site
[07/05/2025, 12:37:38] Peter Empson: Ok
[07/05/2025, 12:38:44] Peter Empson: I won’t be charging you from May 1st until we get going again, hope this helps. It would be good to get the payments up to date
[07/05/2025, 12:39:35] Sam Amdjadi: ok will do - we’re going to use this opportunity to revisit a few other infrastructure issues so that the downtime isnt wasted
[07/05/2025, 12:47:47] Peter Empson: Good idea, let me know if I can help
[07/05/2025, 14:17:36] Sam Amdjadi: thanks - we need to get over the emotional set back a little. its been hard
[19/05/2025, 17:20:27] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, I’m away on holiday from the 21st for a few weeks but will be taking my laptop away so that I can continue to work. 

Whats the current situation with the site
[19/05/2025, 17:35:26] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, we’ve a builder in to try and rectify things temporarily from our side. There is some movements on the upstairs flat. Overall, i dont see us being to work in that space for at least the next 4-6 weeks. we’re waiting on offers we’ve made on neighbouring units, but its proving very challenging. i’ll keep you posted
[19/05/2025, 17:36:41] Peter Empson: OK Sam, good luck with it all
[19/05/2025, 17:38:14] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks Peter
[11/06/2025, 14:30:41] Peter Empson: Hi, hope things are progressing well for you.

If and when you need to start your Google Ads account again you will need to carry out advertiser verification, you will see the link when you log into the Google Ads account. This is a Google requirement and every account has to go through it.

Could you also look to paying the overdue balance of my invoices which is £2,286. Like you I am a small business and any delay in payment impacts heavily on me. I have sent a statement via email for your convenience.
[13/06/2025, 15:02:17] Peter Empson: Thanks Sam
[04/07/2025, 16:02:14] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, hope you’re doing OK. How are things progressing?
[09/07/2025, 11:27:23] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, so we’ve got a builder in to gut the place. He’ll be finished next week. We’ve also moved our stock room to an area near the rear. I think. by end of this month we’ll be done and hopefullyt early august ready to restart
[09/07/2025, 11:29:04] Sam Amdjadi: the only problem is that all this is coming at a considerable cost - £17k. Whilst the builder has agreed a bit of a payment plan, it’s hit us quite hard. So we’re having to think how to run the site so as to recoup some of this - its been quite a blow emotionally as well as financially. how are things with you?
[09/07/2025, 11:29:57] Peter Empson: Having building work is never comfortable is it ‎<This message was edited>
[09/07/2025, 11:31:45] Peter Empson: The big thing in your favour is that the site was generating sales at a good ROAS. I appreciate that this was in part down to the pricing but you did seem to have the knack of sourcing desirable products that had a small amount of competition
[09/07/2025, 11:33:00] Peter Empson: Restarting the ads will not instantly get us back to where we were, the pause will have been damaging. I am all for taking it easy t start with, just like when we did it last time.
[09/07/2025, 11:33:24] Peter Empson: Good to see you’ve battled through it
[09/07/2025, 11:34:59] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll need to take a close look at our stock - we’ve quite a bit of stock that we have to get rid of. lets see what we can do. one option is to just utilise the small free traffic and targeted instagram sale events. But maybe there are other options like targets / small scale ads etc. be good to have a proper chat when the works are done
[09/07/2025, 11:40:56] Peter Empson: Look forward to it
[18/08/2025, 16:36:11] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, just checking in. Hope everything's all right with you guys. How's the building work going?
[01/09/2025, 10:32:56] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, the building work finished a couple of weeks ago and we’re dealing with the tidying up and moving of stocks to new locations which should finish in next two weeks. Thereafter our thoughts were to allow ordering on the site and see how things go before considering switching ads back on. Finances have been decimated
[01/09/2025, 10:33:58] Peter Empson: That's great news, it's nearly finished, Sam. I can imagine it has taken a big chunk out of any sort of profit that you had.

I'm here when you need me. Happy to have a chat.
[01/09/2025, 11:07:43] Sam Amdjadi: apart from all the building costs incurred, we had ordered lots of stocks which arrived and have had to be paid for. I’m not sure about any profits as such - these are all only on paper in a continually evolving stock business - but our cashflow is back to zero so we have to try and build that up
[10/09/2025, 08:17:50] Peter Empson: Morning Sam. I've just had an email to say that your feed management software on the website is due for renewal. The annual fee is $144.49, and it's my credit card that they have to charge it. Do you wish to continue with this or not? Please bear in mind that if we want to restart the ads at a future date, we'd have to rebuild the template for this.
[10/09/2025, 10:38:01] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, we are working hard towards reinstating ads in the next 2 weeks or so. Best to renew this please. Is there any scope in terms of how we engage - e.g. no charge for first 2-3 months until we build up cashflow again. If this isn’t possible, we could try this ourselves until sales build up and then engage you again. I’ve spoken to several of our suppliers about extended terms/support etc to allow us some further sku’s so that we can reluanch properly
[10/09/2025, 11:29:47] Peter Empson: Hi Sam,

I'll let them know you want to renew, and I'll send you an invoice for the subscription 

I can't work that long for free. The purpose of the Google Ads is to generate cash flow. I can do one month and then revert to the original rate we had. By this time, we should be generating some good levels of sales.
[15/09/2025, 11:55:40] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, i guess that could work if we can build up some cash behind us. Atm we are working towards getting ready to properly trade from Oct 1st. We may run a sale event to try and build some immediate cashflow and to support some existing overdue invoices. 

If we can get back to 1k a day quickly, then i think we will be able to stablise things and get back to a sustainable run rate. I’m using the opportunity atm to speak to shopify and the like with a view to migrate the site
[18/09/2025, 11:13:20] Sam Amdjadi: approx timeline: atm we’ve got a sale announced for the 8th Oct. That will take us 2-3 days to deal with. So perhaps Mon 13th would be a good date to restart ads
[18/09/2025, 11:23:20] Peter Empson: Great. How long is the sale on for?
[18/09/2025, 11:29:22] Sam Amdjadi: 3 hours 🙂
[18/09/2025, 11:29:45] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve organised couriers to start coming from 13th also
[18/09/2025, 11:30:51] Sam Amdjadi: we’re hoping there will be a big spike in traffic, activity on site, sales despite the loss, and momentum will help with a successful restart of ads
[18/09/2025, 11:31:57] Peter Empson: Okay, it's a shame I can't jump on that, but it's far too short a time span and is before your proposed start date on the ads 

Please don't expect a quick take of sales and profitability. The ads and the products have laid dormant for a number of months now, and it will take time to warm them up
[18/09/2025, 11:32:27] Peter Empson: I've already been looking at Merchant Centre making sure it's all set up correctly. There are a few issues with it which have now been resolved. I'll also take a look at the Google Ads well before the proposed launch date.
[18/09/2025, 11:36:17] Sam Amdjadi: Our intention is to hold steady and review after 30 days. That will tell us if we can make it sustainable. We’re doing things from our side such as sharpening up prices and so on. 

£500 a day sales would be a tight, £1k would be workable from my calculations (notwithstanding the profile of sales: products, margin on those etc). As i say, we want to do all we can and review after a month. The infrastructure here is better than before, and we’re a lot of learning behind us so lets see how it goes 🤞
‎[24/09/2025, 13:44:20] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[24/09/2025, 14:06:11] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, could you please complete the advertiser verification on the Google Ads website? You just need to log into Google Ads and click the menu item
[24/09/2025, 14:06:17] Peter Empson: That makes more sense!
[26/09/2025, 10:57:12] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, I strongly recommend that you do this as soon as possible as it may delay starting the ads up again as I’m not sure how long it takes Google to check the docs you upload
[26/09/2025, 11:08:26] Sam Amdjadi: Ok let me check
[26/09/2025, 11:09:05] Peter Empson: It just needs a few business documents, such as:
- Certificate of Incorporation
- VAT registration certificate
[28/09/2025, 11:17:12] Sam Amdjadi: companies house name is different so in the first instance, i have had to apply to change that
[28/09/2025, 11:17:26] Sam Amdjadi: thereafter i can supply those documents
[28/09/2025, 11:19:05] Peter Empson: Thanks for the update Sam
‎[29/09/2025, 12:46:04] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[29/09/2025, 12:48:18] Peter Empson: It should not be an issue, you can still trade as another company name. The only thing we won't be able to do is use the Godshot brand as the brand name in the ads, but that's not a big issue. I have a client for whom I advertise three different websites in the same Google Ads account. None of the names of those websites matches their company name.
[29/09/2025, 12:50:02] Sam Amdjadi: i uploaded our companies house docs etc but it did not accept. alternatively i can retain the name as it (Godshot studio) and upload documents to verify but that will say SamSan and i believe they may reject verification
[29/09/2025, 12:50:46] Peter Empson: They're just verifying the company name that owns the Google Ads account not the website that is being advertised
[29/09/2025, 12:51:11] Sam Amdjadi: let me know input the details and see what happens
[29/09/2025, 12:52:05] Peter Empson: Not sure what you mean here Sam? You are saying that you are going to verify the SamSan Limited name and see what happens?

[29/09/2025, 12:57:13] Peter Empson: Great stuff, we should know in a couple of days about whether its OK

[29/09/2025, 15:06:11] Sam Amdjadi: the latter cannot be changed without something showing Godshot studio > SamSan Ltd
[29/09/2025, 15:06:47] Sam Amdjadi: i may change who pays
[29/09/2025, 15:09:26] Peter Empson: Change account names in your manager account

[29/09/2025, 15:09:34] Peter Empson: I presume you've followed this, have you?
[29/09/2025, 15:09:47] Peter Empson: I'm afraid I've not actually done this before, so I'm not much help
[29/09/2025, 15:10:28] Peter Empson: The worst-case scenario is that we start up a new Google Ads account, but I can attach the old Merchant Centre account to it. It's the Merchant Centre account that will have the history of the performance of the products in it.
[29/09/2025, 15:10:56] Sam Amdjadi: its best we get to the bottom of this - i’ll need to dig around a little
[29/09/2025, 15:17:14] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve set up a new ‘payer’ and profile so lets see if this now works

[30/09/2025, 07:46:41] Peter Empson: Nice one Sam, you are now the leading expert!
[07/10/2025, 11:32:26] Peter Empson: Morning, Sam. Are we still on target for going live with the ads on the 13th?
[07/10/2025, 16:44:14] Sam Amdjadi: hey Peter, yep - very much so. its all systems go atm. we need a good sale event tomorrow night to bring in some cash to meet supplier payment plans obligations.
[09/10/2025, 14:33:42] Sam Amdjadi: in run up, we’re checking a lot of our pricing. I assume google feeds will take our sale prices? perhaps evern show original with slash: 

https://mygodshot.com/product/fellow-opus-conical-burr-grinder/
[09/10/2025, 14:35:18] Peter Empson: Yes, it may say ‘sale’ or ‘price drop’ as well.

The caveat is it hasn’t seen your live prices for a while so it may not take it as being a sale price. A sale price is where something has been reduced from a previously known price
[09/10/2025, 14:35:57] Sam Amdjadi: lets see how it goes. we want to ramp things up rather than sudden shock to the system
[09/10/2025, 14:36:22] Sam Amdjadi: this gives us a chance to steady ourselves operationally. we’re still coming to grips with ‘snagging’ such as courier issues etc
[09/10/2025, 14:36:30] Peter Empson: ok
[09/10/2025, 22:45:42] Sam Amdjadi: Let’s start ads Wednesday instead please. Sale event went well but the flip side is a huge dispatch operation
[09/10/2025, 22:46:11] Peter Empson: No problem
[09/10/2025, 22:46:18] Peter Empson: Glad it went well
[16/10/2025, 16:19:17] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, are we good to go with the ads?
[16/10/2025, 16:19:39] Sam Amdjadi: hi peter, lets do it
[16/10/2025, 16:20:12] Peter Empson: Great, enabling the campaigns now
[16/10/2025, 16:20:42] Peter Empson: £50/day to start?
[16/10/2025, 16:21:19] Peter Empson: When we paused, it was £170 per day
[16/10/2025, 16:22:11] Sam Amdjadi: ok lets start at 50
[16/10/2025, 16:22:29] Peter Empson: I'll keep you up to date with spend
[20/10/2025, 14:05:53] Peter Empson: Wow that was a quick start! 17 conversions since Thursday at a ROAS of 714%. 
So that's a cost of £186 and a revenue of £1300
[20/10/2025, 14:07:04] Sam Amdjadi: thats great - can you see the conversions are directly coming from the spend? it would be good for us to know whats repeat, and whats new. For example we received quite a few coffee order
[20/10/2025, 14:09:34] Peter Empson: They are the conversions that have been reported in Google Ads so they're sales that are directly attributable to that spend.

In Google Ads, you can't see what people have bought once they've come onto the site. You can see which shopping ads or which search ads have been clicked on, but not the actual products they bought
[20/10/2025, 14:14:47] Sam Amdjadi: ok - lets give it till 16 nov and see how its looking. We’re competing harder on pricing across key brands like kinto. It eats into margin but we have to get it to minimum £500 a day sales
[20/10/2025, 14:30:33] Peter Empson: I consider these to be exceptional figures, certainly in an e-commerce environment, I've not come across them before. Why are you putting a time limit on it if they are doing so well? i need to try and match your expectations here Sam could you share with me what you are expecting
[20/10/2025, 14:34:13] Sam Amdjadi: its not a time limit as such - its more of a lets analyse after a sustained period. The other key issue is stock. Sales need stock, and stock needs cash and availability. Its a time consuming and challenging arm of the operational layer needed to sustain a multi category website. This time of year, the 100’s of brands we work with, come under inventory strain so the challenge is particulary felt. Anyway, its a good start!
[20/10/2025, 14:35:55] Peter Empson: The great thing with Google Ads is that they don't ask for the money until you've received yours from the customer. This should help cash flow somewhat.

It's interesting to see some completely different products are firing off this time around and they seem to have taken hold very very quickly.
[20/10/2025, 14:36:58] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve lost Fellow somewhat - change of distribution and margin fractured - but i am working on seeing if we can get a workable deal from their new uk distributor
[26/10/2025, 09:56:59] Peter Empson: Hi Sam,

There is flexibility in the budget to go from £50 a day to £64 a day and still keep the same ROAS as we currently are. The target ROAS is 700, and we've actually achieved 1000 since the campaigns were switched back on again, which is incredible. Things are really going to start ramping up now, so we need to look at what this budget can stretch to. It's certainly producing a return for you.
[26/10/2025, 14:19:58] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, ok lets do it. 

i’m conscious that there is a dance here that needs to be managed closely: sales > stocks > cash > ops. Atm you only have visibility of sales. 

Ops can be managed by throwing more at it and breaking ourselves physically, but stock isn’t always as easy due to differing lead times, and cash can yo yo depending on mix of sales. For example many suppliers have moq’s and upfront payment terms. So we may buy 3k of stock and only a portion of is fast selling. Do this for 10 brands and suddenly £20 of cash is locked up etc. I’m only sharing this with you so you are aware of our constraints. 

But we share the same goal: grow sales as fast and profitability as possible. Internally we have another goal: create a sustainable environment for growth. We want to get sales to at least 1k a day with a minimum profitability that allows us to hire someone and reinvest into stocks which allows us to grow again. We don’t want to switch off ads again.
[26/10/2025, 14:21:23] Peter Empson: I anticipate I will be back to you cap in hand at the end of next week if not sooner
[03/11/2025, 15:43:44] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, current budget is £64 a day. Recommended budget is £190 a day. In the last seven days, we've hit a ROAS of 1,337% which is enormous. We've not really hit the start of Q4 peak yet, and we're hitting these numbers. In the past seven days, the spend has gone up by 25%, and the conversion value by 38%. I would strongly suggest we increase the budget.
[03/11/2025, 21:04:26] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, my concern atm is our stock position. We have around 15 new orders outstanding that will trickle in during the next fortnight. I assume an increased budget will focus only on clicks that result in sales. I.e. therefore o/s items are unaffected
[03/11/2025, 21:05:11] Peter Empson: If an item is out of stock it will not be shown in an advert
[03/11/2025, 21:06:37] Sam Amdjadi: then lets pump up the volume and see what the next 7 days brings
[03/11/2025, 21:06:43] Sam Amdjadi: now you put that cap away!
[03/11/2025, 21:08:08] Peter Empson: We’re swinging onto peak now and your products are in demand, I’m sure the spend will need to be increased again very soon ‎<This message was edited>
[04/11/2025, 11:34:41] Sam Amdjadi: unfortunately it looks like someone is attacking our checkout this morning from the US. We’ve had 300+ failed orders
[04/11/2025, 11:35:00] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve had to switch off paypal. you any experience of this?
[04/11/2025, 12:26:04] Peter Empson: That's not great. Have you asked Shopify about it?
[04/11/2025, 12:26:28] Peter Empson: Is that your only payment method using PayPal, or do you have another payment provider?
[04/11/2025, 15:55:22] Sam Amdjadi: we use woocommerce and have other payment options so its not a problem on that front. its more the bandwidth issue and concern around security
[04/11/2025, 16:03:55] Peter Empson: Did you manage to get in touch with Shopify?
[04/11/2025, 16:04:38] Sam Amdjadi: yes but its a bit of a project to migrate and mirror the same design, and now not a good time. But they are probably better overall
[04/11/2025, 16:04:59] Peter Empson: OK
[06/11/2025, 12:28:29] Sam Amdjadi: less orders last 24 hours
[06/11/2025, 15:13:01] Peter Empson: Do you think it’s PayPal?
[06/11/2025, 15:16:51] Sam Amdjadi: doubt it but i have switched it back on earlier
[11/11/2025, 09:21:15] Peter Empson: Hi Sam Fellow is performing particularly badly. in particular, the grinder. If you feel as though we're not competitive with the product anymore, I could choose to not advertise it ‎<This message was edited>
[11/11/2025, 09:30:52] Peter Empson: To clarify the numbers: Over the last 2 weeks, Fellow Ode Grinder has cost £210 but only converted on 5 out of 11 days. When it does convert it's strong (1,200-2,000% return), but we had a 4-day stretch (Nov 4-7) where £82 was spent with zero sales. Other Fellow products (Opus Bundle, Corvo EKG) have spent £55 with nothing back at all. If you think pricing is the issue or it's just not worth the volatility heading into Q4, I can pause them and put that budget elsewhere. Let me know what you reckon.
[11/11/2025, 10:43:37] Sam Amdjadi: hi Peter, thanks for sharing this - yes let me have a look at pricing first but Fellow as a brand are one we are phasing out for a variety of reasons. Pricing, returns, cost of storage due to size and cost of shipping, with parcels often going ‘missing’
[11/11/2025, 19:19:34] Sam Amdjadi: Question: can we set headline price of a product say £90 but then offer a 10% discount voucher on the google ad?
[11/11/2025, 19:19:58] Peter Empson: Yes
‎[11/11/2025, 19:20:00] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[11/11/2025, 19:23:51] Peter Empson: It will say offer on it, you click the offer and the voucher is shown
[11/11/2025, 19:29:04] Sam Amdjadi: we’re coming into a bit of pressure from some brands to raise their pricing, so we’re thinking to do so but offer a discount code
[11/11/2025, 19:29:23] Peter Empson: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/11/2025, 19:30:17] Peter Empson: It’s a possibility but you can’t beat a low price
[11/11/2025, 19:31:05] Sam Amdjadi: true
[11/11/2025, 19:31:13] Sam Amdjadi: but at least this keeps us in the game!
[11/11/2025, 19:41:41] Peter Empson: I’ll need a list of products and details of the offer
[11/11/2025, 19:42:13] Sam Amdjadi: lets wait another week and see how it plays out here
[11/11/2025, 19:42:23] Sam Amdjadi: the main one is zoologist
[11/11/2025, 19:42:44] Sam Amdjadi: can we call it introductory offer?
[11/11/2025, 19:49:12] Sam Amdjadi: want to hear more good news?
[11/11/2025, 19:49:34] Sam Amdjadi: someone has been copying all of our fragrances and is opening a store not far away this week 🙂
[11/11/2025, 19:55:22] Peter Empson: That’s not great, we’ll need to sell more online!
[11/11/2025, 20:00:08] Sam Amdjadi: 3 lines of attack although we’ve been caught on the back foot: 

1. Bring in new brands and tie them to exclusivity 
2. ⁠Agree exclusivity with any existing brands we can 
2. ⁠Sell more online
[11/11/2025, 20:00:55] Peter Empson: I’m up for 2.2
[11/11/2025, 20:02:33] Sam Amdjadi: I also forgot:

2. Move on from some brands

[12/11/2025, 12:27:51] Peter Empson: Yes, no problem. I'm just linking it to my AI tool.
[12/11/2025, 12:27:58] Peter Empson: Well spotted. Thanks for letting me know.
[14/11/2025, 12:56:09] Sam Amdjadi: some atrocious pricing out there. The only model we’re the best price on is the Aiden. Everything else is slashed. So best to stop ads

[14/11/2025, 15:59:18] Peter Empson: Can you confirm you want all ads stopping for the Fellow brand
‎[14/11/2025, 16:00:31] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
‎[16/11/2025, 20:56:30] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[16/11/2025, 21:07:21] Peter Empson: I’ve paused all product ads for Fellow, please confirm this is what you want
[16/11/2025, 21:08:23] Sam Amdjadi: missed this - if its not performing, thats its the way to go, although we do have stocks we want to clear out. Particularly the sizeable Aiden which we have best price in market for
[16/11/2025, 21:09:13] Peter Empson: So you'll not be able to clear the stocks if we switch the ads off.?
[16/11/2025, 21:10:00] Sam Amdjadi: so i guess we can’t display Aiden without others
[16/11/2025, 21:11:27] Peter Empson: We can do it if that's what you want.
[16/11/2025, 21:12:00] Sam Amdjadi: thats what i was hinting at 😉
[16/11/2025, 21:13:14] Peter Empson: I can’t work on hints Sam, I need decisions I’m afraid
[16/11/2025, 21:14:03] Sam Amdjadi: i thought this was pretty clear. Fellow = no, but Aiden = yes. I’ll be more blunt in future
[16/11/2025, 21:14:15] Peter Empson: Suits me!

[16/11/2025, 21:15:02] Peter Empson: We are now a month in from when this all started again, can I assume that we are now working to the same contractual terms as previously, where there is a management fee of £600 per month.
[16/11/2025, 21:15:40] Sam Amdjadi: yes i think we hit our min target, but it would be great if you could send me link to dashboard to check figures / data etc
[16/11/2025, 21:16:49] Peter Empson: You are a user on Google Ads on your Gmail account.
[16/11/2025, 21:16:53] Peter Empson: sam.amdjadi@gmail.com
[16/11/2025, 21:25:32] Sam Amdjadi: so you turned off your little dashboard
[17/11/2025, 11:07:16] Sam Amdjadi: let me know if this is something we need to do from our side
[17/11/2025, 11:08:16] Peter Empson: Do you set shipping prices against products, or is it an overall shipping price?
[17/11/2025, 11:12:02] Zoe Godshot: Overall shipping prices but depends what’s in the order.
Orders containing only coffee = £2
Orders containing anything else up to a value of £100 = £3.99
Orders worth £100 or more = free
[17/11/2025, 11:13:43] Sam Amdjadi: Atm our coffee shipping price on on ads is incorrect and will be deterring buyers
[17/11/2025, 11:18:21] Peter Empson: I'm not sure whether Merchant Centre actually allows this sort of pricing, where it changes the shipping price if there is a specific product within the basket.
[17/11/2025, 11:18:32] Peter Empson: I've never come across it before.
[17/11/2025, 11:18:40] Peter Empson: I'll check it out.
[17/11/2025, 11:19:15] Sam Amdjadi: lets try to keep it simple for now and just show £2 if we’re advertising any coffees on google
[17/11/2025, 11:19:50] Peter Empson: Yeah, it's not that straightforward. It's all been driven by Google Merchant Centre, or it comes through against the product. I need to look at how it's working.
[17/11/2025, 11:22:01] Zoe Godshot: We’ve no option to set a shipping price per product, but is there something else we can do on the website?
[17/11/2025, 11:22:45] Peter Empson: Nothing that would affect the shopping ads. Let me just check on it
‎[17/11/2025, 11:35:04] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[17/11/2025, 14:03:47] Peter Empson: The latest shipping price you can see on there for the £200 product is picking up something that's set up in Merchant Centre for free delivery over £99.99.
[17/11/2025, 14:06:49] Peter Empson: I've set up a delivery type for coffee beans. These will have a delivery charge of £2, which will appear in the adverts. If you want to see the product IDs it applies to, I've shared them with you in a Google Sheet
[17/11/2025, 14:09:10] Peter Empson: It might take a while for this still a recharge to get through the system, so you might not see it on the ad straight away. I will check tomorrow.
[18/11/2025, 09:37:44] Sam Amdjadi: great - reflected on google and i think already a little lift in sales
[18/11/2025, 09:39:46] Sam Amdjadi: lets go ahead with this please as our sales on this completely dried up

on all Zoologist fragrance:

[18/11/2025, 14:45:02] Peter Empson: These take quite a while to set up.
[18/11/2025, 14:50:10] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks - lets see if sales resuscitate
[18/11/2025, 14:53:55] Sam Amdjadi: there are two european sellers undercutting uk pricing. We’ve complained to the brand who have made this ridiculous reply: 

We have informed them and they said they would update the price. Bloom and slick boys have been selling at regular price for a while and they have never mentioned about them.
[18/11/2025, 14:54:10] Sam Amdjadi: if they don’t increased their price very soon, we will simply match them
[18/11/2025, 14:54:41] Peter Empson: Sounds fair enough.
‎[18/11/2025, 14:56:39] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[18/11/2025, 15:00:57] Peter Empson: Putting the code on is a good response to this. I'll keep you informed of how it goes.
[18/11/2025, 15:02:09] Sam Amdjadi: great - if no imporvement in a day or two, we’ll just have to drop pricing and remove code
[19/11/2025, 11:26:20] Sam Amdjadi: we immediately got a sale overnight 🙂
[19/11/2025, 11:26:48] Peter Empson: Awesome ‎<This message was edited>

Is the Strawberry Kiss one a new one?
[19/11/2025, 12:18:56] Zoe Godshot: The range changes frequently, so products go inactive and then active again. We usually have 10-20 active at any one time, but probably more than 100 different coffees with new ones added from time to time
[19/11/2025, 12:21:32] Peter Empson: The system uses a field called shipping label to denote the £2 delivery charge. I have to set this manually, but is there anywhere within your system where you can see shipping label? If not, can you give me a list of all the product IDs that this would apply to? Long-term, I'd like to set up a different product feed, but there's no time before Christmas to do that.
[19/11/2025, 12:35:01] Peter Empson: Quick update on peak season performance (Nov 1-19):

Current numbers:
• £3,081 spent → £19,751 revenue
• 641% ROAS (£6.41 per £1)
• £162/day average spend
• 287 sales at £10.73 each

You've already scaled 5.8x from October (was £28/day) and ROAS is still strong at 641%.

Budget's hitting limits most days. With Fake Friday this Friday (22nd) and Black Friday next Friday (29th), we need overhead on the spend or we'll be limited during the biggest sales days.

Recommend increasing to at least £300/day through peak - should maintain 500%+ ROAS based on current demand.

Worth pushing to capture full Black Friday opportunity?
[20/11/2025, 10:39:26] Peter Empson: Is this something you want me to go ahead with?

**Original Note:**
[05/09/2024, 13:46:39] Sam Amdjadi: Hi @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩ , Peter and I have been talking but in short, the Fellow ads are back up and running. We’ll need to obtain stock on one or two lines in meantime
[05/09/2024, 13:46:46] Sam Amdjadi: Fellow Tally in particular
[05/09/2024, 13:49:32] Zoe Godshot: Ok sounds good
[05/09/2024, 21:14:25] Sam Amdjadi: Hi @⁨Peter Empson⁩ any chance you could review us here? Unfortunately we had an issue in that a disgruntled young ex employee who had embarked on a campaign of negative reviews via her friends. We managed to have almost all of them removed earlier today by taking legal advice. That said, our rating which was previously 4.9 still hasn’t got back to that. Long story short, we need reviews and dont’ want to pester too many customers. 

https://g.page/r/Cd4vDImMUIPDEAE/review
[05/09/2024, 21:18:38] Peter Empson: Ok
[05/09/2024, 21:27:05] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks 🙌
[06/09/2024, 12:57:48] Peter Empson: Do you have a contact at your hosting provider? I am constantly getting 502 gateway errors when trying to download the data feed and CHannable say we need to look in the server logs
[06/09/2024, 13:32:34] Sam Amdjadi: so its WP Engine and I’m going to add you just now as a technical contact
[06/09/2024, 13:32:53] Sam Amdjadi: Seems you’re already added
[06/09/2024, 13:33:30] Sam Amdjadi: heres the email I’ve used to correspond with them in the past: 

support+id6882583@wpengine.zendesk.com
[06/09/2024, 14:01:15] Peter Empson: Great, I’ll get in touch with them ‎<This message was edited>
[09/09/2024, 14:38:32] Sam Amdjadi: *New brand - Anglepoise* 

I’m in the process of making a considerable investment to try and onboard this brand. I wanted to find out how strong this is from an online point of view. They certainly have a strong name in the UK and the 90 mini mini series seems popular. @⁨Peter Empson⁩ can you provide some thoughts please
‎[09/09/2024, 14:44:54] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[09/09/2024, 14:45:13] Peter Empson: The benchmark is John Lewis
[09/09/2024, 14:46:47] Sam Amdjadi: they are currently matching angle poise own website who have an offer of £92. This will revert to £103. Regardless, we can compete with John Lewis and get to £90 if required. Cash margin would be around £30 on that price. So it will be interesting to estimate the cost per conversion
[09/09/2024, 14:47:29] Sam Amdjadi: John Lewis have much improved their product detail pages, but I think @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩ can do better her also
[09/09/2024, 15:14:58] Peter Empson: I’m afraid it’s not straightforward to estimate a CPA if there is no data to go on. The CPA would be dependent on the conversion rate which in the case of the products you have on at the moment is just under 4%.. If a 4% conversion rate could be achieved on Anglepoise then the CPA would be £6.17 but there are a lot of ifs, buts and maybes in there not least that we would need to get exposure on the ads which is not a quick thing to do because of the way that Google takes time to assess the products and ads
[09/09/2024, 15:35:58] Sam Amdjadi: I think around that could work. i suppose the only way is to try and then review
[09/09/2024, 15:36:08] Sam Amdjadi: I’ll advance discussion with Anglepoise
[09/09/2024, 15:36:35] Peter Empson: Ye sthat would be the only way we could know for sure but it depends how much its going to cost you to find out
[09/09/2024, 15:52:54] Sam Amdjadi: lets see what we can agree in terms of initial stock purchase
[15/09/2024, 12:59:39] Sam Amdjadi: @⁨Peter Empson⁩ might be good to just turn on all ads so we can see how the next week goes. Keen to get sales up so we can see how Fellow will do and what kind of stocks we need to order
[15/09/2024, 13:23:22] Peter Empson: Ok.
[15/09/2024, 20:46:50] Peter Empson: All ads are re-activated but the budget will need increasing from £20/day. I would suggest at least £35
[15/09/2024, 21:42:15] Sam Amdjadi: Let’s try it and see what happens
[15/09/2024, 22:00:11] Peter Empson: Done, budget is £35/day - please don’t expect miracles straight awayit needs to get momentm going again

[19/09/2024, 11:08:05] Peter Empson: Do you have an EAN numbers for the Fellow Carter Wide Mugs?
[19/09/2024, 11:11:17] Zoe Godshot: I’ll check the packaging this afternoon
[19/09/2024, 11:14:57] Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe
[20/09/2024, 14:59:23] Zoe Godshot: Hi Peter, I checked our stock and we are still selling through the Carter Everywhere mugs at the moment, so we don’t actually have any Carter Wide Mugs to hand. Not sure if both products share the same codes, but I think the only difference between them is the name. Here are the barcodes from the packaging—

Stone blue: 84022802471
Matte grey: 852212007847
Matte white: 852212007823
Matte black: 852212007809
Cargo green OOS
[23/09/2024, 17:19:09] Peter Empson: Sales up 42% on last month already with a spend of £405 which is a ROAS of 700%.
Just wanted to check in with you both that this is OK and not putting to much of a strain on operations and stock ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2024, 09:21:44] Sam Amdjadi: yeah we’ve been keeping a close eye on this - thanks for checking in. Operationally Zoe is hit but we’re making it work. Unfortunately we had an issue in store with a young (malicious) member of staff and this reached havoc - the remanence of which we’re dealing with (including helping in store). 

But the good news we’re meeting a couple of people later today to help with pick/pack and stock receiving/inventory checks. 

We’ve been able to react to stock requirements and are reasonably well positioned on that front for further growth. ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2024, 09:35:58] Peter Empson: Thanks Sam, sorry to hear that. As the account re-establishes itself the volume of traffic available to us will increase, already there is potential to spend another £10 per day and still achieve the same ROAS target. Let me know when you are ready to expand a bit more.
[24/09/2024, 09:38:15] Peter Empson: It would help if you had some EANs for the Lochby journal, it is flying but it is limited in its reach by not having an EAN
[24/09/2024, 12:11:24] Zoe Godshot: Where are these added to the website? I’ve added to Lightspeed but not sure it translates
[24/09/2024, 13:45:49] Peter Empson: Hi Zoe, I’m afraid I don’t know - Sam’s your man
[24/09/2024, 13:55:50] Zoe Godshot: So how do they assist ads? Is there somewhere else that EANs are inputted?
[24/09/2024, 14:04:57] Peter Empson: Somehow Sam has inputted them into the Woocommerce cataogue so that when I extract the data I can put them into Google Merchant Centre. GMC is where the info for the ads is taken from , having the EAN number makes for more comlete data and enables the ads to show in more places
[24/09/2024, 14:12:52] Zoe Godshot: Ah ok I see. Could you give me an example of a product that has an EAN so I can find where it’s been entered on lightspeed/ woocommerce?
[24/09/2024, 14:13:49] Peter Empson: Most of the Fellows products have them, try https://mygodshot.com/product/fellow-opus-conical-burr-grinder/?attribute_pa_fellow-colour=matte-black 
I have this as product id 17785 ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2024, 14:14:12] Peter Empson: EAN is 840228803997
[24/09/2024, 14:16:47] Zoe Godshot: I’ve just had a quick look and it’s nowhere immediately obvious… @⁨Sam Amdjadi⁩?
[26/09/2024, 11:21:53] Peter Empson: The account is currently being constrained by the budget which is set at £35/day. There is potential to hit the current target ROAS of 700% with a higher daily budget which would result in higher sales volume. In April the budget was £80/day and the target ROAS was being hit.
The suggested budget is £65/day, are you ready for this sort of increase in sales?
[27/09/2024, 11:41:41] Sam Amdjadi: I guess theres only one way to find out - lets do it and see what happens 🤞
[02/10/2024, 09:28:15] Sam Amdjadi: ads were paused I believe due to a payment issue. I had to update card details due to an issue with old card. Please keep an eye on ads today
[02/10/2024, 09:48:50] Peter Empson: …every day 😀 Thanks for the heads-up
[11/10/2024, 10:51:11] Peter Empson: After a month of to-ing and fro-ing between the hosting company and Channable I have had to take the decision to replace Channable with another data feed management system which I have just implemented. It wasn’t the easiest of implementations and despite my best endeavours there are a few discrepancies in the feed but they are minor and not in fields that have a huge influence on visibility. I’m not expecting any changes to performance but you can never guarantee how Google will react to changes.
I have also been working on optimising the product titles so that they get the best exposure for the products. This process is an ongoing one and I’m prioritising the best sellers first
[11/10/2024, 11:01:17] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks for the update. Zoe and I had been chatting about how we can make improvements here also. We’ve noticed Fellow isn’t performing as it previously was - do you have any info on this. In other news, we’ve brought Anglepoise on and will be working on adding them in, as well as another exciting brand
‎[11/10/2024, 11:02:40] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[11/10/2024, 11:05:42] Peter Empson: Its interesting how many other brands are working as well now - Dak, Rains, 19-69, Kinto - better not to have all your eggs in one basket
[11/10/2024, 11:07:06] Peter Empson: At the risk of sounding like a stuck record I could do with more GTINS if possible - Rains, 19-69 and KInto for starters
[25/10/2024, 12:05:20] Peter Empson: Is it possible to match the prices for Fellow?
[25/10/2024, 12:08:04] Sam Amdjadi: Hey Peter, a little update from our side:

- we’ve been stretched to the limit the past month working 7 days to support the physical space (staff issues) 
- ⁠we’ve purchased new shelving to optimise the storage space for e-commerce 
- ⁠I’m training someone to support Zoe so she can put more time to product addition and supporting you
[25/10/2024, 12:09:15] Sam Amdjadi: on top of all of those, stupid things have decimated our time and mental energy: blocked drain at shop and other fixes.
[25/10/2024, 12:09:16] Peter Empson: Awesome, that’s all positive but not great about being so stretched
[25/10/2024, 12:10:02] Peter Empson: I’ll stick to the digital world although that does produce its own challenges!
[25/10/2024, 12:14:44] Sam Amdjadi: We have days when we just want to stop. Its been exhausting of late and getting covid in the midst of it didnt help. But like you say, we all have issues of sorts and have to find a way to navigate them whilst staying sane
[25/10/2024, 12:16:07] Peter Empson: You’re building something great Sam
[25/10/2024, 12:17:34] Sam Amdjadi: maybe we’ll have to eventually shut down the physical store that is draining so much of our time and focus online only
[25/10/2024, 12:18:03] Peter Empson: Could it support a full time manager?
[25/10/2024, 12:19:23] Sam Amdjadi: Finding people that care is very difficult here but its certainly something we have to consider. The store is struggling with the existing manager
[25/10/2024, 12:19:27] Sam Amdjadi: (lesley) n
[25/10/2024, 12:20:19] Peter Empson: I must admit its why I’ve never grown the business
[25/10/2024, 12:21:39] Sam Amdjadi: if you can keep it staff free, I would. In any business I’ve owned, staff are the number one problem (and opportunity). Most independent businesses in Glasgow now try to operate a model to avoid recruitment. e.g. open only 3 days etc
[25/10/2024, 12:25:14] Zoe Godshot: I’ve put Opus at £175 from £185, reviewed Stagg also but seems to be competitive at £150 with free delivery.
Are there other lines we should reduce?
[25/10/2024, 12:27:49] Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe
[25/10/2024, 12:28:20] Peter Empson: The sales on all of Fellow have dropped dramatically, it might be worth revieweing the top sellers and comparing online
[28/10/2024, 16:24:28] Sam Amdjadi: Anglepoise: we’ve now got these in stock. They are the best sellers and we can match Amazon

[29/10/2024, 17:25:16] Peter Empson: It seems to be setting a bar on price along with Lamp Twist
[29/10/2024, 17:25:54] Sam Amdjadi: I belive they are grey import
[29/10/2024, 17:26:19] Sam Amdjadi: We can emphasise our credentials as uk and authorise partner
[29/10/2024, 17:26:47] Peter Empson: We can’t do that in the shopping ad tho’
[29/10/2024, 17:27:07] Peter Empson: We can try the £214.99 as it undercuts John Lewis
[29/10/2024, 17:27:26] Sam Amdjadi: There is no doubt that customer will initially click them but see quite quickly it’s a 6 week lead time
[29/10/2024, 17:27:53] Peter Empson: The only way is to test it and see what we get
[29/10/2024, 17:28:03] Peter Empson: Rarthet go in too high than too low
[29/10/2024, 17:28:11] Peter Empson: Preserve the margin
[29/10/2024, 17:28:52] Sam Amdjadi: I think 214 is a competitive start. We can always bring down a bit of required
[29/10/2024, 17:29:39] Peter Empson: OK
[29/10/2024, 17:30:19] Peter Empson: I could put these in a separate campaign to start with so that we can get some traction but it would be at a lower target ROAS
[29/10/2024, 17:39:40] Sam Amdjadi: Sounds good. Zoe will recheck the product pages tonight also
[29/10/2024, 22:02:16] Peter Empson: Having the GTINs for the Anglepoise lamps would really help with it being so competitive
[29/10/2024, 22:15:21] Sam Amdjadi: Zoe has updated pricing and stock. Will forward gtins tomorrow whne have packaging in front of me
[29/10/2024, 23:03:45] Sam Amdjadi: It would be great to get to the bottom of fellow sales. We’re fairly overstocked (big investment) and I’m always worried with such products that it can very easily become out of date if they release something new
[29/10/2024, 23:04:08] Sam Amdjadi: we have completely stopped amazon sales (by from from fellow)
‎[30/10/2024, 01:02:09] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[30/10/2024, 07:25:59] Peter Empson: Free delivery was set so that it wa soirders over£100 so I have changed that to £99.99
[30/10/2024, 08:28:42] Peter Empson: With the Fellow products there are now a lot more competitors in the market lace who are offering free delivery and who maybe have lower ROAS targets than we do
[30/10/2024, 08:47:21] Peter Empson: There are quite a few Fellow products that do not have ‘Fellow’ set as the brand name. I use the brand name to group products together so if it isn’t set then the product will not be contained in the grouping e.g. 19558, 19551

[31/10/2024, 10:19:27] Sam Amdjadi: yeah
[31/10/2024, 10:20:38] Peter Empson: Shop ratings show with Search Network campaigns and they'll only serve in a country when one of the following criteria is met:

Google has received or collected enough unique reviews for the country within the last 24 months across Google Customer Reviews or our third-party review partners to confidently calculate a shop rating. The number of reviews needed can vary from business to business, but most merchants are able to obtain a rating after collecting 100 or more eligible reviews.
Google or its partners have completed a research evaluation of your site.
Additionally, both of the following criteria must be met:

Average, composite, rating of 3.5 or more stars for text ads
Unpaid listings can show shop ratings if the average rating is less than 3.5 stars
The ad’s visible URL domain must match the domain for which we have the ratings
[31/10/2024, 10:20:53] Peter Empson: Are you collecting product reviews via Trustpilot?
[31/10/2024, 10:21:38] Sam Amdjadi: Not sure about product, but Zoe has been working on these

https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.mygodshot.com
[31/10/2024, 10:21:39] Peter Empson: If you are then they will automatically be sending them to Google, when the threshold and criteria are met then Google may(or may not) show the reviews
[31/10/2024, 10:22:00] Peter Empson: The stars in the ads are product reviews
[31/10/2024, 10:22:07] Peter Empson: and relate to that product
[31/10/2024, 10:23:26] Peter Empson: If you are collecting product reviews/ratings then sooner or later I would suggest showing them on the relevant product pages
[31/10/2024, 10:29:52] Sam Amdjadi: *Stutterheim* A brand i’ve worked to bring on board and we have access to keen pricing. 

Is there something to be done online? This is their most popular product 

https://stutterheim.com/en-gb/men/best-sellers/stockholm-lightweight-light-sand
[31/10/2024, 10:30:12] Sam Amdjadi: We could sell for £150ish

‎[31/10/2024, 10:33:10] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 10:33:58] Sam Amdjadi: unfortunately thats the nature of these things - there are always cons. If you dig deeper, you’ll see that those prices relate to random sizes and one off’s
[31/10/2024, 10:34:37] Peter Empson: I find that you don’t know until you put the product up there. It would all depend on how aggressive the competition are with their bidding.

You’ve got to be careful that you don’t end up trying to be the Amazon of the higher end product world asyou could spread yourself too thinly
[31/10/2024, 10:36:23] Sam Amdjadi: My experience is trying to find a couple of products within a brand that are going under the radar, so to say. A bag, an accessory etc. Use that as the means to generate sales and gradually build the brand (in store / online)
[31/10/2024, 10:44:40] Zoe Godshot: It started because at some point I found I could upload swatches instead of have a drop down menu to select product variant and so implemented it brand by brand, creating a new attribute each time. In theory I could put them all under 1 attribute, but would there still be the same issue if I’m trying to distinguish colours that are the same by name but have different images? ie there may be 15 different variants called ‘red’ distinguished by different slugs

[31/10/2024, 10:49:42] Zoe Godshot: Yeah
‎[31/10/2024, 10:50:11] Zoe Godshot: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 10:50:20] Peter Empson: Mmmm I can see why you’ve done it
[31/10/2024, 10:50:55] Zoe Godshot: There is an argument for simplifying it though. We can’t allow customers to filter products by colour at the moment
[31/10/2024, 10:50:58] Peter Empson: Is there any way when you set the attribute you could also populate the ‘colour’ attribute at the same time?
[31/10/2024, 10:51:33] Peter Empson: You could use the brand colour for the swatches and the generic colour to filter
[31/10/2024, 10:51:48] Peter Empson: The swatches do look good
[31/10/2024, 11:07:00] Zoe Godshot: For the Google ads, is it as simple as creating the colours as variants under the main ‘colour’ attribute? Or does it need to be linked to the product in some way?
Ive added ‘Alessi Test Product’ to the site to play with. It’s got the Alessi colour attribute visible to customers, but also assigned the main ‘colour’ attribute hidden from customer view
[31/10/2024, 11:07:32] Peter Empson: I’ll take a look
[31/10/2024, 11:10:19] Peter Empson: color or colour?
[31/10/2024, 11:10:27] Peter Empson: There are 2 attributes
‎[31/10/2024, 11:11:11] Zoe Godshot: ‎image omitted
[31/10/2024, 11:13:56] Peter Empson: The proper spelling!
[31/10/2024, 11:15:07] Zoe Godshot: I believe ‘color’ was added by Lesley, certainly not me 😅
[31/10/2024, 11:15:47] Peter Empson: You’re off the hook!

[31/10/2024, 11:45:06] Peter Empson: There is also a product under 21515 which also has this colour
[31/10/2024, 11:45:34] Peter Empson: Its as though ithe colour has been set for the parent rather than the variants

[31/10/2024, 22:05:40] Peter Empson: OK
[06/11/2024, 08:33:23] Peter Empson: I could do with some EAN numbers for the Anglepoise range, these are very competitive so the more data we have in them the better. A spreadsheet with the 2 columns  - item id and EAN - would be more than enough
[08/11/2024, 14:20:23] Sam Amdjadi: We’ll get those to you today. I noticed a chrome 1227 mini sold!
[08/11/2024, 14:20:56] Sam Amdjadi: atm our sales seem mostly dependant on kinto and fellow. It would be good to get another heavy hitting brand onboard
[11/11/2024, 16:26:24] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, sorry for the delayed response I had an early finish on Friday. I'd set up an individual campaign for the anglepoise lamps, and that seems to be doing the trick (ROAS is over 400%). I'm actually quite surprised how quickly the campaign has taken off. Once we get a bit more traction, I'll put that into the standard P Max campaign.

[20/11/2024, 10:16:36] Peter Empson: So that is your business profile, it wont affect what I’m doing in Google Ads. Thanks for letting me know
[20/11/2024, 11:59:31] Sam Amdjadi: so two more things to share with you: 

1. Our instagram account of 4 years with 12,000 followers was somehow hacked over the weekend and we were held to ransom. We have no access and trying to contact meta. Its been traumatic and a completely nightmare. I contemplated just stopping everything as it so depressing after thousands of hours of work. 
2. ⁠We’ve got a sale event tonight at 7pm. Email will go out to newsletter subscribers. Not a profit maker but hoping to generate 10k sales to get rid of slow selling items.
[20/11/2024, 12:00:04] Peter Empson: Oh no!!!
[20/11/2024, 12:00:41] Peter Empson: I wish I could help you with that but its something I’ve not come across before
[20/11/2024, 12:01:02] Peter Empson: You’ve gone too far to stop now Sam!
[20/11/2024, 12:01:04] Sam Amdjadi: Its honestly so demoralising. I’ve managed to meta verify my personal account and speak to instagram
[20/11/2024, 12:01:27] Peter Empson: Fingers crossed for you
[20/11/2024, 12:49:45] Sam Amdjadi: thanks - I previously lost an account with 40k followers. Seems lighting does strike twice. I’m just perplexed how they accessed an account with 2 step verification..
[20/11/2024, 12:51:27] Sam Amdjadi: In other news, had a long discussion with WP Engine. They are going ot move us to a dedicated server with significantly improved service and performance
[20/11/2024, 12:51:44] Sam Amdjadi: migration taking place just now and should complete by 5pm
[20/11/2024, 14:05:48] Peter Empson: Thats good news
[20/11/2024, 14:06:30] Peter Empson: There are a lot of unnecessary plugins on Wordpress that could do wioth being removed, they will be slowing things down
[20/11/2024, 14:06:52] Sam Amdjadi: yeah I did a first fix recently. Planning on a second flush soon
[21/11/2024, 10:34:31] Peter Empson: What just happened?
[21/11/2024, 10:35:36] Peter Empson: That was some Sale!
[21/11/2024, 10:48:55] Sam Amdjadi: We’re now dealing with the aftermath. We were here till early hours. Big job now to manage/communicate/dispatch/arrange pick up etc.
[21/11/2024, 10:49:05] Sam Amdjadi: ultimately its not a money maker - we just wanted to clear out older stocks
[21/11/2024, 10:49:24] Sam Amdjadi: So overall a net loss but better to generate some cash to pay suppliers!]
[21/11/2024, 10:49:51] Peter Empson: and it gives the bid strategy some great data
[21/11/2024, 10:50:37] Sam Amdjadi: Such a shame our instagram is in limbo - it was a very warm audience and things would have gone even better last night
[21/11/2024, 10:51:34] Peter Empson: How much sale stock is left?
[21/11/2024, 10:51:53] Peter Empson: It goes to show how price sensitive the market is
[21/11/2024, 10:52:14] Peter Empson: better to do it the week before Black Friday when the clicks will be a lot more expensive
[21/11/2024, 10:53:41] Peter Empson: There is more capacity with the budget, its currently on £79 but could go to £130 but I would suspect you don’y t need any more traffic!
[21/11/2024, 10:54:19] Peter Empson: 29X ROAS yesterday
[21/11/2024, 11:03:46] Sam Amdjadi: our website now has more scale in theory in terms of bandwidth
[21/11/2024, 11:04:01] Sam Amdjadi: We’ve still some stocks left, but feeling a lot better than this time yesterday
[21/11/2024, 11:04:06] Sam Amdjadi: cash was getting very tight indeed
[21/11/2024, 11:04:17] Peter Empson: Do you want me to increase?
[21/11/2024, 11:04:54] Peter Empson: The pricing data will be invaluable for you going forward
[21/11/2024, 11:06:35] Sam Amdjadi: go ahead

[02/12/2024, 22:21:05] Peter Empson: You can see this here https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/result/r%2Fproduct?id=xwkrGqryebEZRK9BSZAX5A
[02/12/2024, 22:22:19] Peter Empson: Not sure what to suggest here, its a dev thing that I am not familiar with
[03/12/2024, 19:16:34] Peter Empson: Google are suggesting there is capacity to increase the budget by £300 a day (?!!??!!) I wouldn’t suggest going that far but it could be lifted by £100 per day if you have the stock, manpower and inclination
[18/12/2024, 10:48:11] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, so we’ve reached cut off now for delivery in so far as we’ll not really be able to get orders out for xmas. What is the best way to deal with google to avoid wasting ad spend
[18/12/2024, 10:48:35] Peter Empson: I will make the necessary adjustments
[20/12/2024, 10:26:59] Sam Amdjadi: no orders will now leave until well after xmas. Zoe will need a break from incessant packing until at least mid jan. so probably best to minimise ad spend to an absolute minimum
[20/12/2024, 10:40:24] Peter Empson: OK
[23/12/2024, 17:46:14] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, please pause all ads if not already done so - thanks. Have a lovely Christmas
[23/12/2024, 17:49:32] Peter Empson: Hi Sam
[23/12/2024, 17:50:56] Peter Empson: I have pulled the spend back dramatically since the 18th, its around £30/day now. I would rather keep the ads just ticking over rather than pausing them as the latter could affect them detrimentally when they go back on again. I can take it to £10/day?
[29/12/2024, 14:52:26] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, I’m looking to make plans for 2025 and naturally online represents the biggest growth for us. We did very well in Nov/Dec in terms of sales. Margin was hit hard as we targeted best pricing across big brands reducing prices by 30%+. But thats not necessarily an unmanageable situation. Operationally we were stretched also. The aim is now to take what we’ve learnt and move into 2025 with intentionality, starting with a headline plan: 

- annual turnover 
- ⁠annual marketing spend 
- ⁠return on spend 
- ⁠avg basket / daily sales 

I can then use this information to flesh out some kind of plan and ensure we are working in unison. It’d be good to have your thoughts around what happened and what could be
[30/12/2024, 11:16:13] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, we haven’t actually learnt enough from the sale in November and December to make a forecast. The sales during this period were off the back off high conversion rates brought about by sales prices and a seasonal increase. During the rest of the year these factors will not be in play and will affect the conversion rates that are achievable. 
In addition to this the campaigns were also limited by budget so I cannot tell what ROAS the campaigns would have been able to get given an elevated budget.
[30/12/2024, 11:52:40] Sam Amdjadi: I see - based on what we know so far, can we estimate some annual forecasts/targets? A lot of the operational, procurement rests on an element of planning. 

Our inc VAT turnover this year seems to be c.£270k but that of course includes non trading period of June > Aug and a stop/start approach. What investment from a marketing perspective is needed to get turnover to £1mill in 2025? I can then plan other elements of the business
[30/12/2024, 11:59:30] Peter Empson: I want to assist as much as I can Sam but thats a bit beyond my pay grade, this is full on business forecasting that will need to take a lot more into consideration than just the spend on Google. The campaigns are very much beholden to the products that the business has to offer and will flex dependent on the ROAS targets that are set. The spend in November/December was unprecedented due to the product offering and the seasonality, the site is unproven without those 2 factors and you will have new products being introduced next year that could affect those numbers dramatically.
In November we saw the numbers increase massively as the prices dropped and the budget was for a period of time untethered ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/2024, 12:02:08] Peter Empson: The budget at the moment on the account is £10 which brought is ROAS of 2500% yesterday but as that budget is increased the ROAS will fall as the campaigns start to advertise in more competitive areas. For the whole of December the ROAS was 1257% but that is not something that can be maintained the whole year and at this stage we don’t have a full year’s figures to look at to see what the seasonal variations will be. ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/2024, 12:08:37] Peter Empson: Revenue from Google this year was £155K with a ROAS of 947% on a budget of £16K but that was with no ads running from the end of May to September so that is 8 months. Given a full year with no budgetary restrictions to achieve a Google Ads turnover of £1m on a ROAS of, say, 700% would require a spend of £142K but that is a real back of a fag packet figure that has a lot of ifs, buts and maybes:-
Product offering
Product Pricing
Google Ads competition
Google Ads changes
plus other things
[30/12/2024, 12:09:37] Sam Amdjadi: could you send me details of the dashboard please so I can see our performance matrix. We have to base forecast based on something - even if it is a best guess - and thus determine budgets and best use of resources. Whilst we want to maintain a nimbleness and reactivity in this fledgeling business, it’s hard to attain growth if the targets are unclear.
[30/12/2024, 12:10:15] Peter Empson: Which dashboard, the Google Ads one?
[30/12/2024, 12:11:58] Sam Amdjadi: What we learnt: 

- Fellow is price driven but there is big opportunity online
- ⁠Kinto has a small basket size but highly popular 
- ⁠Fragrance sells better than expected although there is a large seasonality to it 
- ⁠Coffee beans is largely untapped and unknown 

Overall the winning formula appears the same: a few heavy hitting / high price ticket brands, complemented with variety to pull people back to spend.
[30/12/2024, 12:12:24] Sam Amdjadi: yeah your dashboard
[30/12/2024, 12:13:28] Peter Empson: You had a dashboard at the beginning of our engagement that I built using a software tool. This was removed when we had a break in summer so I will need to set that up again
[30/12/2024, 12:13:42] Sam Amdjadi: We’ve also not explored other areas. For example I am working on a white label matcha powder offering. We have excellent local reputation in this regard (and were mentioned in guardian also). Could this be an evergreen product for us (pardon the pun)
[30/12/2024, 12:14:23] Sam Amdjadi: could we set up a coffee subscription for Dak - they seem hugely popular and again no one really competing in uk
[30/12/2024, 12:14:46] Peter Empson: What i do with the ads is react to those business decisions you make on the ecommerce platform, I can’t make sales out of a bad product or one that is too expensive
[30/12/2024, 12:15:56] Sam Amdjadi: I suppose if our price is out, then people don’t visit the site in the first instance?
[30/12/2024, 12:16:42] Peter Empson: They may do but over time th ads will show less and less because the conversion rate would be poor and the campaign would not be hitting its ROAS target
[30/12/2024, 12:20:46] Sam Amdjadi: Forecasts should be based on our current pricing and product range in any event. I’ll have a look at our chat more carefully and it would be great to have some real insight into the past couple of months or if you’re able to set up that dashboard, then I can analyse from there. I’d like to understand the potential for next year. If I am to determine the marketing plan for 2025, then I need to understand more deeply how our marketing is operating at a fairly macro level, and align our product strategy more closely.
[30/12/2024, 12:21:59] Peter Empson: The dashboard is being built as we speak, it just takes a little time for it to pull all the data in  I’ll let you know when its done and give you your login details
[30/12/2024, 12:23:21] Peter Empson: The sooner we can increase the spend the better, we’ve gathered a lot of data over the last 2 months I don’t want it to just slip away
[30/12/2024, 12:24:02] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll let @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩ comment on that as operationally I know she is a little spent from the past month and we’re trying to train up someone new
[05/01/2025, 12:44:28] Peter Empson: Hi @⁨Zoe Godshot⁩, what are your thoughts on increasing the budget ever so slightly? The main shopping campaign has a daily budget of £5 and the recommended is £20. The £5 budget brought in 5 conversions yesterday so if it went to £20 then it would mean 12 orders a day.
I’m concerned that all the sales that were generated and shipped over the Christmas are not going to be used as effective traffic by Google unless we turn the dial up a bit
[05/01/2025, 12:47:28] Zoe Godshot: Hi Peter, let’s increase to £20 - thanks
[05/01/2025, 12:48:02] Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe, I hope you’ve had a relaxing break, it went crazy!
[05/01/2025, 13:05:42] Zoe Godshot: Yeah, it was a tough couple of weeks but a good learning curve. We’ll be better prepared next time 😄
[06/01/2025, 15:32:39] Peter Empson: The increase certainly did the trick! The sales look like they were boosted by the increase in budget, the ROAS was very good. Needless to say Google have calculated that there is potential to lift the budget from £20 to £70 if you wanted to
[06/01/2025, 15:33:35] Sam Amdjadi: Perhaps we should try it and see how it goes. I’ll also need to review the inventory positions
[06/01/2025, 15:34:42] Peter Empson: Agreed, we are always in control of the budget and it looks like you have hit a sweet spot with the product offering
[06/01/2025, 15:36:03] Sam Amdjadi: We’ve also just taken delivery of these - potentially a very in demand product and we have great pricing on it, if not the best online

[06/01/2025, 15:36:08] Peter Empson: I have no doubt I;’ll be coming back to you ahgain cap in hand by the end of the week
[06/01/2025, 15:36:23] Peter Empson: I’ve literally just been looking at those
[06/01/2025, 15:36:29] Peter Empson: One sold on Google Ads already
[06/01/2025, 15:36:58] Sam Amdjadi: its clear that fellow and kinto are big hitters for us. Perhaps we could consider trying to dominate both these brands. They should by themselves hit our daily targets
[06/01/2025, 15:37:45] Peter Empson: It has been that way pretty much from the start, along with Rains
[06/01/2025, 15:37:53] Sam Amdjadi: dak coffee is another. Big speciality coffee brand which is underrepresented online and businesses dont know how to manage the coffee buying / selling cycle like we do
[06/01/2025, 15:38:03] Sam Amdjadi: We’re replacing rains with Stutterheim
[06/01/2025, 15:39:46] Peter Empson: All good news Sam, its going to be important to keep ahead of the curve with these brands and try to aim for as much exclusivity as you can
[06/01/2025, 15:40:34] Sam Amdjadi: Exclusivity will be a challenge, but we can be competitive. Our website is also well presented and trust worthy, particularly as we have a physical store.
[06/01/2025, 15:41:50] Peter Empson: Love the new Fellow coffee machine but love my Chemex more!
[06/01/2025, 15:42:18] Sam Amdjadi: you’d pay cost price Peter if you wanted one.. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/01/2025, 15:43:17] Peter Empson: Appreciate that Sam, you tempted me enough to get the Timemore scales, its the Fellow burr grinder next but I’ll have to wait for my birthday! ‎<This message was edited>
[06/01/2025, 15:45:20] Sam Amdjadi: The ode will be a game changer - I recommend spending big on grinder
[06/01/2025, 15:45:52] Peter Empson: I thought you might 😂
[06/01/2025, 15:46:12] Sam Amdjadi: 🤑
[06/01/2025, 15:46:32] Sam Amdjadi: seriously though, after beans, 80% of the game is the grinder
[06/01/2025, 15:47:04] Peter Empson: Thats interesting, I do love the whole theatre of making a pour over
[06/01/2025, 15:47:37] Peter Empson: The De Longhi grinder I have is a bit ‘haphazard’
‎[06/01/2025, 15:49:28] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[06/01/2025, 15:51:01] Sam Amdjadi: You should come up some time and stay at our house for a few days. It would be good for you to see the set up, meet us and we can also talk coffee. We use the weber eg-1 with ulf burrs for filter at the store
[06/01/2025, 15:52:32] Peter Empson: I’m sure my wife and I are due a camping trip to Scotland some time this year, would love to come in and see how its done properly
[06/01/2025, 15:52:54] Peter Empson: That Weber is insane!
[06/01/2025, 15:53:43] Peter Empson: I find it incredible it makes such a difference to warrant that price
[06/01/2025, 15:54:35] Sam Amdjadi: The quality of the weber is unmatched. You can simply see it in the grounds it produces even before tasting
[06/01/2025, 15:54:43] Sam Amdjadi: its also a stunning piece of engineering
‎[06/01/2025, 15:55:08] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[06/01/2025, 15:55:23] Peter Empson: I can’t believe I’m watching the cleaning and maintenance video!
[06/01/2025, 15:56:36] Sam Amdjadi: coffee friend are also quoting 2 weeks delivery time. I believe people will choose us
[06/01/2025, 15:57:11] Sam Amdjadi: Its mostly magnetic so its easy
[06/01/2025, 15:59:04] Peter Empson: I think I’ll pull the Aiden into a single product campaign to see if I can increase its exposure
[06/01/2025, 15:59:39] Sam Amdjadi: That sounds like a good idea. I wonder if most of fellow would benefit from this
[06/01/2025, 16:02:15] Peter Empson: The other Feloow products are already up and running so they are doing OK. This product is new and is in a campaign with a target ROAS of 800% but it is bringing in well over 1000%. I will set the target to 600% knowing I’ll get at least 800% then I’ll put it back in the main campaign. It’s never a good thing to split the campaigns down too much as it reduces the stats the campaign has to work on.
[06/01/2025, 16:08:20] Peter Empson: Could do with an EAN number on the Fellow Aiden
‎[06/01/2025, 16:10:33] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[07/01/2025, 08:49:21] Peter Empson: Huge ramp up in sales yesterday and a 2000% ROAS on Google Ads. There is potential to now take the budget to £210/day and whilst I wouldn’t expect that the ROAS would stay at 2000% I would expect that we would get at least 800%. 
I appreciate that this is now a logistics/stock decision
[07/01/2025, 10:08:04] Sam Amdjadi: Yeah I noticed also. Let me check with Zoe and see if we can manage it. The biggest issue we have atm is finding someone suitable to work part/full time
[09/01/2025, 09:39:04] Sam Amdjadi: I think we’ll be readier in about a week for a potential increase. Our plan for January is: 

- recruitment 
- ⁠stock take / analysis 
- ⁠replenishment 
- ⁠process review 
- ⁠dpd onboard 

The idea is to improve infrastructure and try to push on this year
[09/01/2025, 09:56:09] Peter Empson: Makes sense and by the end of Jan things w
[09/01/2025, 09:57:02] Peter Empson: Will be on a more even keel
‎[09/01/2025, 15:53:45] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[09/01/2025, 15:54:44] Peter Empson: Thanks
‎[10/01/2025, 18:29:15] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[10/01/2025, 18:29:41] Sam Amdjadi: I adjusted down all fellow prices. Its quite a competitive landscape so our margin has naturally suffered
[16/01/2025, 15:19:02] Sam Amdjadi: just to share here also, we’ve appointed a full time member of staff to work on pick/pack and other related duties starting on the 11th Feb. Thats the first part of preparing for scale. Other plans include onboarding DPD in the next week, improving the space etc ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2025, 15:20:18] Peter Empson: Great! Thanks for letting me know
[16/01/2025, 15:20:47] Sam Amdjadi: We’re also working to expand our international reach with DPD / fedex accounts
[16/01/2025, 15:21:28] Peter Empson: It’s a tough old business shipping abroad, fraught with paperwork
[16/01/2025, 15:21:44] Sam Amdjadi: we’re getting better at it
[04/02/2025, 21:22:44] Peter Empson: Are you guys ready to turn the wick up slightly? The main campaign is £80 day with a potential for £210/day. Could I do another £30/day?
[04/02/2025, 21:58:58] Sam Amdjadi: natalia has joined the team and is starting next week. We think she will take a week to get to a reasonable standard - she’s already spent a bit of time with us. we’re also onboarding dpd next week. So i think in about 2 weeks will be a good time for us to catch up properly around budgets, campaigns and any activities we can undertake to increase sales. 

We came to the conclusion that increasing web sales to 500k this year would represent a positive step as long as margins were eroded too much. So thats the target for 2025
[06/02/2025, 08:33:45] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, total Gross sales were £35K in January with a Google Ads spend of £2,319. If we were to roll that out evenly over 12 months that would give a gross revenue of £420K without increasing the Google Ads budget. Doubling the Google Ads spend may not give exactly the same rate of return but it should still be acceptable and I would expect we could easily hit £500K. There was a sale in January, there will be seasonal peaks and troughs, it is dependent upon product and competition but I still think it is eminently  achievable.
[06/02/2025, 13:37:37] Sam Amdjadi: yeah i think its acheivable, not least because we are onboarding new brands, will make better use of our growing database and reputation, and there is always organic increase. That said, i expect road blocks too - brands pulling out or changing supply chain, growth pains and so on
[11/02/2025, 00:10:16] Sam Amdjadi: Hi peter, we are unmatched on our new prices on this brand which has good traction online. Might be worth its own campaigns

https://mygodshot.com/19-69/
[11/02/2025, 06:52:57] Peter Empson: Thanks Sam I’ll take a look
[11/02/2025, 13:06:28] Sam Amdjadi: the goal has to be to be number 1 for fragrances online in the UK. it ticks all the boxes for us: small item, good value, decent repeat, buy for self/gift, reasonable margin. What do you think - can you set in motion the actions to dominate this category @⁨Peter Empson⁩ ?
[11/02/2025, 13:09:09] Peter Empson: Hi Sam I understand that you want to dominate the category but be aware that there are bigger companies out there with far deeper pockets. I would suggest that we want to be number 1 for people who want to buy the product you sell. The separate ad group has been set up to target the 19-69 products so the ball is rolling ‎<This message was edited>
[11/02/2025, 13:25:02] Sam Amdjadi: i guess there are all always two camps of browsers: 

1. know the product they want (yes we want to dominate that if it’s something we have)
2. ⁠know they want niche fragrance. don’t know which they want. open to suggestion.
[11/02/2025, 13:25:50] Peter Empson: Agreed but to be No 1 in such a competitive market place would be very very expensive
[11/02/2025, 13:26:13] Sam Amdjadi: (1.) will always be cheaper to fight for and more immediate results. (2.) is a slower burner and lower conveersion in theory, but i wonder if we have ‘clever’ campaigns, it might be cheaper to target these lukewarm customers
[11/02/2025, 13:27:03] Sam Amdjadi: wasting money to be number 1 is of course neither an option, or something i would ever condone. i’m looking to see if we can generate ideas between us to devise smart strategies: procurement, marketing
[11/02/2025, 13:27:56] Sam Amdjadi: we need to find out the broad terms people are using, and see if we can get in their heads much earlier in the buying cycle
[17/02/2025, 15:16:55] Sam Amdjadi: *Products hidden* we’ve noticed a few products hidden from search on the site. Wondered if something you may have tweaked at all?

e.g.

https://mygodshot.com/product/anglepoise-original-1227-desk-lamp/
[17/02/2025, 15:17:30] Sam Amdjadi: above not showing in search
[17/02/2025, 15:18:14] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve fixed it now
[24/02/2025, 16:34:26] Peter Empson: Hi Sam can I turn the wick up? ROAS for the month to date is 774% and spend is about a third of what it could be.
[26/02/2025, 11:19:11] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, ok lets do it and see what happens
[26/02/2025, 11:19:46] Sam Amdjadi: orders atm are quite low by comparison and the new girl is much more up to speed so we need orders to keep her busy 😅
[26/02/2025, 11:30:57] Peter Empson: Great, what are you comparing them with? I’m seeing a constant £1500/day in Woocommerce
[26/02/2025, 12:15:35] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll need to look at the figures more closely but i guess its a just a feeling in terms of the number of orders that are being packed. Zoe feels its quietened down the past two weeks
[26/02/2025, 12:22:10] Peter Empson: Half term has made a bit of a difference across all my clients but your ROAS is still strong
[26/02/2025, 14:45:00] Sam Amdjadi: at loggerheads with Fellow. They are moving to a uk distributor imminently - who will hike prices up. Which in turn means we become less competitive etc.
[26/02/2025, 14:45:44] Sam Amdjadi: can we afford to say bye bye to them? they are accounting for about 25% of online sales. Can we refocus attention elsewhere - e.g. coffee bean sales instead. Smaller, more regular, easier to store/ship
[26/02/2025, 14:46:29] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve agreed one last purchase of around 20k which will decimate our cash position, but i’m unsure whether worse proceeding with. thoughts?
[26/02/2025, 15:13:41] Peter Empson: What we focus on is what people search for and what we can supply at a competitive price, we can’t just steer people in a different direction. In the last 30 days Fellow did the following on Google Ads:-
Revenue - £6,382
Cost - £876.63
ROAS - 728%
So it is around 25% of the Google sales and would be a big blow if the brand went. If they change their distributor will it not affect everyone’s prices?
[26/02/2025, 15:15:07] Sam Amdjadi: we have to react and find opportunity elsewhere. We had a good ride with Fellow and this is the nature of selling other peoples products: they do whats best for them.
[26/02/2025, 15:15:45] Sam Amdjadi: Fellow had an amazon shop and they ultimately want to lift the market price and move as many customers to buy from them there. This is what acheives them the highest margin. Its what i would do if i were them
[26/02/2025, 15:16:33] Sam Amdjadi: as for moving people, well we wouldnt be moving, but finding another healthy market in which we are competitive and there is enough customers. There must be plenty but coffee really springs to mind
[26/02/2025, 15:17:39] Sam Amdjadi: a long terms project for me is to onboard Timemore. Another coffee brand that has a bit of a standing and there is a decent audience
[26/02/2025, 15:19:27] Sam Amdjadi: can we do some digging around on the coffee beans market opportunity. Must be huge so its about establishing whether we can take 0.1% of that at a good price
[26/02/2025, 15:20:55] Sam Amdjadi: Another porject i’m costing out is roasting our own coffee. So learning to sell coffee online in high voliume would be a good string to our bow
[26/02/2025, 15:21:36] Peter Empson: We have built a good history of sales with Google on the Fellow and that is a very valuable commodity as it makes it difficult for newcomers to enter that space. This history takes time to build up so I agree that being agile is a good thing it doesn’t sit well with Google as they like consistency.
Your sales come from displaying products that relate to searches people put into Google - it’s intent based and is not something we can force. If we can display products that trigger for that search that are desirable and at the right price then people will buy them.
[26/02/2025, 15:27:39] Sam Amdjadi: i think it will take 6 months for fellow to flush out the cheaper stock in the market and then move everyone to a higher playing field. i think we can still retain them, but we have to start thinking longer term. Having these big hitting brands is a poisoned chalice: on the one hand if you can get the price right, the orders are there. On the other hand if you become dependent on them, they can pull the rug from under your feet. I’ve seen it happen many times. An ideal scenrario is spreading the sales amongst many brands, and eventually have a few of your own products
[26/02/2025, 15:28:03] Peter Empson: Agreed
[26/02/2025, 15:28:47] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll push the button on the interim purchase which will keep us going for another 3-4 months. Thereafter we will either need to striuke up a deal with their distributor, hope the market price is levelled and or move into new prdouct lines. I really want to increase our coffee bean sales
[26/02/2025, 15:30:22] Peter Empson: We would need to be a lot keener on expected ROAS, I don’t believe that an d800% target is realistic. We would be up against some big boys with deep pockets so it has to be a very good proposition
[26/02/2025, 15:32:12] Sam Amdjadi: lets do a little joint analysis on this. let me know your recommendations please - some market info/terms/pricing/ existing players would be a great way to look at this
[26/02/2025, 15:32:33] Sam Amdjadi: a quick search showed me a small glasgow based roastry. that tells me there is business there if they can afford to do it
[28/02/2025, 11:46:39] Sam Amdjadi: Its not looking good on the Fellow front i’m afraid. It’s going to be a blow and we’ll need to consider our spend etc
[28/02/2025, 13:59:08] Peter Empson: When will Fellow disappear? The budget is underspending so I don’t see any reason to cut that back as there are many other products hitting  or close to the required ROAS
[28/02/2025, 14:02:57] Peter Empson: What is it you searched for? This could be a local search result rather than a full blown search campaign
[28/02/2025, 14:04:31] Peter Empson: Do you have a Google My Business account?
[28/02/2025, 14:17:44] Sam Amdjadi: discussions are ongoing - both for a final order and with their uk distributor to see what the pricing will be.
[04/03/2025, 14:32:06] Sam Amdjadi: *Woocomerce > Shopify* 

As part of building scale and managing cost, i think this is something to seriously embark upon. Our hosting cost are getting out of hand, as are processing costs. @⁨Peter Empson⁩ do you have any clients who have migrated or do you have any experience with this process / know anyone that could help?
[04/03/2025, 14:33:16] Peter Empson: https://amasty.com/woocommerce-to-shopify-migration-service.html
[04/03/2025, 14:34:22] Peter Empson: I have no experience of working with them but noticed them in the past when I’ve been researching
[04/03/2025, 14:34:28] Peter Empson: Some big clients in the list
[04/03/2025, 14:35:38] Peter Empson: I would be delighted if you migrated! 😊
[04/03/2025, 14:35:53] Sam Amdjadi: looks a big project
[04/03/2025, 14:36:08] Sam Amdjadi: but it seems without it, we’re always going to be stuck
[04/03/2025, 14:36:27] Peter Empson: I think you’ll find it would be easier than you think
[04/03/2025, 14:36:38] Peter Empson: Its the design taht would bve the hardest thing
[04/03/2025, 14:36:49] Peter Empson: But you have something for them to work off
[04/03/2025, 14:37:07] Peter Empson: They may not actually handle the site design, they may just do the migration
[04/03/2025, 14:37:27] Peter Empson: Shopify is definitely the way forward
[04/03/2025, 14:38:16] Sam Amdjadi: not losing ranking, site structure etc / connectivity with in store system. Feels a massive headache but..
[04/03/2025, 14:38:53] Peter Empson: Amasty do a number of Shopify apps which I have used in the past
[04/03/2025, 14:39:03] Sam Amdjadi: it may be that we have to stop everything for a period whilst this takes place
[04/03/2025, 14:40:12] Peter Empson: The migration of the data should be a press of a button at the last minute. The design can all be worked on before the final change over
[04/03/2025, 14:40:58] Sam Amdjadi: everything is a press of button 🙂
[04/03/2025, 14:41:24] Sam Amdjadi: we run lightspeed as store pos but it also talks to woocommerce to manage stock etc
[04/03/2025, 14:41:34] Peter Empson: It just depends how big the button is!
[04/03/2025, 14:41:53] Sam Amdjadi: ‘backspace’

[04/03/2025, 14:43:06] Sam Amdjadi: its probably a 1 month project for someone to do it properly and considertately
[04/03/2025, 14:44:25] Peter Empson: This guy? https://www.fiverr.com/pressgurucorp/install-woocommerce-plugin-and-products-listing-with-variations
[04/03/2025, 14:44:43] Sam Amdjadi: this looks interesting
[04/03/2025, 14:45:01] Peter Empson: Makes it a bit easier
[04/03/2025, 14:45:26] Sam Amdjadi: our images are being hosted by aws
[04/03/2025, 14:45:36] Sam Amdjadi: let me talk to these guys and see what happens
[04/03/2025, 14:45:49] Sam Amdjadi: WP hosting have us over a barrel atm
[04/03/2025, 14:45:52] Sam Amdjadi: want silly money for hosting
[04/03/2025, 14:45:56] Peter Empson: The Fiverr guy looks interesting
[04/03/2025, 14:46:02] Sam Amdjadi: 1k a month
[04/03/2025, 14:46:20] Peter Empson: I’ve used Fiverr for a few things and not been disappointed
[04/03/2025, 14:46:54] Peter Empson: TBH I don’t know what sort of price hosting is all I know is that with Shopify you can just turn it up if ypu need it
[04/03/2025, 14:49:06] Sam Amdjadi: to put some context, we paid $35 before as i host the images on AWS
[04/03/2025, 14:51:57] Peter Empson: Its likely to be more than that so that you get something that is quick and resilient. Shopify use a cdn on their own site
[04/03/2025, 14:54:14] Peter Empson: I would suggest contacting Amasty and getting a quote from a couple of people on Fiverr. The good thing is you have a site up and running that you can compare with. You wont need to pay until you’re happy its working
[07/03/2025, 14:34:37] Peter Empson: Were there any site issues yesterday? The sales were low and I can’t see any problems with the ads
[07/03/2025, 14:35:35] Sam Amdjadi: no site issues and we’re a little preplexed today also. Having to let staff member off early
[07/03/2025, 14:41:18] Peter Empson: Clicks and impressions on the ads were slightly up on the previous week so no apparent reason why it was ‎<This message was edited>
[10/03/2025, 09:36:31] Sam Amdjadi: Pause ads please. Site down
[10/03/2025, 09:49:15] Peter Empson: Ok 5 mins
[10/03/2025, 09:55:38] Peter Empson: DOne
[10/03/2025, 10:08:24] Sam Amdjadi: seems a domain issu e
[10/03/2025, 10:15:59] Sam Amdjadi: on phone to hosting / domain etc - one of this has messed up
[10/03/2025, 10:18:10] Peter Empson: Ok, I’m travelling at the moment but just ping me a message when it’s back up I’ll sort it
[10/03/2025, 13:18:01] Sam Amdjadi: bloody domain hosting company issue. bit of a farce but we’re getting somewhere. Can you try the site and let me know what you see your end? best to do on a new device if possibler to avoid cache
[10/03/2025, 13:55:50] Peter Empson: Looks like there is a problem with the SSL certificate, can’t view the site via https
[10/03/2025, 14:46:28] Peter Empson: Is it the SSL certificate that has expired?
[10/03/2025, 14:47:23] Sam Amdjadi: first problem was ionos. now wp engine
[10/03/2025, 14:47:29] Sam Amdjadi: they are resolving just now
[10/03/2025, 15:09:21] Sam Amdjadi: looks like we’re finally back up. can tyou check from your side too
[10/03/2025, 15:09:40] Peter Empson: Site looks good
[10/03/2025, 15:10:16] Peter Empson: I’ll fire everything up
‎[10/03/2025, 15:10:42] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[10/03/2025, 15:11:06] Peter Empson: Back to warp speed!
‎[25/03/2025, 20:00:25] Zoe Godshot: ‎image omitted
[25/03/2025, 20:02:35] Peter Empson: Yes but why? This is one one of several ads that are running and being optimised dependent on their performance
[25/03/2025, 20:03:56] Zoe Godshot: Mostly the name is bothering me - it should be ‘Godshot studio’
[25/03/2025, 20:04:49] Peter Empson: Ok, I’ll change it.
[25/03/2025, 21:20:05] Peter Empson: Sorted!
[28/03/2025, 14:58:20] Peter Empson: Hi great day on Wednesday - what was the reason? Google Ads did well but the majority was not the Ads, was it a newsletter?
[28/03/2025, 15:02:39] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll give you three guesses 😂
[28/03/2025, 15:03:03] Peter Empson: It was a sale last time
[28/03/2025, 15:04:10] Peter Empson: Recommendation in the media/socials
‎[28/03/2025, 15:04:12] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[28/03/2025, 15:04:24] Peter Empson: Sale?
[28/03/2025, 15:04:32] Sam Amdjadi: yeah - sale event
[28/03/2025, 15:04:44] Sam Amdjadi: were we basically drop our pants. heck we take them off and run around naked
[28/03/2025, 15:04:55] Sam Amdjadi: upshot: big sales £16k+
[28/03/2025, 15:05:00] Peter Empson: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[28/03/2025, 15:05:07] Sam Amdjadi: downside:  probably loss of -£3k+
[28/03/2025, 15:05:20] Peter Empson: Its amazing that so many people are just hanginga round waiting for a price drop
[28/03/2025, 15:06:04] Peter Empson: The conversion rate doubled over night
[28/03/2025, 15:06:15] Sam Amdjadi: a couple of reasons to do: 

1. its part of our ethos - get products into hands that otherwise couldnt afford 
2. ⁠good buzz/digital noise/incremental benefit that can’t easily be quantified 
3. ⁠bring in much needed cash despite the losses
[28/03/2025, 15:06:36] Peter Empson: Increase the customer base/audience
[28/03/2025, 15:06:51] Sam Amdjadi: but its clear we have (approx) two sets of customers: 

1. those that pay full price and are regular customers 
2. ⁠those that only buy on sales
[28/03/2025, 15:07:13] Peter Empson: Its such a huge number that buy in the sales - i’m staggered
[28/03/2025, 15:07:57] Sam Amdjadi: the prices are great tbh. when i say we make losses, its genuine. most of the products are great niche brands that these customers know of or trust given we stock them, and the price is suddenly insane
[28/03/2025, 15:08:18] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve also gotten good at utilising instagram / mailchimp to drive time bound interest
[28/03/2025, 15:08:46] Sam Amdjadi: i’m hoping the digital noise from such an event helps google also
[28/03/2025, 15:08:51] Peter Empson: It dioes screw the Google algorithm up a bit. If you do it again could you give me at least 48 hours notice so that I can let Google know that it is going to happen and for how long
[28/03/2025, 15:09:07] Peter Empson: Was it just 24 hours?
[28/03/2025, 15:09:13] Sam Amdjadi: 2-3 hours
[28/03/2025, 15:09:50] Peter Empson: Wow!!!!!!
[28/03/2025, 15:24:43] Peter Empson: Next time could you do it on a per brand basis?
[28/03/2025, 15:25:25] Peter Empson: If you let me know when the sales are going to be I can run the feed immediately after the price changes so that the ads have the right price
[28/03/2025, 15:27:07] Sam Amdjadi: sure
[28/03/2025, 15:27:39] Sam Amdjadi: we didnt have fellow or kinto last night, so that means lots and lots of smaller brands
[28/03/2025, 15:27:59] Peter Empson: and yet Kinto sold well
[28/03/2025, 15:28:52] Sam Amdjadi: these are the incremental benefits - that old adage of ‘only came for milk!’
‎[28/03/2025, 15:28:55] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[28/03/2025, 15:29:28] Peter Empson: So a single brand sale could help the margin
[28/03/2025, 15:33:02] Sam Amdjadi: describe what you mean please
[28/03/2025, 15:34:36] Peter Empson: If you jsu had a sale on Kinto for instance then you could get additional sales on other products at the same time. The draw is the sale price
[28/03/2025, 15:35:22] Peter Empson: And it would be wise to play with the discount, did you go too low?
[28/03/2025, 15:35:22] Sam Amdjadi: our thinking is to reduce some prices from time to time and let a slower pace take place from google visitors
[28/03/2025, 15:35:34] Sam Amdjadi: maintain a level of margin whilst clearing slower selling items
[28/03/2025, 15:36:06] Sam Amdjadi: the raising of cash was the important element and i wanted to drive that in a short time frame
[28/03/2025, 15:39:40] Peter Empson: Google Ads revenue on that day went up by 340% on the previous day and ROAS was up the same amount. This is despite any preparation so if there had been the effects would have been greater
[28/03/2025, 15:45:55] Peter Empson: £170 for £4,327 revenue
[24/04/2025, 15:56:55] Peter Empson: Do you have any EAN numbers for Malin & Goetz?
[30/04/2025, 13:11:50] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, can you pause ads please. a part of the ceiling in our warehouse has collapsed and we need to urgently find out what to do
[30/04/2025, 13:15:21] Peter Empson: Ouch, yep no problem
[06/05/2025, 15:31:07] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, how’s it going?
[06/05/2025, 18:35:08] Sam Amdjadi: Not good unfortunately. The full extent of the issue isn’t clear and we’ve had to suspend courier collection etc until we decide on next step. Atm ‘easiest’ is to find a new home. It’s a little bit devastating considering the efforts..
[06/05/2025, 20:28:55] Peter Empson: Absolutely, really feel for you. Is it part of the cafe?
[06/05/2025, 20:45:11] Sam Amdjadi: No it’s the other space we were using specially for e-commerce
[06/05/2025, 20:48:06] Peter Empson: I presume that’s a lot of stock to shift
[07/05/2025, 11:21:19] Sam Amdjadi: stock, shelving systems, tools for packing, pick pack material and all the ancillary things. We’ve a builder coming this week to advise what is possible. Moving also means significant rent/rates as the market here is buoyant
[07/05/2025, 11:25:18] Peter Empson: Wow that was some collapse
[07/05/2025, 12:29:58] Sam Amdjadi: theres been a water leak for almost a year and we did warn the agency managing the tenants above us. Turns out there were 8 adults living in a 3 bed flat!
[07/05/2025, 12:31:18] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve suspended all delivery services now on site
[07/05/2025, 12:37:38] Peter Empson: Ok
[07/05/2025, 12:38:44] Peter Empson: I won’t be charging you from May 1st until we get going again, hope this helps. It would be good to get the payments up to date
[07/05/2025, 12:39:35] Sam Amdjadi: ok will do - we’re going to use this opportunity to revisit a few other infrastructure issues so that the downtime isnt wasted
[07/05/2025, 12:47:47] Peter Empson: Good idea, let me know if I can help
[07/05/2025, 14:17:36] Sam Amdjadi: thanks - we need to get over the emotional set back a little. its been hard
[19/05/2025, 17:20:27] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, I’m away on holiday from the 21st for a few weeks but will be taking my laptop away so that I can continue to work. 

Whats the current situation with the site
[19/05/2025, 17:35:26] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, we’ve a builder in to try and rectify things temporarily from our side. There is some movements on the upstairs flat. Overall, i dont see us being to work in that space for at least the next 4-6 weeks. we’re waiting on offers we’ve made on neighbouring units, but its proving very challenging. i’ll keep you posted
[19/05/2025, 17:36:41] Peter Empson: OK Sam, good luck with it all
[19/05/2025, 17:38:14] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks Peter
[11/06/2025, 14:30:41] Peter Empson: Hi, hope things are progressing well for you.

If and when you need to start your Google Ads account again you will need to carry out advertiser verification, you will see the link when you log into the Google Ads account. This is a Google requirement and every account has to go through it.

Could you also look to paying the overdue balance of my invoices which is £2,286. Like you I am a small business and any delay in payment impacts heavily on me. I have sent a statement via email for your convenience.
[13/06/2025, 15:02:17] Peter Empson: Thanks Sam
[04/07/2025, 16:02:14] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, hope you’re doing OK. How are things progressing?
[09/07/2025, 11:27:23] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, so we’ve got a builder in to gut the place. He’ll be finished next week. We’ve also moved our stock room to an area near the rear. I think. by end of this month we’ll be done and hopefullyt early august ready to restart
[09/07/2025, 11:29:04] Sam Amdjadi: the only problem is that all this is coming at a considerable cost - £17k. Whilst the builder has agreed a bit of a payment plan, it’s hit us quite hard. So we’re having to think how to run the site so as to recoup some of this - its been quite a blow emotionally as well as financially. how are things with you?
[09/07/2025, 11:29:57] Peter Empson: Having building work is never comfortable is it ‎<This message was edited>
[09/07/2025, 11:31:45] Peter Empson: The big thing in your favour is that the site was generating sales at a good ROAS. I appreciate that this was in part down to the pricing but you did seem to have the knack of sourcing desirable products that had a small amount of competition
[09/07/2025, 11:33:00] Peter Empson: Restarting the ads will not instantly get us back to where we were, the pause will have been damaging. I am all for taking it easy t start with, just like when we did it last time.
[09/07/2025, 11:33:24] Peter Empson: Good to see you’ve battled through it
[09/07/2025, 11:34:59] Sam Amdjadi: i’ll need to take a close look at our stock - we’ve quite a bit of stock that we have to get rid of. lets see what we can do. one option is to just utilise the small free traffic and targeted instagram sale events. But maybe there are other options like targets / small scale ads etc. be good to have a proper chat when the works are done
[09/07/2025, 11:40:56] Peter Empson: Look forward to it
[18/08/2025, 16:36:11] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, just checking in. Hope everything's all right with you guys. How's the building work going?
[01/09/2025, 10:32:56] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, the building work finished a couple of weeks ago and we’re dealing with the tidying up and moving of stocks to new locations which should finish in next two weeks. Thereafter our thoughts were to allow ordering on the site and see how things go before considering switching ads back on. Finances have been decimated
[01/09/2025, 10:33:58] Peter Empson: That's great news, it's nearly finished, Sam. I can imagine it has taken a big chunk out of any sort of profit that you had.

I'm here when you need me. Happy to have a chat.
[01/09/2025, 11:07:43] Sam Amdjadi: apart from all the building costs incurred, we had ordered lots of stocks which arrived and have had to be paid for. I’m not sure about any profits as such - these are all only on paper in a continually evolving stock business - but our cashflow is back to zero so we have to try and build that up
[10/09/2025, 08:17:50] Peter Empson: Morning Sam. I've just had an email to say that your feed management software on the website is due for renewal. The annual fee is $144.49, and it's my credit card that they have to charge it. Do you wish to continue with this or not? Please bear in mind that if we want to restart the ads at a future date, we'd have to rebuild the template for this.
[10/09/2025, 10:38:01] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, we are working hard towards reinstating ads in the next 2 weeks or so. Best to renew this please. Is there any scope in terms of how we engage - e.g. no charge for first 2-3 months until we build up cashflow again. If this isn’t possible, we could try this ourselves until sales build up and then engage you again. I’ve spoken to several of our suppliers about extended terms/support etc to allow us some further sku’s so that we can reluanch properly
[10/09/2025, 11:29:47] Peter Empson: Hi Sam,

I'll let them know you want to renew, and I'll send you an invoice for the subscription 

I can't work that long for free. The purpose of the Google Ads is to generate cash flow. I can do one month and then revert to the original rate we had. By this time, we should be generating some good levels of sales.
[15/09/2025, 11:55:40] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, i guess that could work if we can build up some cash behind us. Atm we are working towards getting ready to properly trade from Oct 1st. We may run a sale event to try and build some immediate cashflow and to support some existing overdue invoices. 

If we can get back to 1k a day quickly, then i think we will be able to stablise things and get back to a sustainable run rate. I’m using the opportunity atm to speak to shopify and the like with a view to migrate the site
[18/09/2025, 11:13:20] Sam Amdjadi: approx timeline: atm we’ve got a sale announced for the 8th Oct. That will take us 2-3 days to deal with. So perhaps Mon 13th would be a good date to restart ads
[18/09/2025, 11:23:20] Peter Empson: Great. How long is the sale on for?
[18/09/2025, 11:29:22] Sam Amdjadi: 3 hours 🙂
[18/09/2025, 11:29:45] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve organised couriers to start coming from 13th also
[18/09/2025, 11:30:51] Sam Amdjadi: we’re hoping there will be a big spike in traffic, activity on site, sales despite the loss, and momentum will help with a successful restart of ads
[18/09/2025, 11:31:57] Peter Empson: Okay, it's a shame I can't jump on that, but it's far too short a time span and is before your proposed start date on the ads 

Please don't expect a quick take of sales and profitability. The ads and the products have laid dormant for a number of months now, and it will take time to warm them up
[18/09/2025, 11:32:27] Peter Empson: I've already been looking at Merchant Centre making sure it's all set up correctly. There are a few issues with it which have now been resolved. I'll also take a look at the Google Ads well before the proposed launch date.
[18/09/2025, 11:36:17] Sam Amdjadi: Our intention is to hold steady and review after 30 days. That will tell us if we can make it sustainable. We’re doing things from our side such as sharpening up prices and so on. 

£500 a day sales would be a tight, £1k would be workable from my calculations (notwithstanding the profile of sales: products, margin on those etc). As i say, we want to do all we can and review after a month. The infrastructure here is better than before, and we’re a lot of learning behind us so lets see how it goes 🤞
‎[24/09/2025, 13:44:20] Peter Empson: ‎image omitted
[24/09/2025, 14:06:11] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, could you please complete the advertiser verification on the Google Ads website? You just need to log into Google Ads and click the menu item
[24/09/2025, 14:06:17] Peter Empson: That makes more sense!
[26/09/2025, 10:57:12] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, I strongly recommend that you do this as soon as possible as it may delay starting the ads up again as I’m not sure how long it takes Google to check the docs you upload
[26/09/2025, 11:08:26] Sam Amdjadi: Ok let me check
[26/09/2025, 11:09:05] Peter Empson: It just needs a few business documents, such as:
- Certificate of Incorporation
- VAT registration certificate
[28/09/2025, 11:17:12] Sam Amdjadi: companies house name is different so in the first instance, i have had to apply to change that
[28/09/2025, 11:17:26] Sam Amdjadi: thereafter i can supply those documents
[28/09/2025, 11:19:05] Peter Empson: Thanks for the update Sam
‎[29/09/2025, 12:46:04] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[29/09/2025, 12:48:18] Peter Empson: It should not be an issue, you can still trade as another company name. The only thing we won't be able to do is use the Godshot brand as the brand name in the ads, but that's not a big issue. I have a client for whom I advertise three different websites in the same Google Ads account. None of the names of those websites matches their company name.
[29/09/2025, 12:50:02] Sam Amdjadi: i uploaded our companies house docs etc but it did not accept. alternatively i can retain the name as it (Godshot studio) and upload documents to verify but that will say SamSan and i believe they may reject verification
[29/09/2025, 12:50:46] Peter Empson: They're just verifying the company name that owns the Google Ads account not the website that is being advertised
[29/09/2025, 12:51:11] Sam Amdjadi: let me know input the details and see what happens
[29/09/2025, 12:52:05] Peter Empson: Not sure what you mean here Sam? You are saying that you are going to verify the SamSan Limited name and see what happens?

[29/09/2025, 12:57:13] Peter Empson: Great stuff, we should know in a couple of days about whether its OK

[29/09/2025, 15:04:43] Peter Empson: Both can be editted
[29/09/2025, 15:04:58] Sam Amdjadi: i imagine its the later given its verified
[29/09/2025, 15:06:11] Sam Amdjadi: the latter cannot be changed without something showing Godshot studio > SamSan Ltd
[29/09/2025, 15:06:47] Sam Amdjadi: i may change who pays
[29/09/2025, 15:09:26] Peter Empson: Change account names in your manager account

[29/09/2025, 15:09:34] Peter Empson: I presume you've followed this, have you?
[29/09/2025, 15:09:47] Peter Empson: I'm afraid I've not actually done this before, so I'm not much help
[29/09/2025, 15:10:28] Peter Empson: The worst-case scenario is that we start up a new Google Ads account, but I can attach the old Merchant Centre account to it. It's the Merchant Centre account that will have the history of the performance of the products in it.
[29/09/2025, 15:10:56] Sam Amdjadi: its best we get to the bottom of this - i’ll need to dig around a little
[29/09/2025, 15:17:14] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve set up a new ‘payer’ and profile so lets see if this now works

[30/09/2025, 07:46:41] Peter Empson: Nice one Sam, you are now the leading expert!
[07/10/2025, 11:32:26] Peter Empson: Morning, Sam. Are we still on target for going live with the ads on the 13th?
[07/10/2025, 16:44:14] Sam Amdjadi: hey Peter, yep - very much so. its all systems go atm. we need a good sale event tomorrow night to bring in some cash to meet supplier payment plans obligations.
[09/10/2025, 14:33:42] Sam Amdjadi: in run up, we’re checking a lot of our pricing. I assume google feeds will take our sale prices? perhaps evern show original with slash: 

https://mygodshot.com/product/fellow-opus-conical-burr-grinder/
[09/10/2025, 14:35:18] Peter Empson: Yes, it may say ‘sale’ or ‘price drop’ as well.

The caveat is it hasn’t seen your live prices for a while so it may not take it as being a sale price. A sale price is where something has been reduced from a previously known price
[09/10/2025, 14:35:57] Sam Amdjadi: lets see how it goes. we want to ramp things up rather than sudden shock to the system
[09/10/2025, 14:36:22] Sam Amdjadi: this gives us a chance to steady ourselves operationally. we’re still coming to grips with ‘snagging’ such as courier issues etc
[09/10/2025, 14:36:30] Peter Empson: ok
[09/10/2025, 22:45:42] Sam Amdjadi: Let’s start ads Wednesday instead please. Sale event went well but the flip side is a huge dispatch operation
[09/10/2025, 22:46:11] Peter Empson: No problem
[09/10/2025, 22:46:18] Peter Empson: Glad it went well
[16/10/2025, 16:19:17] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, are we good to go with the ads?
[16/10/2025, 16:19:39] Sam Amdjadi: hi peter, lets do it
[16/10/2025, 16:20:12] Peter Empson: Great, enabling the campaigns now
[16/10/2025, 16:20:42] Peter Empson: £50/day to start?
[16/10/2025, 16:21:19] Peter Empson: When we paused, it was £170 per day
[16/10/2025, 16:22:11] Sam Amdjadi: ok lets start at 50
[16/10/2025, 16:22:29] Peter Empson: I'll keep you up to date with spend
[20/10/2025, 14:05:53] Peter Empson: Wow that was a quick start! 17 conversions since Thursday at a ROAS of 714%. 
So that's a cost of £186 and a revenue of £1300
[20/10/2025, 14:07:04] Sam Amdjadi: thats great - can you see the conversions are directly coming from the spend? it would be good for us to know whats repeat, and whats new. For example we received quite a few coffee order
[20/10/2025, 14:09:34] Peter Empson: They are the conversions that have been reported in Google Ads so they're sales that are directly attributable to that spend.

In Google Ads, you can't see what people have bought once they've come onto the site. You can see which shopping ads or which search ads have been clicked on, but not the actual products they bought
[20/10/2025, 14:14:47] Sam Amdjadi: ok - lets give it till 16 nov and see how its looking. We’re competing harder on pricing across key brands like kinto. It eats into margin but we have to get it to minimum £500 a day sales
[20/10/2025, 14:30:33] Peter Empson: I consider these to be exceptional figures, certainly in an e-commerce environment, I've not come across them before. Why are you putting a time limit on it if they are doing so well? i need to try and match your expectations here Sam could you share with me what you are expecting
[20/10/2025, 14:34:13] Sam Amdjadi: its not a time limit as such - its more of a lets analyse after a sustained period. The other key issue is stock. Sales need stock, and stock needs cash and availability. Its a time consuming and challenging arm of the operational layer needed to sustain a multi category website. This time of year, the 100’s of brands we work with, come under inventory strain so the challenge is particulary felt. Anyway, its a good start!
[20/10/2025, 14:35:55] Peter Empson: The great thing with Google Ads is that they don't ask for the money until you've received yours from the customer. This should help cash flow somewhat.

It's interesting to see some completely different products are firing off this time around and they seem to have taken hold very very quickly.
[20/10/2025, 14:36:58] Sam Amdjadi: we’ve lost Fellow somewhat - change of distribution and margin fractured - but i am working on seeing if we can get a workable deal from their new uk distributor
[26/10/2025, 09:56:59] Peter Empson: Hi Sam,

There is flexibility in the budget to go from £50 a day to £64 a day and still keep the same ROAS as we currently are. The target ROAS is 700, and we've actually achieved 1000 since the campaigns were switched back on again, which is incredible. Things are really going to start ramping up now, so we need to look at what this budget can stretch to. It's certainly producing a return for you.
[26/10/2025, 14:19:58] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, ok lets do it. 

i’m conscious that there is a dance here that needs to be managed closely: sales > stocks > cash > ops. Atm you only have visibility of sales. 

Ops can be managed by throwing more at it and breaking ourselves physically, but stock isn’t always as easy due to differing lead times, and cash can yo yo depending on mix of sales. For example many suppliers have moq’s and upfront payment terms. So we may buy 3k of stock and only a portion of is fast selling. Do this for 10 brands and suddenly £20 of cash is locked up etc. I’m only sharing this with you so you are aware of our constraints. 

But we share the same goal: grow sales as fast and profitability as possible. Internally we have another goal: create a sustainable environment for growth. We want to get sales to at least 1k a day with a minimum profitability that allows us to hire someone and reinvest into stocks which allows us to grow again. We don’t want to switch off ads again.
[26/10/2025, 14:21:23] Peter Empson: I anticipate I will be back to you cap in hand at the end of next week if not sooner
[03/11/2025, 15:43:44] Peter Empson: Hi Sam, current budget is £64 a day. Recommended budget is £190 a day. In the last seven days, we've hit a ROAS of 1,337% which is enormous. We've not really hit the start of Q4 peak yet, and we're hitting these numbers. In the past seven days, the spend has gone up by 25%, and the conversion value by 38%. I would strongly suggest we increase the budget.
[03/11/2025, 21:04:26] Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, my concern atm is our stock position. We have around 15 new orders outstanding that will trickle in during the next fortnight. I assume an increased budget will focus only on clicks that result in sales. I.e. therefore o/s items are unaffected
[03/11/2025, 21:05:11] Peter Empson: If an item is out of stock it will not be shown in an advert
[03/11/2025, 21:06:37] Sam Amdjadi: then lets pump up the volume and see what the next 7 days brings
[03/11/2025, 21:06:43] Sam Amdjadi: now you put that cap away!
[03/11/2025, 21:08:08] Peter Empson: We’re swinging onto peak now and your products are in demand, I’m sure the spend will need to be increased again very soon ‎<This message was edited>
[04/11/2025, 11:34:41] Sam Amdjadi: unfortunately it looks like someone is attacking our checkout this morning from the US. We’ve had 300+ failed orders
[04/11/2025, 11:35:00] Sam Amdjadi: i’ve had to switch off paypal. you any experience of this?
[04/11/2025, 12:26:04] Peter Empson: That's not great. Have you asked Shopify about it?
[04/11/2025, 12:26:28] Peter Empson: Is that your only payment method using PayPal, or do you have another payment provider?
[04/11/2025, 15:55:22] Sam Amdjadi: we use woocommerce and have other payment options so its not a problem on that front. its more the bandwidth issue and concern around security
[04/11/2025, 16:03:55] Peter Empson: Did you manage to get in touch with Shopify?
[04/11/2025, 16:04:38] Sam Amdjadi: yes but its a bit of a project to migrate and mirror the same design, and now not a good time. But they are probably better overall
[04/11/2025, 16:04:59] Peter Empson: OK
[06/11/2025, 12:28:29] Sam Amdjadi: less orders last 24 hours
[06/11/2025, 15:13:01] Peter Empson: Do you think it’s PayPal?
[06/11/2025, 15:16:51] Sam Amdjadi: doubt it but i have switched it back on earlier
[11/11/2025, 09:21:15] Peter Empson: Hi Sam Fellow is performing particularly badly. in particular, the grinder. If you feel as though we're not competitive with the product anymore, I could choose to not advertise it ‎<This message was edited>
[11/11/2025, 09:30:52] Peter Empson: To clarify the numbers: Over the last 2 weeks, Fellow Ode Grinder has cost £210 but only converted on 5 out of 11 days. When it does convert it's strong (1,200-2,000% return), but we had a 4-day stretch (Nov 4-7) where £82 was spent with zero sales. Other Fellow products (Opus Bundle, Corvo EKG) have spent £55 with nothing back at all. If you think pricing is the issue or it's just not worth the volatility heading into Q4, I can pause them and put that budget elsewhere. Let me know what you reckon.
[11/11/2025, 10:43:37] Sam Amdjadi: hi Peter, thanks for sharing this - yes let me have a look at pricing first but Fellow as a brand are one we are phasing out for a variety of reasons. Pricing, returns, cost of storage due to size and cost of shipping, with parcels often going ‘missing’
[11/11/2025, 19:19:34] Sam Amdjadi: Question: can we set headline price of a product say £90 but then offer a 10% discount voucher on the google ad?
[11/11/2025, 19:19:58] Peter Empson: Yes
‎[11/11/2025, 19:20:00] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[11/11/2025, 19:23:51] Peter Empson: It will say offer on it, you click the offer and the voucher is shown
[11/11/2025, 19:29:04] Sam Amdjadi: we’re coming into a bit of pressure from some brands to raise their pricing, so we’re thinking to do so but offer a discount code
[11/11/2025, 19:29:23] Peter Empson: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/11/2025, 19:30:17] Peter Empson: It’s a possibility but you can’t beat a low price
[11/11/2025, 19:31:05] Sam Amdjadi: true
[11/11/2025, 19:31:13] Sam Amdjadi: but at least this keeps us in the game!
[11/11/2025, 19:41:41] Peter Empson: I’ll need a list of products and details of the offer
[11/11/2025, 19:42:13] Sam Amdjadi: lets wait another week and see how it plays out here
[11/11/2025, 19:42:23] Sam Amdjadi: the main one is zoologist
[11/11/2025, 19:42:44] Sam Amdjadi: can we call it introductory offer?
[11/11/2025, 19:49:12] Sam Amdjadi: want to hear more good news?
[11/11/2025, 19:49:34] Sam Amdjadi: someone has been copying all of our fragrances and is opening a store not far away this week 🙂
[11/11/2025, 19:55:22] Peter Empson: That’s not great, we’ll need to sell more online!
[11/11/2025, 20:00:08] Sam Amdjadi: 3 lines of attack although we’ve been caught on the back foot: 

1. Bring in new brands and tie them to exclusivity 
2. ⁠Agree exclusivity with any existing brands we can 
2. ⁠Sell more online
[11/11/2025, 20:00:55] Peter Empson: I’m up for 2.2
[11/11/2025, 20:02:33] Sam Amdjadi: I also forgot:

2. Move on from some brands
‎[12/11/2025, 12:27:24] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted

[12/11/2025, 12:27:58] Peter Empson: Well spotted. Thanks for letting me know.
[14/11/2025, 12:56:09] Sam Amdjadi: some atrocious pricing out there. The only model we’re the best price on is the Aiden. Everything else is slashed. So best to stop ads

[14/11/2025, 15:59:18] Peter Empson: Can you confirm you want all ads stopping for the Fellow brand

[16/11/2025, 21:07:21] Peter Empson: I’ve paused all product ads for Fellow, please confirm this is what you want
[16/11/2025, 21:08:23] Sam Amdjadi: missed this - if its not performing, thats its the way to go, although we do have stocks we want to clear out. Particularly the sizeable Aiden which we have best price in market for
[16/11/2025, 21:09:13] Peter Empson: So you'll not be able to clear the stocks if we switch the ads off.?
[16/11/2025, 21:10:00] Sam Amdjadi: so i guess we can’t display Aiden without others
[16/11/2025, 21:11:27] Peter Empson: We can do it if that's what you want.
[16/11/2025, 21:12:00] Sam Amdjadi: thats what i was hinting at 😉
[16/11/2025, 21:13:14] Peter Empson: I can’t work on hints Sam, I need decisions I’m afraid
[16/11/2025, 21:14:03] Sam Amdjadi: i thought this was pretty clear. Fellow = no, but Aiden = yes. I’ll be more blunt in future
[16/11/2025, 21:14:15] Peter Empson: Suits me!

[16/11/2025, 21:15:02] Peter Empson: We are now a month in from when this all started again, can I assume that we are now working to the same contractual terms as previously, where there is a management fee of £600 per month.
[16/11/2025, 21:15:40] Sam Amdjadi: yes i think we hit our min target, but it would be great if you could send me link to dashboard to check figures / data etc
[16/11/2025, 21:16:49] Peter Empson: You are a user on Google Ads on your Gmail account.
[16/11/2025, 21:16:53] Peter Empson: sam.amdjadi@gmail.com
[16/11/2025, 21:25:32] Sam Amdjadi: so you turned off your little dashboard
[17/11/2025, 11:07:16] Sam Amdjadi: let me know if this is something we need to do from our side
[17/11/2025, 11:08:16] Peter Empson: Do you set shipping prices against products, or is it an overall shipping price?
[17/11/2025, 11:12:02] Zoe Godshot: Overall shipping prices but depends what’s in the order.
Orders containing only coffee = £2
Orders containing anything else up to a value of £100 = £3.99
Orders worth £100 or more = free
[17/11/2025, 11:13:43] Sam Amdjadi: Atm our coffee shipping price on on ads is incorrect and will be deterring buyers
[17/11/2025, 11:18:21] Peter Empson: I'm not sure whether Merchant Centre actually allows this sort of pricing, where it changes the shipping price if there is a specific product within the basket.
[17/11/2025, 11:18:32] Peter Empson: I've never come across it before.
[17/11/2025, 11:18:40] Peter Empson: I'll check it out.
[17/11/2025, 11:19:15] Sam Amdjadi: lets try to keep it simple for now and just show £2 if we’re advertising any coffees on google
[17/11/2025, 11:19:50] Peter Empson: Yeah, it's not that straightforward. It's all been driven by Google Merchant Centre, or it comes through against the product. I need to look at how it's working.
[17/11/2025, 11:22:01] Zoe Godshot: We’ve no option to set a shipping price per product, but is there something else we can do on the website?
[17/11/2025, 11:22:45] Peter Empson: Nothing that would affect the shopping ads. Let me just check on it
‎[17/11/2025, 11:35:04] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[17/11/2025, 14:03:47] Peter Empson: The latest shipping price you can see on there for the £200 product is picking up something that's set up in Merchant Centre for free delivery over £99.99.
[17/11/2025, 14:06:49] Peter Empson: I've set up a delivery type for coffee beans. These will have a delivery charge of £2, which will appear in the adverts. If you want to see the product IDs it applies to, I've shared them with you in a Google Sheet
[17/11/2025, 14:09:10] Peter Empson: It might take a while for this still a recharge to get through the system, so you might not see it on the ad straight away. I will check tomorrow.
[18/11/2025, 09:37:44] Sam Amdjadi: great - reflected on google and i think already a little lift in sales
[18/11/2025, 09:39:46] Sam Amdjadi: lets go ahead with this please as our sales on this completely dried up

on all Zoologist fragrance: 
https://mygodshot.com/zoologist/

15% off using code *15OFF* - we’ve already added it to every page

[18/11/2025, 14:50:10] Sam Amdjadi: Thanks - lets see if sales resuscitate
[18/11/2025, 14:53:55] Sam Amdjadi: there are two european sellers undercutting uk pricing. We’ve complained to the brand who have made this ridiculous reply: 

We have informed them and they said they would update the price. Bloom and slick boys have been selling at regular price for a while and they have never mentioned about them.
[18/11/2025, 14:54:10] Sam Amdjadi: if they don’t increased their price very soon, we will simply match them
[18/11/2025, 14:54:41] Peter Empson: Sounds fair enough.
‎[18/11/2025, 14:56:39] Sam Amdjadi: ‎image omitted
[18/11/2025, 15:00:57] Peter Empson: Putting the code on is a good response to this. I'll keep you informed of how it goes.
[18/11/2025, 15:02:09] Sam Amdjadi: great - if no imporvement in a day or two, we’ll just have to drop pricing and remove code
[19/11/2025, 11:26:20] Sam Amdjadi: we immediately got a sale overnight 🙂

Is the Strawberry Kiss one a new one?
[19/11/2025, 12:18:56] Zoe Godshot: The range changes frequently, so products go inactive and then active again. We usually have 10-20 active at any one time, but probably more than 100 different coffees with new ones added from time to time
[19/11/2025, 12:21:32] Peter Empson: The system uses a field called shipping label to denote the £2 delivery charge. I have to set this manually, but is there anywhere within your system where you can see shipping label? If not, can you give me a list of all the product IDs that this would apply to? Long-term, I'd like to set up a different product feed, but there's no time before Christmas to do that.
[19/11/2025, 12:35:01] Peter Empson: Quick update on peak season performance (Nov 1-19):

Current numbers:
• £3,081 spent → £19,751 revenue
• 641% ROAS (£6.41 per £1)
• £162/day average spend
• 287 sales at £10.73 each

You've already scaled 5.8x from October (was £28/day) and ROAS is still strong at 641%.

Budget's hitting limits most days. With Fake Friday this Friday (22nd) and Black Friday next Friday (29th), we need overhead on the spend or we'll be limited during the biggest sales days.

Recommend increasing to at least £300/day through peak - should maintain 500%+ ROAS based on current demand.

Worth pushing to capture full Black Friday opportunity?
[20/11/2025, 10:39:26] Peter Empson: Is this something you want me to go ahead with?
