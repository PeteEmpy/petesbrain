I've identified the cause of the click spike on October 27-28. **What  
Happened:** Your campaigns saw a 316% click increase, with one product (The  
Olive Tree Gift - £28.99, Product ID 01090) accounting for 1,465 clicks on  
October 28th alone. **Root Cause:** Product 01090 has been flickering in  
and out of your Google Merchant Center feed multiple times per day since  
October 25th. The product was removed and re-added 4 times on October 29th  
alone. **Why This Matters:** When a product is repeatedly removed and  
re-added, Google's algorithm treats it as "new inventory" each time and  
gives it priority in auctions. This caused the massive click surge.  
**Likely Cause:** This flickering typically indicates stock synchronization  
issues - the product is likely going in/out of stock rapidly in your  
inventory system. **Next Steps:** 1. Check your stock levels for product  
01090 2. Review your Merchant Center feed for any disapproval warnings 3.  
Ensure consistent stock availability for this high-performer The product is  
currently active at £28.99 and clearly performs well when stable. I've now  
enabled enhanced tracking to catch these issues immediately going forward.  
Let me know if you'd like me to investigate further.
