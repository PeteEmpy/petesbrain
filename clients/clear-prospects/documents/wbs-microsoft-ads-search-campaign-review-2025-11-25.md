|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **ROAS** | 671% | 400-600% (conservative estimate) |

| **Seasonality** | Strong winter performance | Aligned with chilly season demand |
| **Profitability** | £4,393 profit (YTD) | Additional profit opportunity |

## Key Metrics to Monitor

Once campaign is live, track:

1. **Spend vs Baseline**
   - Compare to Google Ads H&S PMAX spend levels
   - Monitor budget utilization rate

2. **ROAS vs Benchmarks**
   - Target: Maintain >400% (WBS brand campaign at 671%)
   - Compare: Google Ads H&S PMAX currently at 96%

3. **Impression Share**
   - Track Lost IS (Budget) to identify growth opportunities
   - Monitor Lost IS (Rank) for bidding optimization

4. **Search Query Quality**
   - Review search terms for wheat bag relevance
   - Identify negative keyword opportunities
   - Check for brand vs generic mix

5. **Conversion Performance**
   - Conversion rate vs Google Ads equivalent
   - Cost per conversion
   - Revenue per conversion

---

## Success Criteria

**Short-term (First 30 days):**
- Campaign spending consistently (>80% budget utilization)
- ROAS >200% (breakeven threshold)
- Search queries show relevant wheat bag intent

**Medium-term (90 days):**
- ROAS >400% (sustainable profitability)
- Outperforms Google Ads H&S PMAX baseline (96%)
- Incremental revenue vs brand campaign alone

**Long-term (Seasonal assessment):**
- Maintains WBS platform advantage (Microsoft > Google)
- Scales profitably through winter season
- Becomes permanent fixture in 2026 strategy

---

## Risk Factors

1. **Small Sample Size**
   - Only 12 months of Microsoft Ads data (seasonal account)
   - Brand campaign success may not translate to search

2. **Search Volume Limitations**
   - Wheat bags = niche product category
   - May hit natural search volume ceiling quickly

3. **Google Ads Baseline Low**
   - H&S PMAX at 96% ROAS suggests feed/pricing issues
   - Same issues may affect Microsoft performance

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Campaign Launch)
1. ✅ Set conservative initial budget (£50-100/day)
2. ✅ Mirror successful brand campaign targeting (UK focused)
3. ✅ Import negative keywords from Google Ads
4. ✅ Enable auto-bidding with ROAS target (~400%)

### Week 1-2 (Monitoring Phase)
1. Daily spend/ROAS checks
2. Search term review every 2-3 days
3. Document any platform-specific differences vs Google

### Month 1 Review
1. Compare cumulative performance to brand campaign
2. Analyze search term patterns (branded vs generic)
3. Identify scale opportunities (Lost IS Budget)
4. Decide: Scale up, maintain, or pause
