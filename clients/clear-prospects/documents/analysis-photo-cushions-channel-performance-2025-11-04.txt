PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: Face Masks vs Photo Cushions
==============================================================================

FACE MASKS (Nov 2025 analysis):
- Search campaign: 142% ROAS average
- Shopping campaigns: 44% ROAS average
- Action: Added [personalised face masks] as negative to Shopping
- Reason: Search massively outperforms Shopping

PHOTO CUSHIONS (Today's analysis):
- Search campaign: 171% ROAS (only one term "face cushion")
- Shopping campaigns: 146-346% ROAS across multiple terms
- Action: NO negatives needed
- Reason: Shopping outperforms or matches Search across the board

==============================================================================
WHY THE DIFFERENCE?
==============================================================================

Face Masks:
- High customisation intent ("personalised", "photo masks")
- Users want to see SPECIFIC features (upload photo, preview, etc)
- Search ads allow detailed benefit messaging
- Shopping images alone don't convey customisation process

Photo Cushions:
- Visual product - image quality matters more
- Users want to SEE the product (cushion with photos on it)
- Shopping format (product image + price) is ideal
- Less about process, more about end result

==============================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
==============================================================================

DO NOT add cushion terms as negatives to Shopping campaigns.

The current setup is working:
- Shopping campaigns handle most cushion traffic efficiently
- The one Search campaign we tested ("face cushion") underperforms Shopping
- Consider PAUSING the Search campaign or lowering its budget

Alternative: If you want Search campaign, test these angles:
- "cushion with photo of loved one" (emotional)
- "memorial cushion personalised" (specific use case)
- Terms where customisation PROCESS matters vs just seeing product

But based on data, Shopping is the right primary channel for cushions.

==============================================================================
FOR SEO/CONTENT STRATEGY
==============================================================================

Focus on visual content and product variety:
1. Product gallery showcasing different cushion styles
2. Customer photo examples (real cushions with photos printed)
3. Use case imagery (pet cushions, family cushions, memorial cushions)
4. Clear product images showing print quality
5. Easy upload process (same as face masks guidance)

The SEO content should support Shopping performance, not compete with it.
