## 🔵 Phase 5: Performance Trends & Quality Signals

### Quality Score Indicators (CTR as Proxy)

**High CTR Keywords** (>15% CTR) - Strong ad relevance:

| Keyword | CTR | ROAS | Implication |
|---------|-----|------|-------------|
| heated wheat bag for neck | 13.95% | 0.87x | Good relevance, poor landing page conversion |
| wheat bags for microwave | 12.83% | 0.65x | Good relevance, poor offer/price match |
| wheat eye mask | 17.20% | 3.87x | ✅ **PERFECT** - High relevance + high conversion |
| cherry stone pillow | 16.33% | 1.56x | ✅ Good relevance + acceptable conversion |

**Low CTR Keywords** (<2% CTR) - Poor ad relevance or low search intent:

| Keyword | CTR | ROAS | Action |
|---------|-----|------|--------|
| hot eye mask | 3.52% | 0.87x | Consider ad copy refresh |
| heat pads | 5.19% | 0.54x | Generic query - consider pausing |
| microwave heat pad | 4.45% | 0.89x | Ad relevance issue - test new ad |

**Recommendations**:
1. **Test new ad variations** for low-CTR keywords with decent ROAS potential
2. **Landing page optimization** for high-CTR, low-conversion keywords
3. **Monitor Quality Score** indicators (CTR, expected CTR, ad relevance, landing page experience)

---

### Competitive Pressure Indicators

**CPC Increases** (keywords with above-average CPC):

| Keyword | Avg CPC | Spend | ROAS | Implication |
|---------|---------|-------|------|-------------|
| wheat bags for pain relief | £0.52 | £39.38 | 0.73x | Low intent query - high competition |
| wheatbags uk | £0.72 | £38.18 | 0.03x | Competitive intent query - poor landing page |
| wheat bag company | £0.59 | £27.78 | 0.26x | Competitor brand - defensive bidding |

**Audit completed**: 16 December 2025
**Framework Applied**: Google Ads Performance Framework (Sections 5.6-5.7) + ROK Profit Metrics Methodology
**Methodology**: 5-Phase Keyword Audit (Waste Analysis, Growth Opportunities, Match Type Optimization, Search Term Analysis, Performance Trends)

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Data Quality**:
- All data pulled from Google Ads API via MCP
- 30-day analysis period (16 Nov - 15 Dec 2025)
- Keywords with spend <£10 excluded to reduce noise
- 83 of 100+ total keywords analyzed (top spenders)

**Profit Calculation**:
- Michael provides "Margin" data (revenue minus product costs), NOT gross revenue
- Profit = Margin - Ad Spend (not Revenue - Ad Spend)
- Generic Search profit margin (17%) vs account blended margin (28%)

**Strategic Context**:
- WheatyBags uses Product Hero framework for PMax/Shopping (not applicable to Search)
- Generic Search underperformance is a **keyword optimization issue**, not a Product Hero issue
- Search campaigns are keyword-driven and don't interact with Product Hero labels
