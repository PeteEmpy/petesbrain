## 💡 Growth Opportunities Identified (Low Priority)

Not urgent, but documented for future optimization:

1. **Add 7 high-ROAS search terms as exact match keywords** (20-30% volume increase potential)
2. **Test BMPM brand campaign** (no brand campaign currently exists)
3. **Increase brand campaign budgets** (WBS/HSG brand terms at 251% ROAS, limited by daily budget)
4. **Add negative**: "amazon wheatybags" (2% ROAS competitor traffic)

**Review these**: Q1 2026 planning

**Notes**: All high-impact items for week of 16th December 2025 have been actioned. Tier 1 negatives can wait until next week as they represent moderate ongoing waste, not crisis-level spend like the BMPM branded cushions keyword.
