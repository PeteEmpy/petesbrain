### 5. Opportunity: Search Terms → Exact Match Keywords

**High-performing search terms NOT yet exact match keywords**:

These terms are converting well as broad/phrase matches - add as exact match to control and scale:

1. **"wheatybags uk"** (£208 spend, 322% ROAS) - geographic brand variant
2. **"personalised masks with your face"** (£27 spend, 422% ROAS) - ultra-specific winner

5. **"face cushion"** (£28 spend, 333% ROAS) - alternative product naming
6. **"microwave hot water bottle"** (£23 spend, 279% ROAS) - hybrid product search
7. **"wheat bags microwave"** (£35 spend, 170% ROAS) - specification search

**Expected Impact**: Better control over bids, higher impression share on winning terms, potential 20-30% volume increase

---

### 6. Low ROAS Converting Terms (Marginal Performance)

**Terms converting but below 100% ROAS** - monitor for profitability:

| Search Term | Spend | ROAS | Action |
|-------------|-------|------|--------|
| wheat heat pack | £49.91 | 24% | ⚠️ Consider pausing if continues |
| happy snap gifts reviews | £61.77 | 14% | ⚠️ Monitor - review intent |
| amazon wheatybags | £31.92 | 2% | 🔴 Add as negative (competitor traffic) |
| wheat pack | £13.97 | 17% | ⚠️ Monitor |

**Note**: These terms ARE converting, so removing them immediately risks false negatives. Monitor for another 30 days before action.

**Total waste identified**: £129.04 in last 14 days (**£278/month at current rate**)

**🚨 CRITICAL - BMPM branded cushions**: This keyword alone represents 35% of BMPM search spend with zero return. This is a crisis-level waste.

**Framework Check**: ✅ Keyword-level ROAS analysis complete (Framework 5.6)

### 2. 🔴 Tier 1 - High Confidence Negative Keywords (Immediate Action)

**Framework Reference**: Section 5.7 - Search Term Report Review

**Expected Impact**: £50.33/month waste reduction (60-day analysis period)
**Framework Check**: ✅ Irrelevant search term identification (Framework 5.7)

**Why These Are Waste**:
- "wheat bag company" - Users looking for the category/company name, not to buy

---

### 3. 🟡 Tier 2 - Medium Confidence Negative Keywords (Monitor Closely)

**Criteria**: 10-29 clicks, 0 conversions (60-day period)
**Statistical Confidence**: Moderate (1-4 clicks/day)
**False Positive Risk**: 10-20%
**Auto-Flag Date**: 24th December 2025 (7 days from analysis)

| Search Term | Campaign | Clicks | Spend | Daily Click Rate | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **cushions** | BMPM Search | 10 | £23.28 | 0.17 clicks/day | Monitor - too generic, BMPM struggling |
| face pillows | HSG Products | 16 | £14.08 | 0.27 clicks/day | Monitor - review in 7 days |
| wheat bag for neck and shoulders | WBS Wheat Bags | 24 | £13.61 | 0.40 clicks/day | Monitor - high intent but not converting |
| the wheatbag company | WBS Wheat Bags | 23 | £12.64 | 0.38 clicks/day | Monitor - competitor/brand research |

| wheat heat bag | WBS Wheat Bags | 20 | £12.08 | 0.33 clicks/day | Monitor - similar to "wheat bag" winner |
| large wheat bag | WBS Wheat Bags | 27 | £11.21 | 0.45 clicks/day | Monitor - size-specific, may convert seasonally |
| microwavable bean bag | WBS Wheat Bags | 15 | £10.47 | 0.25 clicks/day | Monitor - generic alternative product |

**Action**: Continue monitoring - system will auto-flag any terms reaching 30+ clicks with 0 conversions
**Next Review**: 24th December 2025
**Tracking System**: Tier 2 terms logged to `tier2_tracker.json` for automated monitoring

**⚠️ BMPM "cushions" Note**: This term is too generic and BMPM is already struggling with profitability (35-78% ROAS). Consider adding as negative if it reaches 15+ clicks with 0 conversions.

---

### 4. 🔵 Tier 3 - Insufficient Data (Continue Monitoring)

**Criteria**: <10 clicks (60-day period)
**Statistical Confidence**: Low (<1.5 clicks/day)
**Action Required**: None - insufficient data for decision

**Summary**: 11 search terms with <10 clicks identified (not shown in detail - insufficient statistical power)

**Note**: These terms may move to Tier 2 in next analysis period if click volume increases.

**Account Average ROAS**: ~150% (based on converting terms)
**Waste Threshold**: <105% ROAS (70% of account average)

| Keyword | Campaign | 14-Day ROAS | Issue | Possible Cause | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **branded cushions** | BMPM Search | **0%** | 0 conversions, £98 spend | Wrong audience/intent | **PAUSE IMMEDIATELY** |

## Match Type Analysis

### Framework Reference
Section 5.6 - Keyword Match Type Distribution & Performance

### Current Distribution (14-Day Period, ≥£20 spend keywords)

| Match Type | Keywords | Total Spend | Avg ROAS | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **EXACT** | 16 (53%) | £566 | **136%** | Solid performance, good control |
| **BROAD** | 11 (37%) | £467 | **155%** | Higher ROAS, includes strong brand terms |
| **PHRASE** | 3 (10%) | £62 | **254%** | Excellent ROAS, small sample size |

**Analysis**:
- **Broad match performing well** because most broad keywords are **brand terms** (wheatybags, happy snap gifts, happysnapgifts)
- **Exact match solid** for product-specific terms (wheat bag, face masks with photos on them, etc.)
- **Phrase match excellent** but small sample (microwavable bean bags, heat bags)

### Recommendations

1. **Brand terms**: Keep broad match - it's working (250%+ ROAS)
2. **Product terms**: Maintain exact match focus for control
3. **BMPM branded cushions**: This BROAD match keyword is the problem - too generic for B2B intent
4. **Phrase match**: Consider expanding - showing strong ROAS (254%)

**Framework Check**: ✅ Match type performance analysis by ROAS (Framework 5.6)

## Search Term Patterns

### Framework Reference
Section 5.7 - Search Term Intent Analysis

### Converting Search Term Themes (60-Day Period)

| Theme | Example Terms | Total Conversions | Avg ROAS | Status |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| **Brand + UK** | wheatybags uk, wheat bags uk, wheatbags uk | 60.31 | **267%** | ✅ Excellent - brand authority |
| **Brand Direct** | wheatybags, happysnapgifts, happy snap gifts | 121.43 | **255%** | ✅ Excellent - direct brand search |
| **Exact Product** | personalised face masks, wheat bag, face pillow | 103.72 | **153%** | ✅ Good - clear intent |
| **Heating/Pain Relief** | wheat bags for pain relief, microwave heating pad | 19.78 | **135%** | ✅ Profitable - health benefit angle |
| **Custom/Personalised** | personalised hot water bottles, custom hot water bottle | 21.32 | **125%** | ✅ Profitable - personalisation demand |

### Low CTR Queries (Relevance Issues)

**Queries with CTR < 5%** (indicating poor ad relevance):

| Search Term | CTR | Clicks | Conversions | Issue |
|-------------|-----|--------|-------------|-------|
| wheat bag | 7.5% | 572 | 33.06 | ✅ Fine - high volume search |
| wheat bags for pain relief | 11.5% | 119 | 7.61 | ✅ Fine - niche but relevant |
| microwave bean bag | 6.9% | 40 | 0.46 | ⚠️ Generic, low intent |

**Note**: Most search terms have healthy CTRs (10%+), indicating good ad relevance. No major ad copy issues identified.

**Framework Check**: ✅ Query-level CTR analysis complete (Framework 5.6)

---

### Irrelevant Query Themes

**Framework Reference**: Section 5.7 - Negative Keyword Theme Development

### Theme 1: Competitor/Company Name Research

**Pattern**: Users searching for company/category names, not buying intent
**Examples**:
- "wheat bag company" (47 clicks, 0 conv, £25.96)
- "the wheat bag company" (36 clicks, 0 conv, £19.00)
- "the wheatbag company" (23 clicks, 0 conv, £12.64)

**Action**: Add as exact match negatives:
- [wheat bag company]
- [the wheat bag company]
- [the wheatbag company]

---

### Theme 2: Too Generic / Wrong Product Category

**Pattern**: Generic terms attracting bargain hunters or wrong product seekers
**Examples**:
- "microwave heat pack" (51 clicks, 0 conv, £24.37) - generic heating product
- "cushions" (10 clicks, 0 conv, £23.28) - BMPM too generic
- "microwavable bean bag" (15 clicks, 0 conv, £10.47) - generic alternative

**Action**: Add as exact match negatives:
- [microwave heat pack]
- [cushions] (BMPM campaign only - too generic for B2B)

---

### Theme 3: Competitor Brand Research (Amazon)

**Pattern**: Users searching for WheatyBags on Amazon, not direct purchase intent
**Examples**:
- "wheatybags amazon" (21 clicks, 3.09 conv, £39.25) - actually converting!
- "amazon wheatybags" (4 clicks, 0.72 conv, £31.92) - some conversion

**Action**: **DO NOT ADD AS NEGATIVES** - these terms ARE converting despite looking like competitor research. ROAS is 69% (below target) but not waste. Monitor closely.

**Status**: 🚨 **CRISIS** - Campaign severely underperforming, major waste identified

**Performance Summary (14-day period)**:
- **Campaign ROAS**: ~37% (crisis level for B2B)
- **Main Keyword**: "branded cushions" (BROAD) = 0% ROAS, £98.36 waste in 14 days
- **Total Keywords Analysed**: 1 keyword (only one above £20 spend threshold)

**Key Findings**:
1. **"branded cushions" keyword is bleeding money**: £98.36 spend, 0 conversions in 14 days = £211/month waste rate
2. **BROAD match is the problem**: Too generic for B2B promotional products
3. **Campaign-level issue**: BMPM Search overall struggling (35-78% ROAS from CONTEXT.md)
4. **Tier 2 concern**: "cushions" (too generic), "printed cushions", "bench cushions" all 0 conversions

**Critical Recommendations**:
1. **🚨 PAUSE "branded cushions" keyword IMMEDIATELY** - stops £200+/month bleed
2. **Add "cushions" as negative** (EXACT match) - too generic for B2B
3. **Strategic question**: Is Search the right channel for BMPM?
   - B2B products may perform better in Performance Max or Display
   - Consider pausing BMPM Search entirely and focusing budget on Performance Max (currently £50/day with 70% target ROAS)
4. **Alternative approach**: If keeping Search, try:
   - Exact match only: [promotional cushions], [branded cushions uk], [corporate cushions]
   - Phrase match: "custom branded cushions", "promotional merchandise cushions"
   - Geographic targeting: UK only (if not already)

**Note from CONTEXT.md**: BMPM restructured in October 2025 - paused underperforming categories (branded mugs, coasters, napkins) and started cushions ad group Oct 21. The cushions campaign is clearly not working.

## Data Quality Notes

### Data Completeness
- ✅ **Keyword data**: 14-day period (3rd-16th Dec 2025) - complete
- ✅ **Search term data**: 60-day period (18th Oct - 16th Dec 2025) - complete for statistical significance
- ✅ **Minimum spend thresholds applied**:
  - Keywords: ≥£20 spend (14-day)
  - Search terms: ≥£10 spend (60-day)

### Known Limitations
- **Conversion lag**: Last 2-3 days may have incomplete conversion data
- **Small sample size**: Some keywords have low click volume (<50 clicks)
- **BMPM limited data**: Only 1 BMPM keyword met spend threshold
- **No Quality Score data**: Requires separate export from Google Ads UI

### Campaign Exclusions
- **Performance Max campaigns**: Excluded (not Search campaigns)
- **Shopping campaigns**: Excluded (not Search campaigns)
- **Paused campaigns**: Excluded via campaign.status = 'ENABLED' filter

### Currency Note
**CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY**: Michael (Clear Prospects) tracks **"Margin"** not "Revenue" in Google Ads conversion value. Margin = Revenue minus product costs. ROAS calculations in this report use Margin data, not gross revenue.
