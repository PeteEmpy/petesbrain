- **Strategy Implication**: Cannot assume strategies that work for mature Go Glean will work for building-phase Grain Guard

## Strategic Context

### **⭐ CORE STRATEGY: Product Hero Segmentation Framework**

**CRITICAL FOR AUDIT ANALYSIS**: Go Glean uses the **Product Hero label system** as its primary campaign segmentation strategy. This is NOT traditional product category segmentation.

**What This Means:**
- Campaigns are structured by **performance labels** (Heroes & Sidekicks, Zombies, Villains), not product types
- Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs labels to Google Merchant Center
- Campaign names "H&S&Z" and "Villains" refer to Product Hero performance tiers, not product categories
- This strategy is consistent across all Connor Heaps businesses (Go Glean, Grain Guard, Crowd Control)

**Analysis Implications:**
- Budget allocation should consider label-based performance patterns (Heroes typically outperform Villains)
- Campaign ROAS targets may differ by label tier (Heroes can sustain higher targets)
- Product movement between labels (Hero → Villain or vice versa) will shift campaign performance
- Traditional product category analysis may miss the performance-based segmentation logic

**Product Hero Label System Details:**
- **Heroes & Sidekicks**: Top-performing products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains**: Underperforming products that drain budget but have optimization potential
- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance
- **Pro Plan**: €30/month subscription active on this account

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Structure**: Performance Max and Shopping campaigns with **Product Hero label segmentation**
- **Bidding Strategy**: Target ROAS (230-280% range based on campaign names)
- **Key Focus Areas**: Product Hero label optimization (Heroes & Sidekicks & Zombies, Villains), Grout vs Non-Grout split

**Active Campaigns**:
1. "GOG | P Max | Non Grout H&S&Z 240 11/10" - PMax for non-grout products using Heroes & Sidekicks & Zombies themes
2. "GOG | Shopping | Catch All 310 280 8/9 230 15/9 260 23/9" - Shopping catch-all with frequent ROAS adjustments
3. "GOG | P Max Shopping | Villains 280 2/9 249 8/9 260 11/9 230 15/9 260 23/9" - PMax for Villains category

**Campaign Naming Analysis**:
- "GOG" = Go Glean (brand abbreviation)
- "Non Grout" = Products that aren't grout (implies grout is separate/main product line)
- "H&S&Z" = Heroes & Sidekicks & Zombies (Product Hero performance labels)
- "Villains" = Product Hero performance label (underperformers with optimization potential)
- "Catch All" = Broader product coverage
- Numbers (230, 240, 260, 280, 310) = Target ROAS percentages
- **ROAS Trend**: High targets (230-310%), suggesting good margins or premium products

**Product Hero Label System**:
- **Heroes & Sidekicks**: Top-performing products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains**: Underperforming products that drain budget but have potential for improvement
- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance
- Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs labels to Google Merchant Center
- Campaigns are structured around these labels to optimize budget allocation and bidding strategy

**Note**: Campaign names "Heroes & Sidekicks & Zombies" and "Villains" refer to Product Hero performance labels, not actual product categories. Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs these labels to Google Merchant Center for campaign segmentation.

**Consistent Product Hero Usage Across Connor's Businesses**:
- **Grain Guard**: Heroes & Sidekicks, Villains (wood care products)
- **Crowd Control (CCC UK)**: Heroes & Sidekicks, Villains, Zombies (safety equipment)
- **Go Glean**: Heroes & Sidekicks & Zombies, Villains (building materials)
- **Pattern**: Connor uses Product Hero label system consistently across all businesses for performance-based segmentation

### Why This Approach?
**Product Segmentation**: "Grout" vs "Non Grout" split suggests:
- Grout products are core/main business (likely tile grout, construction grout)
- Non-grout products are complementary lines
- Separate campaigns allow different ROAS targets and budgets

**Product Hero Label System**: Consistent with Connor's other businesses:
- Proven framework from Grain Guard and Crowd Control
- Allows product-level performance tracking
- Automatically classifies products based on performance data
- Enables strategic budget allocation toward top performers

**High ROAS Targets (230-310%)**: Much higher than Grain Guard (160%) or Crowd Control (170%):
- Suggests better margins on building materials
- Premium product positioning
- Strong market position or brand strength

### Goals & KPIs
**Primary Goal**: [TBD]
**Target ROAS**: 230-310% (very strong, highest of Connor's 3 businesses)
**Target CPA**: [TBD]
**Other KPIs**: [TBD]

**ROAS Comparison Across Connor's Businesses**:
- Go Glean: 230-310% ← Highest
- Grain Guard: 140-160%
- Crowd Control (not managed by Connor, but for reference): 170%

---

## Historical Performance Patterns

### Seasonality

**Strong Seasonal Pattern - Patio Grout**:
- **Summer Peak**: Patio grout drives excellent ROAS and revenue during summer months
- **Winter Decline**: Performance declines significantly outside summer season
- **Business Impact**: This is a key performance driver for the account
- **Strategic Consideration**: Seasonal budget allocation and ROAS target adjustments needed

**Potential Patterns** (construction/building materials):
- Spring/Summer construction season (March-September)
- DIY/renovation peaks (Spring, early Summer)
- Weather-dependent demand
- Trade/contractor ordering patterns

### Year-Over-Year Trends
[TBD]

### Known Anomalies
**Frequent ROAS Adjustments**: Both Shopping campaigns show multiple ROAS changes:
- Catch All: 310% → 280% → 230% → 260% (Sept adjustments)
- Villains: 280% → 249% → 260% → 230% → 260% (Sept adjustments)
- Pattern shows active testing and optimization

## Business Context

### Product/Service Details

**Core Products**: Grout and related building/construction materials

**Product Categories** (inferred from campaigns):
- **Grout Products**: [Main product line - separate campaign exists or paused]

- **Zombies**: Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance
