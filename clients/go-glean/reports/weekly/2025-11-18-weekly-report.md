## Critical Issues Identified

### 🚨 ISSUE 1: Search Campaign Pure Waste (P0 - URGENT)

**Campaign:** GOG | Search | Products 350 16/6 AI Max 26/6 300 1/8  230 15/9 260 23/9 240 3/10

**Problem:**
- **£50.40 spent** with **ZERO conversions** in last 7 days
- 65 clicks at £0.78 CPC
- Extremely high CTR (6.43%) suggests broad match or irrelevant queries
- Campaign name shows multiple target ROAS changes (suggests ongoing problems)

**Impact:** £50.40 wasted this week = **11% of total weekly spend** generating nothing

**Action Required:**
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Pause this campaign (prevent further waste)
2. Pull search query report to identify what queries are triggering ads
3. Likely issues: Broad match keywords attracting wrong traffic, or landing page/conversion tracking broken
4. Review campaign history - name suggests it's been problematic (multiple ROAS target changes)

**Expected Savings:** £200-220/month if paused

---

### ⚠️ ISSUE 2: Primary PMax Campaign Below Breakeven (P0)

**Campaign:** GOG | P Max | Non Grout H&S&Z 240 11/10

**Problem:**
- **122% ROAS** (losing £0.18 for every £1 spent if 100% margin)
- Consumes 60% of account budget (£275.68/week)
- 20 conversions but only £335 revenue vs £276 spend

**Impact:** If product margins <82%, this campaign is **losing money**

**Action Required:**
1. Verify product margins for "Non Grout H&S&Z" products
2. If margins >50%, need 200% ROAS minimum to be profitable
3. Check asset group performance within this campaign
4. Likely need to:
   - Increase target ROAS from 240% to 300%+
   - Or pause underperforming asset groups
   - Or reduce budget allocation

**Note:** Campaign name shows target ROAS 240 set on 11/10 (38 days ago) - may need adjustment

---

### ⭐ OPPORTUNITY: Villains Campaign Crushing It

**Campaign:** GOG | P Max Shopping | Villains 280 2/9 249 8/9 260 11/9 230 15/9 260 23/9 240 14/11

**Performance:**
- **640% ROAS** (best in account by far)
- £35.92 spend → £229.91 revenue
- 7 conversions at £5.13 CPA
- Only 8% of budget allocation

**Opportunity:**
- Currently spending £5/day
- At 640% ROAS, could profitably spend much more
- **Recommendation:** Increase budget by £20-30/day, monitor ROAS

**Expected Impact:** +£400-600/month revenue if ROAS maintains at 500%+

## Root Cause Diagnosis

### Why ROAS Dropped 29%

**Primary Causes:**

1. **Search Campaign Waste (30% of problem)**
   - £50 spent with 0 conversions
   - If paused, ROAS would be 175% instead of 156% (+19pp improvement)

2. **Primary PMax Underperformance (60% of problem)**
   - Main campaign (60% of spend) running at 122% ROAS
   - Dragging down overall account performance
   - Needs immediate optimization or budget reallocation

3. **Budget Misallocation (10% of problem)**
   - Best campaign (640% ROAS) gets only 8% of budget
   - Worst campaign (0% ROAS) gets 11% of budget
   - Mid-performer (122% ROAS) gets 60% of budget

**Mathematical Impact:**
- If Search campaign paused: +£50/week freed up
- If reallocated to Villains (640% ROAS): +£320/week revenue
- Net improvement: +£270/week revenue (+37% account ROAS)
