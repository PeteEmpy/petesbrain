## Key Findings & Issues

### 1. **Generic Brand Assets Are Weak**

**Current Headlines (Non Grout - Heroes):**
- ❌ "Buy GoGlean UK products" - Too generic, no value proposition
- ❌ "Shop GoGlean UK today" - Generic call-to-action only
- ❌ "GoGlean UK — GleanUK" - Brand repetition, no benefit
- ❌ "Commitment to quality" - Vague, unsubstantiated
- ✅ "In Stock & Ready To Ship" - Good urgency
- ❌ "Transform Your Home Today" - Hyperbolic, not specific
- ❌ "Shop Now At Unbeatable Prices" - Generic claim

**Problem:** These assets don't communicate WHAT GoGlean sells or WHY someone should buy.

---

### 2. **Product-Specific Assets Are MUCH Better**

**Composite Sink Cleaner Headlines (Best performing asset group):**
- ✅ "Revives Dull Discoloured Sinks" - Specific problem-solution
- ✅ "Stop White Haze Forever" - Addresses specific pain point
- ✅ "Easy 10-15 Min Application" - Practical benefit
- ✅ "For Granite, Quartz & Resin" - Material specificity
- ✅ "Food-safe and Non-toxic" - Safety reassurance

**Black Stone Restorer Headlines:**
- ✅ "Restore Dark Stone Surfaces" - Clear function
- ✅ "Protects surface" - Benefit-focused
- ✅ "Reviving and Safeguarding" - Dual benefit

**Why these work:** They speak directly to the user's problem and solution.

---

### 3. **Long Headlines Are Too Long/Wordy**

**Current:**
- "We've declared war on grime & we're winning. Join the revolution, clean by clean." (83 chars)
- "Ready to transform your home? Browse our complete range & find your perfect solution today" (91 chars)
- "Trusted by homeowners across the UK. Premium quality products that deliver every time." (87 chars)

**Problem:** These sound like marketing copy, not search ad headlines. They're fluffy and don't communicate specific product benefits.

---

### 4. **Descriptions Are Repetitive**

**Common descriptions used across multiple asset groups:**
- "We've declared war on grime & we're winning..." (appears 3x)
- "Professional results at home. Transform kitchens..." (appears 3x)
- "Go Glean Ltd, a premier UK provider..." (appears 3x)

**Problem:** Google's algorithm prefers variety. Repetition limits testing combinations.

---

## Optimization Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Generic Brand Asset Groups (Heroes, Sidekicks, Zombies)

**Current State:** Weak generic headlines that don't sell
**Target:** Product-category-specific headlines that convert

**Replace Weak Headlines With Product-Benefit Headlines:**

| Remove | Replace With |
|--------|--------------|
| "Buy GoGlean UK products" | "Stone & Tile Cleaning Experts" |
| "Shop GoGlean UK today" | "Professional Surface Restorers" |
| "Commitment to quality" | "Made In Britain Guarantee" |
| "Transform Your Home Today" | "Granite, Slate & Marble Cleaners" |
| "Shop Now At Unbeatable Prices" | "Seal, Restore & Protect Surfaces" |
| "Cleaning made brilliant" | "Remove Stubborn Stains Fast" |

**Rationale:** These communicate WHAT GoGlean sells (surface cleaners) and WHO it's for (people with stone/tile surfaces).

---

### Priority 2: Add Problem-Solving Headlines

**Problem-First Headlines (Add 5-7 of these):**
- "Faded Stone? Restore Original Colour"
- "Limescale On Your Composite Sink?"
- "Patio Lost Its Shine?"
- "Black Stone Looking Grey?"
- "Remove Oil Stains From Driveway"
- "Grout Discoloured & Dirty?"
- "Protect Stone From Water Damage"

**Why:** People search for PROBLEMS, not products. E.g., "how to clean limestone" not "limestone cleaner".

---

### Priority 3: Strengthen Long Headlines

**Replace Fluffy Copy With Specific Benefits:**

| Current (Weak) | Proposed (Strong) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "We've declared war on grime..." | "Water-Based Formulas Safe For All Stone Types - Limestone To Granite" |
| "Professional results at home..." | "Professional-Grade Products Used By Trade Experts - Now Available Direct" |
| "Ready to transform your home?" | "50+ Specialist Products For Every Hard Surface - Patios To Kitchen Worktops" |
| "Trusted by homeowners across UK..." | "5-Star Rated Products - Fast UK Delivery - In Stock & Ready To Ship" |

**Rationale:** Specific details build trust. Generic claims don't.

---

### Priority 4: Diversify Descriptions

**Current Problem:** Same 3 descriptions used everywhere

**Add Category-Specific Descriptions:**

**For Stone/Patio Products:**
- "Specialist stone cleaners, sealers & restorers for patios, driveways & natural stone. Water-based formulas. Made in Britain. Fast delivery."

**For Kitchen/Bathroom Products:**
- "Professional-grade cleaners for granite worktops, composite sinks & tiled surfaces. Food-safe formulas. Easy application. Lasting protection."

**For Outdoor/Driveway Products:**
- "Heavy-duty surface treatments for driveways, block paving & outdoor stone. Remove oil, algae & stubborn stains. Long-lasting seal."

**For Specialist Products (Grout, Sealant, etc.):**
- "Specialist products for grout restoration, sealant removal & surface protection. Professional results. Simple to use. UK manufactured."

---

## Asset Group Recommendations

### Asset Group 1: Non Grout - Heroes (Generic - Needs Most Work)

**Headline Changes:**
- Remove 7 weak headlines (listed above)
- Add 7 problem-solving + product-category headlines
- Keep: "In Stock & Ready To Ship" (working well)

**Long Headline Changes:**
- Replace 4 fluffy long headlines with specific benefit statements
- Keep: "Enhance and preserve surfaces with GoGlean UK"

**Description Changes:**
- Add 3 category-specific descriptions
- Remove 2 duplicates

---

### Asset Group 2: Composite Sink Cleaner - Heroes (KEEP AS-IS)

**Status:** ✅ Excellent assets - specific, benefit-focused, problem-solving
**Action:** Use this as the TEMPLATE for other asset groups
**No changes needed** - this is performing well

---

### Asset Group 3: Black Stone Restorer - Heroes (Minor Tweaks Only)

**Headline Changes:**
- Remove: "Reviving and Safeguarding" (too vague)
- Add: "Black Limestone & Slate Sealer"

**Otherwise:** Assets are strong - product-specific and benefit-focused

---

### Asset Group 4: Non Grout - Sidekicks (Same Issues As Heroes)

**Apply Same Fixes As Heroes Asset Group**

---

### Asset Group 5: Shopping - Zombies (Minimal Assets - Needs Expansion)

**Current:** Only 4 headlines, 3 long headlines, 1 description
**Required:** 15 headlines, 5 long headlines, 5 descriptions

**Action:** Replicate Heroes asset group structure with product-benefit headlines

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1 hour)

1. **Add 10 problem-solving headlines** to all generic asset groups:
   - "Faded Stone? Restore Original Colour"
   - "Limescale On Your Composite Sink?"
   - "Patio Lost Its Shine?"
   - "Black Stone Looking Grey?"
   - "Remove Oil Stains From Driveway"
   - "Grout Discoloured & Dirty?"
   - "Protect Stone From Water Damage"
   - "Granite Worktops Need Sealing?"
   - "Tile Grout Needs Refreshing?"
   - "Remove Algae From Patio Slabs"

2. **Add 3 category-specific long headlines** to each asset group

3. **Add 3 diversified descriptions** to each asset group

---

### Phase 2: Replace Weak Assets (1 hour)

1. **Remove weak generic headlines** from Heroes/Sidekicks/Zombies
2. **Replace with product-category headlines** (see recommendations)
3. **Monitor asset performance** in Google Ads Asset Report (7-14 days)

---

### Phase 3: Testing & Iteration (Ongoing)

1. **After 14 days:** Review Asset Report
   - Identify "Low" performing assets → remove
   - Identify "Good/Best" assets → replicate approach

2. **Test variations:**
   - Benefit-first vs Problem-first
   - Specific vs Broad product descriptions
   - UK/British messaging vs Generic

---

## Expected Impact

**Before:**
- Generic "Buy GoGlean" headlines don't differentiate
- Vague benefits don't address search intent
- Repetitive descriptions limit testing

**After:**
- Problem-solving headlines match search queries
- Specific product benefits build trust
- Diverse assets allow algorithm to optimize

**Estimated ROAS Improvement:** +20-40% over 60 days
**Why:** Better ad relevance → Higher CTR → Lower CPC → More conversions at same spend

---

## Next Steps

1. **Export Current Assets:** Create backup spreadsheet
2. **Draft New Assets:** Use recommendations above
3. **Get Approval:** Review with client if needed
4. **Implement Changes:** Add new assets via Google Ads UI or API
5. **Monitor Performance:** 14-day review cycle
