- 'Them: Hi, peter.'
- 'Me: Could you just bear me one second?'
- 'Them: Yeah, sure.'
- 'Me: Awful. Yeah. Okay? They''ve not played loads of them. They''ve gone bump, man.
  They''ve gone into admin, into administration. Not. A problem. All right. Cheers,
  adam. Bye. So sorry about that.'
- 'Them: No worries. How are you?'
- 'Me: I''m fine, thank you. I think you don''t want to see my happy, smiling face.'
- 'Them: Thank you so much.'
- 'Me: Then.'
- 'Them: Okay, perfect. I can see that. Okay, so I''m recording this call for training
  and quality purpose. I hope that''s okay with you.'
- 'Me: Yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: Perfect. Could you please confirm the last four digits for the Google Ads
  account id?'
- 'Me: This is for Glean, isn''t it? 3737.'
- 'Them: Perfect. Thank you so much for the confirmation of the Google Ads account
  id. So Peter, I believe you had a conversation with Rohan regarding Google Ads account.
  He must have informed you regarding the promotional code that we have for the Google
  Ads account.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Correct. Perfect. So before proceeding to that, I have few of the things
  that I want to ask for the business so that I can understand the business better.
  I hope that''s okay with you.'
- 'Me: Yep, no problem.'
- 'Them: Okay, so your particular company is a manufacturer of hard surface cleaner
  and treatment, and you also design innovative and effective products to enhance
  and preserve the hard service, correct?'
- 'Me: Well, you''ve described my client''s business. Yes, My business is a consultancy.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Your clients business. Okay. And what we are looking out is more of
  the sales and leads.'
- 'Me: Well, Sales is an ecom site.'
- 'Them: So basically, when we talk about this particular thing, that sales, any of
  the number that you want to mention, like how many sales did we get for the last
  month?'
- 'Me: Oh, I have no idea. Do we have to do this sort of detail? Can I just give you
  a bit of background to what I do?'
- 'Them: Yeah, please. Look. Please.'
- 'Me: I''ve done good guys for 25 years now I have calls like this. Pretty much every
  day for the 11 clients, which I have. The reason for taking the call, I''ll be very
  honest with you, is I just want the promo code. I don''t need any advice on the
  client whatsoever. They''re a smallish client. They rely on one product during summer.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Which is a grouting product. And during the winter, they''re going to just
  be ticking over. There''s not a lot they can do. It''s a relatively new account
  for me and for them.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- "Me: So we're still building it. It's still getting provenance. We're still learning.\
  \ And as far as very detailed advice on the way in which the campaigns are to work.\
  \ Personally, I don't think they're relevant at the moment. And my experience of\
  \ these sort of calls is that you can just go through the recommendations tab and\
  \ you're going to talk about demand you and you're going to talk about YouTube,\
  \ and I'm just not interested in that at all. I'm just very keen to get \xA3400\
  \ off the client's. Bill for the month. So I'm being honest with you. Please don't\
  \ take that personally."
- 'Them: No, no, no. I''m not taking that personally. Perfect. I don''t understand
  that. Because see, we have to do this, correct. Like to understand or to suggest
  you anything for the Google Ads account. We need to understand your business, correct?
  So that was just a basic ask that we need to complete before we go on any of the
  call, which is perfectly fine. If you''re saying that you have been answering these
  type of question from quite a long time, I really understand your presentation.'
- 'Me: I''ve not been answering those sort of questions because those sort of questions
  be answered just by looking at the Google Ads account. That''s data that you can
  see.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Then what I want from your end is
  to just share the screen for the Google Ads account so that I can just suggest you
  what steps we need to follow when we talk about the promotional code.'
- 'Me: Yep. Sure about them in second.'
- 'Them: Perfect. Perfect. And all the Google Ads like these campaigns we are running.
  So you have set up them with yourself.'
- 'Me: I''ve set them up. Yes.'
- 'Them: Okay, perfect. So I''ll just take few minutes to fetch the promotional code
  for the Google Ads account.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay. Allow me some moment. I''m just fetching it out.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I''m sending the code the same email. That is a peter e at Roksys co uk.
  Is that okay?'
- 'Me: Yes, that''s fine.'
- 'Them: O. Kay. Allow me a moment. I''ve just dropped an email to your particular
  email address. Let me know once you have received it, okay?'
- 'Me: Okay, I''ve got that.'
- 'Them: Now copy the code that I have provided in the bracket.'
- 'Me: Yep. Got that?'
- 'Them: Okay, now come to the Google Ads account. In the very left. Click on billing.
  Now click on that. Click on. Yeah. Can you see Promotions. Go there. Promotions.
  Okay, click on pass. Yeah. Perfect. Paste it here. Okay. Click on submit. Perfect.
  Now, what we have done, we have redeemed this particular promotional code. Now,
  can you see? It says complete for the requirements. Correct.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, now what you have to do. Go back to campaigns. So now we have redeemed
  it today. Okay, so now we have 30 days to particularly use this promotional code.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- "Them: So what you have to do in the 30 days you need to use at least \xA3400 so\
  \ that this particular \xA3400 that you have used it get back credited to the Google\
  \ Ads account."
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay? Now, the further requirement says that means that what we need to do.
  From these particular campaigns. I can see this gog pmax campaign. Correct. So,
  if you''ll see this particular campaign, have this conversion value of 101,766.
  Correct. So what we''ll do, we''ll not make any of the specific changes for the
  campaign. What we''ll do, we''ll just copy this campaign. Paste it again so that
  campaign would be eligible to use that particular promotional code in such a way
  that it is like. I''ll say it is using the budget, but via the promotional code.
  So it would treat the campaign as a very new campaign. And that particular new campaign
  would be using the promotional code.'
- 'Me: Right. Right.'
- 'Them: Okay, so just click on the checkbox in front of gogp Max campaign. Yeah.
  Click on edit copy.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Okay, now uncheck this Gogpack campaign. On the top, you would be able to
  see paste. Yeah. Okay, done. Yeah. Don''t select anything, just click on paste.
  You have selected. Pause new campaign.'
- 'Me: Yes. I just wanted to see what it''s going to do.'
- 'Them: Okay? You need to change the campaign status to all. Okay, can you see this?
  Where it is? It might have. Just wait. We just pasted this gog one correct.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Scroll down. Scroll down little bit. Okay. We have only these many campaigns.
  I believe it has not been pasted. Paste it once again. Yeah. And don''t select anything.
  Okay? Click on done. Click on page directly. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So the. The promotional code only applies to new campaigns, then?'
- 'Them: It''s not like that. It''s just to just activate the promotional code. We
  just need to kick start one of the campaign.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Yeah. I''ve never known a code like this.'
- 'Them: It''s still updating. Sorry.'
- 'Me: I''ve never known a code like this.'
- 'Them: Yeah, I believe this is for see to be various. This is for only few of the
  clients. I handle many of the accounts in a day. But this has been created to few
  of the clients. That Google thing, they should use it. So I''m not sure what cell
  eligibility criteria behind that, but it''s very new. This is a very new criteria.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Them: It''s still updating. I believe before this it was not pasted. That is why
  we were not able to see any of the new campaign.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: We have to wait until it gets updated. And as you already mentioned that
  you know that what recommendations you should apply for the account and from where
  you can check it. Right now the account is already at 86.1% and the week on week
  growth is also very good by 3% of the increase. Just maintain the same score or
  try to maintain a little high from what we have right now. Okay, what we can do,
  we can add few of the video is it in the Performance Max campaign so that we can
  expand our reach on YouTube as well.'
- 'Me: Okay? That''s easiest said, then.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Done.'
- 'Them: That is why we have not selected that. And one more is there is expand your
  reach with Google Search Partner. So it would include some of the websites, like
  Bench and more like that. So are we not doing that? Intentionally. We are not doing.
  That.'
- 'Me: No, traditionally they don''t produce the same level of roas as just the Google.
  Real estate, so I never. I never bother.'
- 'Them: Okay, so we have tried that in past. That is why we are stating this correct.'
- 'Me: Correct? Yes.'
- 'Them: Okay? Perfect. Then that is totally up to you.'
- 'Me: Is this worth refreshing?'
- 'Them: Can try it once. Either it will stop or it will paste. Otherwise we have
  to follow the same thing again. Still, only if the three campaigns try it once again.
  Okay, are we operating this over Safari or Chrome?'
- 'Me: Yeah, we got to. These two at the bottom here. So let me just get rid of that
  one.'
- 'Them: Are we having this particular thing? Over safari or chrome.'
- 'Me: This is chrome. It''s here. The. The new campaigns here.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Now. It''s here. Okay, activate this one. Click on.'
- 'Me: This is paul. System error.'
- 'Them: System error. Okay, just do it once again. Remove this one as well and then
  paste it once again. Yeah. Okay? Perfect. Now close. Yeah. Now paste. Perfect. Yeah,
  paste directly. Perfect. I think it''s updating a little slow.'
- 'Me: It says isn''t. That.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That is why we were not able to see the previous pasted campaigns,
  correct?'
- 'Me: Yeah, well, that''s these two here. There''s no hash one there, though.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Which is a bit weird.'
- 'Them: They would be a hash again now. So just wait until get pasted. Because previously
  I remember that we have not selected like pause the new campaign, correct? So I
  think it automatically got paused.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So we''ll just wait for it to get updated. Let''s see what happens. The status
  for the next the hashtag3campaign has not been updated for removed as well.'
- 'Me: That one.'
- 'Them: The last one? Yeah. This one.'
- 'Me: Oh, I see. It''s got the remove there, but as you say. It''s not.'
- 'Them: Okay? Refresh once. Let''s see what happens now. Yeah, it''s there. See,
  it''s in past eight again. Says system error. Okay.'
- 'Me: One. Yet.'
- 'Them: Click on view details. Yeah. Let''s see what''s happening. What''s the error?
  It says zero error. I believe we. We just need to provide this particular campaign
  some time. Because if you''ll see it says run date and time. Start it the three
  December but ended is not available. I believe there is an issue with that. Go back
  to the campaigns again. Or if you could just close this tab and again, open this
  particular Google Ads account, that would be great. System would be able to have
  this particular thing. Yeah. Okay? Now click on paste. Yeah. Taste. Now. We''ll
  wait until it get pasted, okay.'
- 'Me: So this says, pasting your campaigns there. He didn''t say that last time.
  He just says it''s. Oh, there we go. Right. Okay.'
- 'Them: No. It did. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Which is a bit slower.'
- 'Them: On the very start.'
- 'Me: This time.'
- 'Them: We missed out on these particular two campaigns that we removed. I think
  there were no system error before.'
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Or. Or we didn''t pay attention there. No worries. We''ll try to do it this
  way. Let''s see how much time it takes for this particular one. So specifically,
  we are running basically a shopping campaigns, like we want more of the people to
  buy. So how you are dealing with the people who are basically adding something to
  the cart but not making any of the purchase?'
- 'Me: Well, I presume P. Max will deal with a lot of that.'
- 'Them: Okay like remarketing thing you are doing with PMAX only.'
- 'Me: Well, P Max is a certain amount of remarketing anyway, doesn''t it? But I''ve
  got a remarketing asset group. There.'
- 'Them: Okay, so basically, I''ll just suggest one thing. Okay, this is up to you.
  What? You want to apply for the Google Ad account or not? So basically, like, the
  best campaign that we suggest for the remarketing thing is a display campaign. Because
  everything we see is a visual representation. Correct. So whenever we are seeing
  anything and we are adding to the cart, it is an image on our mind. So whenever
  we use this particular display remarketing campaign, that plays a very vital role
  in convincing the people who have already added something in the card and then making
  a purchase. So we always suggest. Like when we talk about the remarketing thing,
  we always and always go for a display remarketing campaign with a maximized conversion
  of the bidding strategy.'
- 'Me: So rather than rather that than a demand gen.'
- 'Them: Exactly. If you''re creating asset group, what you can do, you can just take
  out some of the budget from the existing campaign. Or if you want to put a new budget
  on the new campaign, you can just start like for the remarketing only you can start
  that particular display remarketing campaign there you can add the existing audience
  that we have. Correct. Once you add the existing audience there display campaign
  will do its work.'
- 'Me: So add it as a display count. I''ve not added a display campaign for years.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: I cannot see that. I think you have not write a display campaign yet. We
  are only running, I believe shopping and PMAX campaign, correct?'
- 'Me: No, I mean across all my clients, I''ve not run a display campaign. For years.
  You know, a pure display campaign. Which Targeting remarketing. So that''s that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: ''s. That''s a new concept for me. I don''t know. I''m not a great fan of display
  campaigns, but certainly for re marketing. It''s quite interesting.'
- 'Them: And as you in the start mentioned that you are just learning like you have
  so many things to do in this particular Google Ads account. That is why suggested
  up to you what you can do. You can have like you can have a research on the display
  remarketing campaign how it can work best for you. Correct? Because this is particularly
  yo and your client''s business. Whatever feels good for you guys, you can go ahead
  and do that. Just being in account manager align with the Rohan I have just think
  one thing to say. Because what''s the important part is how many people we are losing
  on a stage where they can really convert, but they are not converting.'
- 'Me: Right. I think the only, the only issue with a, with a remarketing campaign
  for, for this client is, is not having enough data.'
- 'Them: Correct.'
- 'Me: It''s. I don''t think there''s enough traffic running through the site to warrant
  a remarketing campaign. We can''t make the audience segments big enough.'
- 'Them: In the very left click on admin. Let''s see if we have turned that particular
  customer list things on in the Google Ads account. Okay, see, Conversion based list
  is on. Okay, now go to tools in the left. Okay, click on planning. Planning. Sorry.
  Click on shared library. Yeah. Audience manager. Okay, so basically, these all are
  the list. So can you see this? Shopify purchasers. We can target these people because
  this has a size that can be used for a campaign. And these all are the segments
  that system has created for you according to what people have been interacting with
  the website that you have.'
- 'Me: Well, I''ve created that. I''ve created that as a customer list.'
- 'Them: If you''ll see the segment type there, you can see how many you created and
  how many have been created automatically based on whatever data system is collected.
  Can you see the second column? It says segment type.'
- 'Me: Y.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So this one particularly you might have corrected, created the Shopify
  Purchasers, Shopify Basket Amenders. If you see the very first one download, that
  is a conversion base that is automatically created. Correct. The fourth one that
  says Begin checkout. So people who have clicked on Begin Checkout system is also
  trying to record the people who are clicking on begin checkout as well.'
- 'Me: Eah, I see what you mean. Yeah.'
- 'Them: So you can use these particular data while creating a display marketing campaign.
  Because this is the main thing that we need to do when we start a new campaign.
  Okay. And this is.'
- 'Me: So these are all less than a thousand size though, aren''t they?'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. But until. Unless it doesn''t say that too small to serve, we
  can still use them. So basically, they''re still populating. If you''ll see, on
  the very top it says size for every of the channel. Correct. So it will keep recording
  the data for the people. If it doesn''t say. Too small to serve. We can use that.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So you. So you''re actually. So you''re actually talking about creating a campaign?'
- 'Them: Take with us.'
- 'Me: Just for display, so we''re just going to use image assets for it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Image assets. And using those particular lists that you think particularly
  can retarget those people who are. I believe I''ll say that. Who are mostly likely
  to convert or make a purchase.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: So you can have a discussion with the client and then you can go ahead and
  do that. Okay. Can you see this has been eligible. Yeah. This one. So we will pause
  the previous one. That doesn''t have any of the hashtag go back the post one will
  pause. Yum.'
- 'Me: But are we not going to disrupt the algorithm if we pause that one?'
- "Them: Okay, so what is happening here? We have pasted the same campaign here. Okay?\
  \ It will not pause that. System would have an increase in budget of \xA340."
- 'Me: Right.'
- 'Them: Okay, because we have just pasted the same campaign there. So just to kickstart
  that particular, that particular promotional code that we have, we have pasted the
  same campaign without creating a new one, so that the campaign that is given is
  a good conversion value would start that. So if that''s okay with you, what we can
  do. We can keep both of the campaigns running for a while. Once this particular
  campaign, the hashtag2campaign is also good data, then you can pause the previous
  one.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Correct. So that you can also have a track either the coupon is being used
  or not.'
- 'Me: Right. I''m just. I''m just dubious of posing any campaign that''s been performing
  well and replacing it with another one.'
- 'Them: See, it''s not like that. We are replacing that. We have just copied and
  pasted the same campaign.'
- 'Me: Yes, we have done. But the history, the history, the diversion history of the
  campaign is against the campaign.'
- 'Them: Okay? We are talking about it. Whatever data the campaign, the previous campaign
  is collected, it might not be present in the new campaign, correct?'
- 'Me: Correct? Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay, so whenever we create a new campaign and the campaign is using any
  of the data, it''s not based on what we have provided. Previously. It is based on
  what audience we have linked to it and what of the data is using from the account.
  So you might have provided some of the audience to this particular campaign as well.
  Correct. When system in like 24 hours, when system sees that this particular campaign
  is same as the previous campaign and there are no changes on that, the audience
  will say the targeted segment is same. Then system do not put that particular campaign
  on a bid strategy learning for very long.'
- 'Me: Right, okay.'
- 'Them: Okay, so that is. I''m saying that just wait for. I''ll say just three to
  four days. You can see whatever. You can compare the performance in both of the
  campaign. The new campaign would give you same performance as the previous one was
  giving us.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So.'
- 'Them: So once.'
- "Me: So I was going to say that the, the, so the, the promotion of \xA3400 is only\
  \ going to kick in if it does actually spend \xA3400 in a 30 day period."
- 'Them: Could you please repeat that? I just missed it.'
- "Me: So the, the, the, the, the, the voucher code we've just put in will only work\
  \ if it spends \xA3400 in the next 30 days."
- "Them: Yeah. See, we have to make sure that our campaigns are particularly like\
  \ spending \xA3400 in next 30 days."
- 'Me: Yeah, okay.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah, fine. I. I mean, I actually don''t know is about that with it being
  over Christmas. Whether it. Whether it will actually do it or not, you can see that.'
- 'Them: Okay, let''s compare. Let''s put the date range for last 40 days. Fourteen
  days. Sorry. Go to the date range, put the data for last 14 days.'
- 'Me: 14.'
- 'Them: Take me to the cost scroll down. Take me to cost, okay? Column cost. Scroll
  to. Okay, if I see a total scroll down. Scroll down. Total search campaign. Okay.
  The total cost is 637. Okay. So I believe it''s very much doable. That campaign
  would be using 400,000 x 15 days only, correct?'
- 'Me: Yeah, well, we''ve got nothing to lose anyway, so.'
- "Them: Yeah, exactly. Because promotional code is has already been applied to the\
  \ account. So even if the campaign is spending \xA3400, that is something that Google\
  \ is providing you."
- 'Me: Yeah, I''m just going to pause that other one. There was another one just popped
  up there.'
- 'Them: Correct.'
- 'Me: That was. And we only want one of these, so I''ve just paused the other one.'
- 'Them: It''s only one hashtag 2 one that is eligible, rather than that you can see
  there, paused and removed.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I''ve just paused it. I''ve just paused that with all.'
- 'Them: The first one. The previous one or the new one?'
- 'Me: No. If you look at the bottom of that screen there, there was. There. There
  was two that had been pasted. And they were both. They were both unable. So it just
  paused the bottom ones. We''ve only got one copied, one that is actually enabled
  along with that.'
- 'Them: Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: We have done that. Okay. So perfect, Peter. So what we have done is we have
  applied the particular code in the Google Ads account. We have kick started a new
  campaign there with a new budget so that the campaign can use the previous data
  and give you that particular result as same as the previous campaign as well as
  use the promotional code.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay, second thing, I just want you to have a look over the optimization
  score as well. You already know everything about that, correct? So I''ll not give
  any of the extra knowledge to you regarding that. Okay. Just make sure that we are
  keeping that score above 90% because this generally shows us how well we have set
  our ads to perform, okay?'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: I do also have a look for a display remarketing campaign. Okay?'
- 'Me: I will.'
- 'Them: And anytime if you need help regarding the display remarketing campaign,
  any kind of help, you can always reach out to me via particularly email and I''ll
  be happy to schedule an appointment with you.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you very much.'
- 'Them: Okay? So what I''ll do? I''ll just ask Rohan to send you a follow up call
  for the 14th day so that we can see how the promotional code worked for us, how
  the new campaign worked for us for those particular 14 days. Do not make any of
  the further changes for the Google Ads account.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Yeah, no problem.'
- 'Them: And campaign can use twice of the daily budget anytime, but it would never
  exceed what we have on the monthly budget Part. Okay. Rohan will be sending you
  minutes of meeting of whatever we have discussed.'
- 'Me: Okay? Yeah.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Right. Okay. Yeah.'
- 'Them: And if you anytime face any kind of issue, you can always reach out to me
  via particularly email. Okay?'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Is there anything else? And I can answer?'
- 'Me: No, that''s fine. Thank you very much.'
- 'Them: Okay, perfect, then. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.'

- Them: Hi, peter.
- Me: Could you just bear me one second?
- Them: Yeah, sure.
- Me: Awful. Yeah. Okay? They've not played loads of them. They've gone bump, man. They've gone into admin, into administration. Not. A problem. All right. Cheers, adam. Bye. So sorry about that.
- Them: No worries. How are you?
- Me: I'm fine, thank you. I think you don't want to see my happy, smiling face.
- Them: Thank you so much.
- Me: Then.
- Them: Okay, perfect. I can see that. Okay, so I'm recording this call for training and quality purpose. I hope that's okay with you.
- Me: Yeah, no problem.
- Them: Perfect. Could you please confirm the last four digits for the Google Ads account id?
- Me: This is for Glean, isn't it? 3737.
- Them: Perfect. Thank you so much for the confirmation of the Google Ads account id. So Peter, I believe you had a conversation with Rohan regarding Google Ads account. He must have informed you regarding the promotional code that we have for the Google Ads account.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Correct. Perfect. So before proceeding to that, I have few of the things that I want to ask for the business so that I can understand the business better. I hope that's okay with you.
- Me: Yep, no problem.
- Them: Okay, so your particular company is a manufacturer of hard surface cleaner and treatment, and you also design innovative and effective products to enhance and preserve the hard service, correct?
- Me: Well, you've described my client's business. Yes, My business is a consultancy.
- Them: Yeah. Your clients business. Okay. And what we are looking out is more of the sales and leads.
- Me: Well, Sales is an ecom site.
- Them: So basically, when we talk about this particular thing, that sales, any of the number that you want to mention, like how many sales did we get for the last month?
- Me: Oh, I have no idea. Do we have to do this sort of detail? Can I just give you a bit of background to what I do?
- Them: Yeah, please. Look. Please.
- Me: I've done good guys for 25 years now I have calls like this. Pretty much every day for the 11 clients, which I have. The reason for taking the call, I'll be very honest with you, is I just want the promo code. I don't need any advice on the client whatsoever. They're a smallish client. They rely on one product during summer.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Which is a grouting product. And during the winter, they're going to just be ticking over. There's not a lot they can do. It's a relatively new account for me and for them.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So we're still building it. It's still getting provenance. We're still learning. And as far as very detailed advice on the way in which the campaigns are to work. Personally, I don't think they're relevant at the moment. And my experience of these sort of calls is that you can just go through the recommendations tab and you're going to talk about demand you and you're going to talk about YouTube, and I'm just not interested in that at all. I'm just very keen to get £400 off the client's. Bill for the month. So I'm being honest with you. Please don't take that personally.
- Them: No, no, no. I'm not taking that personally. Perfect. I don't understand that. Because see, we have to do this, correct. Like to understand or to suggest you anything for the Google Ads account. We need to understand your business, correct? So that was just a basic ask that we need to complete before we go on any of the call, which is perfectly fine. If you're saying that you have been answering these type of question from quite a long time, I really understand your presentation.
- Me: I've not been answering those sort of questions because those sort of questions be answered just by looking at the Google Ads account. That's data that you can see.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Then what I want from your end is to just share the screen for the Google Ads account so that I can just suggest you what steps we need to follow when we talk about the promotional code.
- Me: Yep. Sure about them in second.
- Them: Perfect. Perfect. And all the Google Ads like these campaigns we are running. So you have set up them with yourself.
- Me: I've set them up. Yes.
- Them: Okay, perfect. So I'll just take few minutes to fetch the promotional code for the Google Ads account.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Okay. Allow me some moment. I'm just fetching it out.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I'm sending the code the same email. That is a peter e at Roksys co uk. Is that okay?
- Me: Yes, that's fine.
- Them: O. Kay. Allow me a moment. I've just dropped an email to your particular email address. Let me know once you have received it, okay?
- Me: Okay, I've got that.
- Them: Now copy the code that I have provided in the bracket.
- Me: Yep. Got that?
- Them: Okay, now come to the Google Ads account. In the very left. Click on billing. Now click on that. Click on. Yeah. Can you see Promotions. Go there. Promotions. Okay, click on pass. Yeah. Perfect. Paste it here. Okay. Click on submit. Perfect. Now, what we have done, we have redeemed this particular promotional code. Now, can you see? It says complete for the requirements. Correct.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Okay, now what you have to do. Go back to campaigns. So now we have redeemed it today. Okay, so now we have 30 days to particularly use this promotional code.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: So what you have to do in the 30 days you need to use at least £400 so that this particular £400 that you have used it get back credited to the Google Ads account.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Okay? Now, the further requirement says that means that what we need to do. From these particular campaigns. I can see this gog pmax campaign. Correct. So, if you'll see this particular campaign, have this conversion value of 101,766. Correct. So what we'll do, we'll not make any of the specific changes for the campaign. What we'll do, we'll just copy this campaign. Paste it again so that campaign would be eligible to use that particular promotional code in such a way that it is like. I'll say it is using the budget, but via the promotional code. So it would treat the campaign as a very new campaign. And that particular new campaign would be using the promotional code.
- Me: Right. Right.
- Them: Okay, so just click on the checkbox in front of gogp Max campaign. Yeah. Click on edit copy.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Okay, now uncheck this Gogpack campaign. On the top, you would be able to see paste. Yeah. Okay, done. Yeah. Don't select anything, just click on paste. You have selected. Pause new campaign.
- Me: Yes. I just wanted to see what it's going to do.
- Them: Okay? You need to change the campaign status to all. Okay, can you see this? Where it is? It might have. Just wait. We just pasted this gog one correct.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Scroll down. Scroll down little bit. Okay. We have only these many campaigns. I believe it has not been pasted. Paste it once again. Yeah. And don't select anything. Okay? Click on done. Click on page directly. Yeah.
- Me: So the. The promotional code only applies to new campaigns, then?
- Them: It's not like that. It's just to just activate the promotional code. We just need to kick start one of the campaign.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Yeah. I've never known a code like this.
- Them: It's still updating. Sorry.
- Me: I've never known a code like this.
- Them: Yeah, I believe this is for see to be various. This is for only few of the clients. I handle many of the accounts in a day. But this has been created to few of the clients. That Google thing, they should use it. So I'm not sure what cell eligibility criteria behind that, but it's very new. This is a very new criteria.
- Me: Okay? Okay?
- Them: It's still updating. I believe before this it was not pasted. That is why we were not able to see any of the new campaign.
- Me: Right.
- Them: We have to wait until it gets updated. And as you already mentioned that you know that what recommendations you should apply for the account and from where you can check it. Right now the account is already at 86.1% and the week on week growth is also very good by 3% of the increase. Just maintain the same score or try to maintain a little high from what we have right now. Okay, what we can do, we can add few of the video is it in the Performance Max campaign so that we can expand our reach on YouTube as well.
- Me: Okay? That's easiest said, then.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Done.
- Them: That is why we have not selected that. And one more is there is expand your reach with Google Search Partner. So it would include some of the websites, like Bench and more like that. So are we not doing that? Intentionally. We are not doing. That.
- Me: No, traditionally they don't produce the same level of roas as just the Google. Real estate, so I never. I never bother.
- Them: Okay, so we have tried that in past. That is why we are stating this correct.
- Me: Correct? Yes.
- Them: Okay? Perfect. Then that is totally up to you.
- Me: Is this worth refreshing?
- Them: Can try it once. Either it will stop or it will paste. Otherwise we have to follow the same thing again. Still, only if the three campaigns try it once again. Okay, are we operating this over Safari or Chrome?
- Me: Yeah, we got to. These two at the bottom here. So let me just get rid of that one.
- Them: Are we having this particular thing? Over safari or chrome.
- Me: This is chrome. It's here. The. The new campaigns here.
- Them: Yeah. Now. It's here. Okay, activate this one. Click on.
- Me: This is paul. System error.
- Them: System error. Okay, just do it once again. Remove this one as well and then paste it once again. Yeah. Okay? Perfect. Now close. Yeah. Now paste. Perfect. Yeah, paste directly. Perfect. I think it's updating a little slow.
- Me: It says isn't. That.
- Them: Yeah. That is why we were not able to see the previous pasted campaigns, correct?
- Me: Yeah, well, that's these two here. There's no hash one there, though.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Me: Which is a bit weird.
- Them: They would be a hash again now. So just wait until get pasted. Because previously I remember that we have not selected like pause the new campaign, correct? So I think it automatically got paused.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So we'll just wait for it to get updated. Let's see what happens. The status for the next the hashtag3campaign has not been updated for removed as well.
- Me: That one.
- Them: The last one? Yeah. This one.
- Me: Oh, I see. It's got the remove there, but as you say. It's not.
- Them: Okay? Refresh once. Let's see what happens now. Yeah, it's there. See, it's in past eight again. Says system error. Okay.
- Me: One. Yet.
- Them: Click on view details. Yeah. Let's see what's happening. What's the error? It says zero error. I believe we. We just need to provide this particular campaign some time. Because if you'll see it says run date and time. Start it the three December but ended is not available. I believe there is an issue with that. Go back to the campaigns again. Or if you could just close this tab and again, open this particular Google Ads account, that would be great. System would be able to have this particular thing. Yeah. Okay? Now click on paste. Yeah. Taste. Now. We'll wait until it get pasted, okay.
- Me: So this says, pasting your campaigns there. He didn't say that last time. He just says it's. Oh, there we go. Right. Okay.
- Them: No. It did. Yeah.
- Me: Which is a bit slower.
- Them: On the very start.
- Me: This time.
- Them: We missed out on these particular two campaigns that we removed. I think there were no system error before.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Or. Or we didn't pay attention there. No worries. We'll try to do it this way. Let's see how much time it takes for this particular one. So specifically, we are running basically a shopping campaigns, like we want more of the people to buy. So how you are dealing with the people who are basically adding something to the cart but not making any of the purchase?
- Me: Well, I presume P. Max will deal with a lot of that.
- Them: Okay like remarketing thing you are doing with PMAX only.
- Me: Well, P Max is a certain amount of remarketing anyway, doesn't it? But I've got a remarketing asset group. There.
- Them: Okay, so basically, I'll just suggest one thing. Okay, this is up to you. What? You want to apply for the Google Ad account or not? So basically, like, the best campaign that we suggest for the remarketing thing is a display campaign. Because everything we see is a visual representation. Correct. So whenever we are seeing anything and we are adding to the cart, it is an image on our mind. So whenever we use this particular display remarketing campaign, that plays a very vital role in convincing the people who have already added something in the card and then making a purchase. So we always suggest. Like when we talk about the remarketing thing, we always and always go for a display remarketing campaign with a maximized conversion of the bidding strategy.
- Me: So rather than rather that than a demand gen.
- Them: Exactly. If you're creating asset group, what you can do, you can just take out some of the budget from the existing campaign. Or if you want to put a new budget on the new campaign, you can just start like for the remarketing only you can start that particular display remarketing campaign there you can add the existing audience that we have. Correct. Once you add the existing audience there display campaign will do its work.
- Me: So add it as a display count. I've not added a display campaign for years.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: I cannot see that. I think you have not write a display campaign yet. We are only running, I believe shopping and PMAX campaign, correct?
- Me: No, I mean across all my clients, I've not run a display campaign. For years. You know, a pure display campaign. Which Targeting remarketing. So that's that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: 's. That's a new concept for me. I don't know. I'm not a great fan of display campaigns, but certainly for re marketing. It's quite interesting.
- Them: And as you in the start mentioned that you are just learning like you have so many things to do in this particular Google Ads account. That is why suggested up to you what you can do. You can have like you can have a research on the display remarketing campaign how it can work best for you. Correct? Because this is particularly yo and your client's business. Whatever feels good for you guys, you can go ahead and do that. Just being in account manager align with the Rohan I have just think one thing to say. Because what's the important part is how many people we are losing on a stage where they can really convert, but they are not converting.
- Me: Right. I think the only, the only issue with a, with a remarketing campaign for, for this client is, is not having enough data.
- Them: Correct.
- Me: It's. I don't think there's enough traffic running through the site to warrant a remarketing campaign. We can't make the audience segments big enough.
- Them: In the very left click on admin. Let's see if we have turned that particular customer list things on in the Google Ads account. Okay, see, Conversion based list is on. Okay, now go to tools in the left. Okay, click on planning. Planning. Sorry. Click on shared library. Yeah. Audience manager. Okay, so basically, these all are the list. So can you see this? Shopify purchasers. We can target these people because this has a size that can be used for a campaign. And these all are the segments that system has created for you according to what people have been interacting with the website that you have.
- Me: Well, I've created that. I've created that as a customer list.
- Them: If you'll see the segment type there, you can see how many you created and how many have been created automatically based on whatever data system is collected. Can you see the second column? It says segment type.
- Me: Y.
- Them: Yeah. So this one particularly you might have corrected, created the Shopify Purchasers, Shopify Basket Amenders. If you see the very first one download, that is a conversion base that is automatically created. Correct. The fourth one that says Begin checkout. So people who have clicked on Begin Checkout system is also trying to record the people who are clicking on begin checkout as well.
- Me: Eah, I see what you mean. Yeah.
- Them: So you can use these particular data while creating a display marketing campaign. Because this is the main thing that we need to do when we start a new campaign. Okay. And this is.
- Me: So these are all less than a thousand size though, aren't they?
- Them: Yeah, yeah. But until. Unless it doesn't say that too small to serve, we can still use them. So basically, they're still populating. If you'll see, on the very top it says size for every of the channel. Correct. So it will keep recording the data for the people. If it doesn't say. Too small to serve. We can use that.
- Me: Okay? Okay?
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So you. So you're actually. So you're actually talking about creating a campaign?
- Them: Take with us.
- Me: Just for display, so we're just going to use image assets for it.
- Them: Yeah. Image assets. And using those particular lists that you think particularly can retarget those people who are. I believe I'll say that. Who are mostly likely to convert or make a purchase.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: So you can have a discussion with the client and then you can go ahead and do that. Okay. Can you see this has been eligible. Yeah. This one. So we will pause the previous one. That doesn't have any of the hashtag go back the post one will pause. Yum.
- Me: But are we not going to disrupt the algorithm if we pause that one?
- Them: Okay, so what is happening here? We have pasted the same campaign here. Okay? It will not pause that. System would have an increase in budget of £40.
- Me: Right.
- Them: Okay, because we have just pasted the same campaign there. So just to kickstart that particular, that particular promotional code that we have, we have pasted the same campaign without creating a new one, so that the campaign that is given is a good conversion value would start that. So if that's okay with you, what we can do. We can keep both of the campaigns running for a while. Once this particular campaign, the hashtag2campaign is also good data, then you can pause the previous one.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Correct. So that you can also have a track either the coupon is being used or not.
- Me: Right. I'm just. I'm just dubious of posing any campaign that's been performing well and replacing it with another one.
- Them: See, it's not like that. We are replacing that. We have just copied and pasted the same campaign.
- Me: Yes, we have done. But the history, the history, the diversion history of the campaign is against the campaign.
- Them: Okay? We are talking about it. Whatever data the campaign, the previous campaign is collected, it might not be present in the new campaign, correct?
- Me: Correct? Yeah.
- Them: Okay, so whenever we create a new campaign and the campaign is using any of the data, it's not based on what we have provided. Previously. It is based on what audience we have linked to it and what of the data is using from the account. So you might have provided some of the audience to this particular campaign as well. Correct. When system in like 24 hours, when system sees that this particular campaign is same as the previous campaign and there are no changes on that, the audience will say the targeted segment is same. Then system do not put that particular campaign on a bid strategy learning for very long.
- Me: Right, okay.
- Them: Okay, so that is. I'm saying that just wait for. I'll say just three to four days. You can see whatever. You can compare the performance in both of the campaign. The new campaign would give you same performance as the previous one was giving us.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Okay?
- Me: So.
- Them: So once.
- Me: So I was going to say that the, the, so the, the promotion of £400 is only going to kick in if it does actually spend £400 in a 30 day period.
- Them: Could you please repeat that? I just missed it.
- Me: So the, the, the, the, the, the voucher code we've just put in will only work if it spends £400 in the next 30 days.
- Them: Yeah. See, we have to make sure that our campaigns are particularly like spending £400 in next 30 days.
- Me: Yeah, okay.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Yeah. Yeah, fine. I. I mean, I actually don't know is about that with it being over Christmas. Whether it. Whether it will actually do it or not, you can see that.
- Them: Okay, let's compare. Let's put the date range for last 40 days. Fourteen days. Sorry. Go to the date range, put the data for last 14 days.
- Me: 14.
- Them: Take me to the cost scroll down. Take me to cost, okay? Column cost. Scroll to. Okay, if I see a total scroll down. Scroll down. Total search campaign. Okay. The total cost is 637. Okay. So I believe it's very much doable. That campaign would be using 400,000 x 15 days only, correct?
- Me: Yeah, well, we've got nothing to lose anyway, so.
- Them: Yeah, exactly. Because promotional code is has already been applied to the account. So even if the campaign is spending £400, that is something that Google is providing you.
- Me: Yeah, I'm just going to pause that other one. There was another one just popped up there.
- Them: Correct.
- Me: That was. And we only want one of these, so I've just paused the other one.
- Them: It's only one hashtag 2 one that is eligible, rather than that you can see there, paused and removed.
- Me: Yeah, I've just paused it. I've just paused that with all.
- Them: The first one. The previous one or the new one?
- Me: No. If you look at the bottom of that screen there, there was. There. There was two that had been pasted. And they were both. They were both unable. So it just paused the bottom ones. We've only got one copied, one that is actually enabled along with that.
- Them: Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay?
- Me: Okay?
- Them: We have done that. Okay. So perfect, Peter. So what we have done is we have applied the particular code in the Google Ads account. We have kick started a new campaign there with a new budget so that the campaign can use the previous data and give you that particular result as same as the previous campaign as well as use the promotional code.
- Me: Yeah. Okay?
- Them: Okay, second thing, I just want you to have a look over the optimization score as well. You already know everything about that, correct? So I'll not give any of the extra knowledge to you regarding that. Okay. Just make sure that we are keeping that score above 90% because this generally shows us how well we have set our ads to perform, okay?
- Me: Okay?
- Them: I do also have a look for a display remarketing campaign. Okay?
- Me: I will.
- Them: And anytime if you need help regarding the display remarketing campaign, any kind of help, you can always reach out to me via particularly email and I'll be happy to schedule an appointment with you.
- Me: Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you very much.
- Them: Okay? So what I'll do? I'll just ask Rohan to send you a follow up call for the 14th day so that we can see how the promotional code worked for us, how the new campaign worked for us for those particular 14 days. Do not make any of the further changes for the Google Ads account.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Yeah, no problem.
- Them: And campaign can use twice of the daily budget anytime, but it would never exceed what we have on the monthly budget Part. Okay. Rohan will be sending you minutes of meeting of whatever we have discussed.
- Me: Okay? Yeah.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Right. Okay. Yeah.
- Them: And if you anytime face any kind of issue, you can always reach out to me via particularly email. Okay?
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Is there anything else? And I can answer?
- Me: No, that's fine. Thank you very much.
- Them: Okay, perfect, then. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
- Me: Bye. Bye.
- Them: Bye. Bye. Have a great day.

Me: Well, you've described my client's business. Yes, My business is a consultancy.
Them: Yeah. Your clients business. Okay. And what we are looking out is more of the sales and leads.
Me: Well, Sales is an ecom site.
Them: So basically, when we talk about this particular thing, that sales, any of the number that you want to mention, like how many sales did we get for the last month?
Me: Oh, I have no idea. Do we have to do this sort of detail? Can I just give you a bit of background to what I do?
Them: Yeah, please. Look. Please.
Me: I've done good guys for 25 years now I have calls like this. Pretty much every day for the 11 clients, which I have. The reason for taking the call, I'll be very honest with you, is I just want the promo code. I don't need any advice on the client whatsoever. They're a smallish client. They rely on one product during summer.
Them: Okay?
Me: Which is a grouting product. And during the winter, they're going to just be ticking over. There's not a lot they can do. It's a relatively new account for me and for them.
Them: Okay?
Me: So we're still building it. It's still getting provenance. We're still learning. And as far as very detailed advice on the way in which the campaigns are to work. Personally, I don't think they're relevant at the moment. And my experience of these sort of calls is that you can just go through the recommendations tab and you're going to talk about demand you and you're going to talk about YouTube, and I'm just not interested in that at all. I'm just very keen to get £400 off the client's. Bill for the month. So I'm being honest with you. Please don't take that personally.
Them: No, no, no. I'm not taking that personally. Perfect. I don't understand that. Because see, we have to do this, correct. Like to understand or to suggest you anything for the Google Ads account. We need to understand your business, correct? So that was just a basic ask that we need to complete before we go on any of the call, which is perfectly fine. If you're saying that you have been answering these type of question from quite a long time, I really understand your presentation.
Me: I've not been answering those sort of questions because those sort of questions be answered just by looking at the Google Ads account. That's data that you can see.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Then what I want from your end is to just share the screen for the Google Ads account so that I can just suggest you what steps we need to follow when we talk about the promotional code.
Me: Yep. Sure about them in second.
Them: Perfect. Perfect. And all the Google Ads like these campaigns we are running. So you have set up them with yourself.
Me: I've set them up. Yes.
Them: Okay, perfect. So I'll just take few minutes to fetch the promotional code for the Google Ads account.
Me: Okay?
Them: Okay. Allow me some moment. I'm just fetching it out.
Me: Okay?
Them: I'm sending the code the same email. That is a peter e at Roksys co uk. Is that okay?
Me: Yes, that's fine.
Them: O. Kay. Allow me a moment. I've just dropped an email to your particular email address. Let me know once you have received it, okay?
Me: Okay, I've got that.
Them: Now copy the code that I have provided in the bracket.
Me: Yep. Got that?
Them: Okay, now come to the Google Ads account. In the very left. Click on billing. Now click on that. Click on. Yeah. Can you see Promotions. Go there. Promotions. Okay, click on pass. Yeah. Perfect. Paste it here. Okay. Click on submit. Perfect. Now, what we have done, we have redeemed this particular promotional code. Now, can you see? It says complete for the requirements. Correct.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Okay, now what you have to do. Go back to campaigns. So now we have redeemed it today. Okay, so now we have 30 days to particularly use this promotional code.
Me: Okay?
Them: So what you have to do in the 30 days you need to use at least £400 so that this particular £400 that you have used it get back credited to the Google Ads account.
Me: Okay?
Them: Okay? Now, the further requirement says that means that what we need to do. From these particular campaigns. I can see this gog pmax campaign. Correct. So, if you'll see this particular campaign, have this conversion value of 101,766. Correct. So what we'll do, we'll not make any of the specific changes for the campaign. What we'll do, we'll just copy this campaign. Paste it again so that campaign would be eligible to use that particular promotional code in such a way that it is like. I'll say it is using the budget, but via the promotional code. So it would treat the campaign as a very new campaign. And that particular new campaign would be using the promotional code.
Me: Right. Right.
Them: Okay, so just click on the checkbox in front of gogp Max campaign. Yeah. Click on edit copy.
Me: Right.
Them: Okay, now uncheck this Gogpack campaign. On the top, you would be able to see paste. Yeah. Okay, done. Yeah. Don't select anything, just click on paste. You have selected. Pause new campaign.
Me: Yes. I just wanted to see what it's going to do.
Them: Okay? You need to change the campaign status to all. Okay, can you see this? Where it is? It might have. Just wait. We just pasted this gog one correct.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Scroll down. Scroll down little bit. Okay. We have only these many campaigns. I believe it has not been pasted. Paste it once again. Yeah. And don't select anything. Okay? Click on done. Click on page directly. Yeah.
Me: So the. The promotional code only applies to new campaigns, then?
Them: It's not like that. It's just to just activate the promotional code. We just need to kick start one of the campaign.
Me: Okay?
Them: Okay?
Me: Yeah. I've never known a code like this.
Them: It's still updating. Sorry.
Me: I've never known a code like this.
Them: Yeah, I believe this is for see to be various. This is for only few of the clients. I handle many of the accounts in a day. But this has been created to few of the clients. That Google thing, they should use it. So I'm not sure what cell eligibility criteria behind that, but it's very new. This is a very new criteria.
Me: Okay? Okay?
Them: It's still updating. I believe before this it was not pasted. That is why we were not able to see any of the new campaign.
Me: Right.
Them: We have to wait until it gets updated. And as you already mentioned that you know that what recommendations you should apply for the account and from where you can check it. Right now the account is already at 86.1% and the week on week growth is also very good by 3% of the increase. Just maintain the same score or try to maintain a little high from what we have right now. Okay, what we can do, we can add few of the video is it in the Performance Max campaign so that we can expand our reach on YouTube as well.
Me: Okay? That's easiest said, then.
Them: Okay?
Me: Done.
Them: That is why we have not selected that. And one more is there is expand your reach with Google Search Partner. So it would include some of the websites, like Bench and more like that. So are we not doing that? Intentionally. We are not doing. That.
Me: No, traditionally they don't produce the same level of roas as just the Google. Real estate, so I never. I never bother.
Them: Okay, so we have tried that in past. That is why we are stating this correct.
Me: Correct? Yes.
Them: Okay? Perfect. Then that is totally up to you.
Me: Is this worth refreshing?
Them: Can try it once. Either it will stop or it will paste. Otherwise we have to follow the same thing again. Still, only if the three campaigns try it once again. Okay, are we operating this over Safari or Chrome?
Me: Yeah, we got to. These two at the bottom here. So let me just get rid of that one.
Them: Are we having this particular thing? Over safari or chrome.
Me: This is chrome. It's here. The. The new campaigns here.
Them: Yeah. Now. It's here. Okay, activate this one. Click on.
Me: This is paul. System error.
Them: System error. Okay, just do it once again. Remove this one as well and then paste it once again. Yeah. Okay? Perfect. Now close. Yeah. Now paste. Perfect. Yeah, paste directly. Perfect. I think it's updating a little slow.
Me: It says isn't. That.
Them: Yeah. That is why we were not able to see the previous pasted campaigns, correct?
Me: Yeah, well, that's these two here. There's no hash one there, though.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Me: Which is a bit weird.
Them: They would be a hash again now. So just wait until get pasted. Because previously I remember that we have not selected like pause the new campaign, correct? So I think it automatically got paused.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So we'll just wait for it to get updated. Let's see what happens. The status for the next the hashtag3campaign has not been updated for removed as well.
Me: That one.
Them: The last one? Yeah. This one.
Me: Oh, I see. It's got the remove there, but as you say. It's not.
Them: Okay? Refresh once. Let's see what happens now. Yeah, it's there. See, it's in past eight again. Says system error. Okay.
Me: One. Yet.
Them: Click on view details. Yeah. Let's see what's happening. What's the error? It says zero error. I believe we. We just need to provide this particular campaign some time. Because if you'll see it says run date and time. Start it the three December but ended is not available. I believe there is an issue with that. Go back to the campaigns again. Or if you could just close this tab and again, open this particular Google Ads account, that would be great. System would be able to have this particular thing. Yeah. Okay? Now click on paste. Yeah. Taste. Now. We'll wait until it get pasted, okay.
Me: So this says, pasting your campaigns there. He didn't say that last time. He just says it's. Oh, there we go. Right. Okay.
Them: No. It did. Yeah.
Me: Which is a bit slower.
Them: On the very start.
Me: This time.
Them: We missed out on these particular two campaigns that we removed. I think there were no system error before.
Me: Right.
Them: Or. Or we didn't pay attention there. No worries. We'll try to do it this way. Let's see how much time it takes for this particular one. So specifically, we are running basically a shopping campaigns, like we want more of the people to buy. So how you are dealing with the people who are basically adding something to the cart but not making any of the purchase?
Me: Well, I presume P. Max will deal with a lot of that.
Them: Okay like remarketing thing you are doing with PMAX only.
Me: Well, P Max is a certain amount of remarketing anyway, doesn't it? But I've got a remarketing asset group. There.
Them: Okay, so basically, I'll just suggest one thing. Okay, this is up to you. What? You want to apply for the Google Ad account or not? So basically, like, the best campaign that we suggest for the remarketing thing is a display campaign. Because everything we see is a visual representation. Correct. So whenever we are seeing anything and we are adding to the cart, it is an image on our mind. So whenever we use this particular display remarketing campaign, that plays a very vital role in convincing the people who have already added something in the card and then making a purchase. So we always suggest. Like when we talk about the remarketing thing, we always and always go for a display remarketing campaign with a maximized conversion of the bidding strategy.
Me: So rather than rather that than a demand gen.
Them: Exactly. If you're creating asset group, what you can do, you can just take out some of the budget from the existing campaign. Or if you want to put a new budget on the new campaign, you can just start like for the remarketing only you can start that particular display remarketing campaign there you can add the existing audience that we have. Correct. Once you add the existing audience there display campaign will do its work.
Me: So add it as a display count. I've not added a display campaign for years.
Them: Yes.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: I cannot see that. I think you have not write a display campaign yet. We are only running, I believe shopping and PMAX campaign, correct?
Me: No, I mean across all my clients, I've not run a display campaign. For years. You know, a pure display campaign. Which Targeting remarketing. So that's that.
Them: Yeah.
Me: 's. That's a new concept for me. I don't know. I'm not a great fan of display campaigns, but certainly for re marketing. It's quite interesting.
Them: And as you in the start mentioned that you are just learning like you have so many things to do in this particular Google Ads account. That is why suggested up to you what you can do. You can have like you can have a research on the display remarketing campaign how it can work best for you. Correct? Because this is particularly yo and your client's business. Whatever feels good for you guys, you can go ahead and do that. Just being in account manager align with the Rohan I have just think one thing to say. Because what's the important part is how many people we are losing on a stage where they can really convert, but they are not converting.
Me: Right. I think the only, the only issue with a, with a remarketing campaign for, for this client is, is not having enough data.
Them: Correct.
Me: It's. I don't think there's enough traffic running through the site to warrant a remarketing campaign. We can't make the audience segments big enough.
Them: In the very left click on admin. Let's see if we have turned that particular customer list things on in the Google Ads account. Okay, see, Conversion based list is on. Okay, now go to tools in the left. Okay, click on planning. Planning. Sorry. Click on shared library. Yeah. Audience manager. Okay, so basically, these all are the list. So can you see this? Shopify purchasers. We can target these people because this has a size that can be used for a campaign. And these all are the segments that system has created for you according to what people have been interacting with the website that you have.
Me: Well, I've created that. I've created that as a customer list.
Them: If you'll see the segment type there, you can see how many you created and how many have been created automatically based on whatever data system is collected. Can you see the second column? It says segment type.
Me: Y.
Them: Yeah. So this one particularly you might have corrected, created the Shopify Purchasers, Shopify Basket Amenders. If you see the very first one download, that is a conversion base that is automatically created. Correct. The fourth one that says Begin checkout. So people who have clicked on Begin Checkout system is also trying to record the people who are clicking on begin checkout as well.
Me: Eah, I see what you mean. Yeah.
Them: So you can use these particular data while creating a display marketing campaign. Because this is the main thing that we need to do when we start a new campaign. Okay. And this is.
Me: So these are all less than a thousand size though, aren't they?
Them: Yeah, yeah. But until. Unless it doesn't say that too small to serve, we can still use them. So basically, they're still populating. If you'll see, on the very top it says size for every of the channel. Correct. So it will keep recording the data for the people. If it doesn't say. Too small to serve. We can use that.
Me: Okay? Okay?
Them: Okay?
Me: So you. So you're actually. So you're actually talking about creating a campaign?
Them: Take with us.
Me: Just for display, so we're just going to use image assets for it.
Them: Yeah. Image assets. And using those particular lists that you think particularly can retarget those people who are. I believe I'll say that. Who are mostly likely to convert or make a purchase.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: So you can have a discussion with the client and then you can go ahead and do that. Okay. Can you see this has been eligible. Yeah. This one. So we will pause the previous one. That doesn't have any of the hashtag go back the post one will pause. Yum.
Me: But are we not going to disrupt the algorithm if we pause that one?
Them: Okay, so what is happening here? We have pasted the same campaign here. Okay? It will not pause that. System would have an increase in budget of £40.
Me: Right.
Them: Okay, because we have just pasted the same campaign there. So just to kickstart that particular, that particular promotional code that we have, we have pasted the same campaign without creating a new one, so that the campaign that is given is a good conversion value would start that. So if that's okay with you, what we can do. We can keep both of the campaigns running for a while. Once this particular campaign, the hashtag2campaign is also good data, then you can pause the previous one.
Me: Okay?
Them: Correct. So that you can also have a track either the coupon is being used or not.
Me: Right. I'm just. I'm just dubious of posing any campaign that's been performing well and replacing it with another one.
Them: See, it's not like that. We are replacing that. We have just copied and pasted the same campaign.
Me: Yes, we have done. But the history, the history, the diversion history of the campaign is against the campaign.
Them: Okay? We are talking about it. Whatever data the campaign, the previous campaign is collected, it might not be present in the new campaign, correct?
Me: Correct? Yeah.
Them: Okay, so whenever we create a new campaign and the campaign is using any of the data, it's not based on what we have provided. Previously. It is based on what audience we have linked to it and what of the data is using from the account. So you might have provided some of the audience to this particular campaign as well. Correct. When system in like 24 hours, when system sees that this particular campaign is same as the previous campaign and there are no changes on that, the audience will say the targeted segment is same. Then system do not put that particular campaign on a bid strategy learning for very long.
Me: Right, okay.
Them: Okay, so that is. I'm saying that just wait for. I'll say just three to four days. You can see whatever. You can compare the performance in both of the campaign. The new campaign would give you same performance as the previous one was giving us.
Me: Okay?
Them: Okay?
Me: So.
Them: So once.
Me: So I was going to say that the, the, so the, the promotion of £400 is only going to kick in if it does actually spend £400 in a 30 day period.
Them: Could you please repeat that? I just missed it.
Me: So the, the, the, the, the, the voucher code we've just put in will only work if it spends £400 in the next 30 days.
Them: Yeah. See, we have to make sure that our campaigns are particularly like spending £400 in next 30 days.
Me: Yeah, okay.
Them: Okay?
Me: Yeah. Yeah, fine. I. I mean, I actually don't know is about that with it being over Christmas. Whether it. Whether it will actually do it or not, you can see that.
Them: Okay, let's compare. Let's put the date range for last 40 days. Fourteen days. Sorry. Go to the date range, put the data for last 14 days.
Me: 14.
Them: Take me to the cost scroll down. Take me to cost, okay? Column cost. Scroll to. Okay, if I see a total scroll down. Scroll down. Total search campaign. Okay. The total cost is 637. Okay. So I believe it's very much doable. That campaign would be using 400,000 x 15 days only, correct?
Me: Yeah, well, we've got nothing to lose anyway, so.
Them: Yeah, exactly. Because promotional code is has already been applied to the account. So even if the campaign is spending £400, that is something that Google is providing you.
Me: Yeah, I'm just going to pause that other one. There was another one just popped up there.
Them: Correct.
Me: That was. And we only want one of these, so I've just paused the other one.
Them: It's only one hashtag 2 one that is eligible, rather than that you can see there, paused and removed.
Me: Yeah, I've just paused it. I've just paused that with all.
Them: The first one. The previous one or the new one?
Me: No. If you look at the bottom of that screen there, there was. There. There was two that had been pasted. And they were both. They were both unable. So it just paused the bottom ones. We've only got one copied, one that is actually enabled along with that.
Them: Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay?
Me: Okay?
Them: We have done that. Okay. So perfect, Peter. So what we have done is we have applied the particular code in the Google Ads account. We have kick started a new campaign there with a new budget so that the campaign can use the previous data and give you that particular result as same as the previous campaign as well as use the promotional code.
Me: Yeah. Okay?
Them: Okay, second thing, I just want you to have a look over the optimization score as well. You already know everything about that, correct? So I'll not give any of the extra knowledge to you regarding that. Okay. Just make sure that we are keeping that score above 90% because this generally shows us how well we have set our ads to perform, okay?
Me: Okay?
Them: I do also have a look for a display remarketing campaign. Okay?
Me: I will.
Them: And anytime if you need help regarding the display remarketing campaign, any kind of help, you can always reach out to me via particularly email and I'll be happy to schedule an appointment with you.
Me: Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Them: Okay? So what I'll do? I'll just ask Rohan to send you a follow up call for the 14th day so that we can see how the promotional code worked for us, how the new campaign worked for us for those particular 14 days. Do not make any of the further changes for the Google Ads account.
Me: Okay?
Them: Okay?
Me: Yeah, no problem.
Them: And campaign can use twice of the daily budget anytime, but it would never exceed what we have on the monthly budget Part. Okay. Rohan will be sending you minutes of meeting of whatever we have discussed.
Me: Okay? Yeah.
Them: Okay?
Me: Right. Okay. Yeah.
Them: And if you anytime face any kind of issue, you can always reach out to me via particularly email. Okay?
Me: Okay?
Them: Is there anything else? And I can answer?
Me: No, that's fine. Thank you very much.
Them: Okay, perfect, then. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
Me: Bye. Bye.
Them: Bye. Bye. Have a great day.
