Meeting participants: Mdurand, Peter Empson

Transcript:
 
Me: Example, now I can see all the hero products for Happy Snap Gifts.  
Them: Hello. Hi. Sorry, I was just coming off another call. How are you?  
Me: I was busy talking to Claude. That's how sad I am. I was busy talking to Claude.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: I got voice to text on my computer, so I'm busy talking to AI all day now. That's how my world is.  
Them: Oh, AI has taken over. Fortunately. Or fortunately.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: How was your trip your way last week?  
Me: It was a way. Just for Friday. Friday lunchtime.  
Them: Lovely.  
Me: So we just went up to the lakes for the weekend. So it was nice.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: Yeah, usual lakes weather, but I don't really care. I've got a coat.  
Them: For the latest strike, Peter.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: I was there this year for the first time.  
Me: Okay. First time. Wow.  
Them: Yeah. First time I did the scaffold pike.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Hike. And it took eight hours because we accidentally did the advanced route.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: So we didn't follow the path. We were, like, scaling the mountain, which I hadn't done before.  
Me: Oh, no. What a shame. It's actually quite a nice walk up scale. Foul.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's not too severe. If you do the right path, it is quite pleasant. And did you do both of them? Do you Scarfell? I needed Scarfell Pike.  
Them: Yes. So we definitely were off the highest peak.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: So I think what happened was because we went that the normal route, the way died, and I was like, yes, this looks a lot easier, and it was a lot busier as well. And then on the way up, it was. Like people with a lot more gear. They had their sticks and they look like they're scaling vertical. And I was like, I don't know.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I did it. I was fine. Yeah.  
Me: Did you go from Waswater? Do you do from the wasp water side or from the altar water?  
Them: I don't know.  
Me: Not done. Adele. The hard not plus side.  
Them: I think so. I think. There was like a stables. Maybe it was labels, but there was like a coffee place at the start.  
Me: Okay? Okay. Wasn't the railway, though, was there?  
Them: I don't think so.  
Me: Okay. Oh, you would have seen it if you. If you.  
Them: Yeah. I don't think it was a railway.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I don't know. I wasn't really paying attention until I was, like, at the. It was. It was a good hike.  
Me: Well done, you. That's brilliant. I sponsored in England.  
Them: Say again?  
Me: Highest mountain in England.  
Them: Exactly. That's always happy. I did it because there's three. Right, so you have in the uk, so Wales is the penny farm. Is that the highest?  
Me: Now I see a wood for it, Snowden.  
Them: Okay, and then what's the one in Scotland?  
Me: Nevis.  
Them: Ah, yes, By Nevis. Yeah. Yeah. So there are the two peaks. So, yeah, I was happy to have it done in the cloud Possible, but it was good. And, yeah, we stayed in, like, a carbon outland. It was gorgeous. So I could see what the. What the fuss was about.  
Me: Lovely. Yeah. It's our happy place. The latest. Absolutely love it. We're going back again in a couple of weeks time.  
Them: Have you replaced there, or do you stay in the Ardiva Company?  
Me: No, we took the camper van. It's a National Trust site we went to this time in two weeks. My brother in law's got a cottage up there.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: So going up there with them. But, yeah, any excuse to get up there. We do.  
Them: It's nice to go off season. I think I was there in March, so it was. Or no, it was May. Sorry. And it was just before it was getting busy and I was like, this is a nice time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: To go when it's not too hectic, but.  
Me: I just found a chance with the weather is done at that time.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. It's not. It's not absolutely Baltic as well. I actually think May can be one of the nicer months in summer. January. But, yeah, it was lovely. UK periods at this call recorded.  
Me: Nice. I was going to say the same to you.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, perfect.  
Me: Finally.  
Them: I'll just open with the apology and not. I don't have any update on the case. I don't know.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: What is going on? It's been. Turning late. I've chased it off, like, at least once a week so far, and I think it's just something that they don't know how to resolve. And it's just sitting with a team that doesn't seem to be able to resolve it.  
Me: Right.  
Them: But it's where it needs to be right now.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That's kind of all.  
Me: It's just embarrassing. I'm just getting battered with this. Absolutely, Barton. They can't believe that Google don't know how to fix it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's frustrating because it's an intrinsic part of the strategy as well, actually having the PMAX campaign in there. And, yeah, it's a pain. Real pain anyway.  
Them: Yeah. So I'll just double check again, but. Yeah, no, I agree. I don't know why they're not able to. Resolve it. Let me see. Yeah, look. There just isn't much more that I can do. In terms of, like, I don't want to say I'll do something, and that will speed up the process because it's sitting who it needs to sit. But. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see what we could do. I'll keep you updated anyway.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That's what we can do for today. And other than that, I had a couple of things just in terms of a couple of optimizations I saw on the account and any updates we can start there that you have on your side. Anything going on? Yeah.  
Me: Well, budgets are dropped again for November, which was planned. Which I think we talked about that last time, so I just dropped stuff down. They are responsive to. If things are going particularly well, then I can actually say can have some more money for this campaign. And I think it's going to do this. The results were okay. Last month quite happy with them. I've not done my month end report yet for it. But they did okay.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: The who I was doing particularly well. Wish they're happy about that. Was a target for them. The Hide went live mid month. Early days. Yeah, I don't think the conversion tracking was working correctly at the start.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I think that has now been resolved and hopefully we'll start to get some more traffic coming through on that. Also more.  
Them: Sorry. No, I didn't mean to cut across here. I have a note on enhanced conversions for Web, but I don't know because you seem to have Enhanced conversions needs attention at the moment on your Cavendish. It's definitely not pronouncing that right. Your Cavendish. It has.  
Me: Yeah. No, it hasn't.  
Them: Okay, okay.  
Me: No.  
Them: Is that in the works at all, do you know?  
Me: It's been in the worst for the last 18 months. Yeah.  
Them: Okay. Okay. Grunt. Okay, so we gotta. We'll get.  
Me: It's something that's going to be discussed in the next couple of weeks, hopefully. We spoke about last time. They're just very precious about sharing data, and they think that they're actually exposing their soul to Google by doing enhanced conversions. So I'm just getting together a document to give to them. To explain what enhanced conversions are again. For about the 10th time and why it should be done, so I'm cool with that. And last time we spoke, you would jump on a call with them just to discuss it. I put that through to them as well, so I can't do any more. Megan, it's just.  
Them: You all we can do? No, I think I was just confused because it says it needs attention, so it's like maybe there's some sort of setup there, but that it also.  
Me: Set up.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: But usually it doesn't say anything, so that's why it's kind of double checking.  
Me: It's nothing. Yeah, I'm looking at myself. I get it. I totally get it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I've been looking at the same thing for the last 18 months and being frustrated by it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But if that's not something they don't want to do, then that's whatever. And it's also the devs. They have limited dev time and this is not a priority in the slightest.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I am the lowest of the low.  
Them: Okay? No worries. I know with my Google Ads is 100% of our time, but about 4% of business owners thought.  
Me: And about 95% of their income. Yes.  
Them: Yes. Yeah. Make it make sense.  
Me: Put it in context.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, for sure. That's a lot of what my conversations are around as well.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So. Okay, that's fine. So they're lowering budgets, but they're open to increasing because that would bring me on to retail radar, which. Let me make sure I hop this over here. Believe we went through this before. You've probably seen it anyway with Google account strategist. So this is the missed opportunity and just something that you could share with them, just to kind of put it into context. So it goes through missed opportunity due to budget restraints and missed opportunity due to bids.  
Me: You bashed me over the head with stuff I've been bashed around with too many times, to be honest. I get it. Honestly, Megan, I get it. And I can't do a thing about it. I understand all of this. I understand limited by budget, the roas losing on bids and all the rest of it. And I convey this to them every single month. And there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. All I can do is optimize the accounts.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: It's frustrating. I've shared this information with them hundreds of times, and they don't read it. They're not interested.  
Them: No, it's just because you'd mentioned if the account is doing well, there might be room to get more budget.  
Me: Yeah. And I just jump in. Very granular. I don't necessarily need to look at the bigger picture with them. I just say this has happened the first two weeks of the month. We're now out of budget, or we're limited by budget. If we increase by this much, this is where we're likely to be, and it does it every time. So it really is a case of addressing it there and then rather than saying at the beginning of the month, we need to have more budget overall.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: This? Because what we do is they shuffle budget around from somewhere else that isn't doing as well.  
Them: Gotcha.  
Me: Like anywhere and just give it to me. So yeah. Beyond that, there's not a lot else I can do apart from get the campaigns running to as much best practice as I possibly can, and that's the stance I have to take with them.  
Them: Okay, so this might be more useful, because, again, it does do a campaign breakdown. So. But as you said, they're not really looking at the ins and outs and the intricacies of it. So if it's worth it, I can send this to you anyway, just towards the end of the month, just to see what that looks like and what they are. Yeah. And then when they are a little bit more limited.  
Me: By all means.  
Them: We can review that as well.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, the other thing I was going to ask about was on the new customer acquisition goals. So I think you do you have this on this PMOX campaign, you have it at the 1p value. Ideally, we want that across all campaigns. So any campaign that's using value based bidding, this will not necessarily, but any campaign that's using value based bidding,  
Me: I thought it was.  
Them: No, it's not on this one. So.  
Me: Sorry. Which one are you looking at?  
Them: Property arms.  
Me: Them to your arms.  
Them: Yeah. So it says here. My screen is gucci. Where do I see it?  
Me: Okay, I've missed that one out.  
Them: And then. The Cavendish as well. So it seems the search campaigns don't have it switched on.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So you can do it across all campaigns at once if you want to do it in a clean sleep.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: Yeah. So if you tick the box, do you see my screen?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. So I'm not going to do. And this is how you would do it. So tick the box beside anything that's on value based bidding and then go to edit. Update customer acquisition. And she'll come up with the account level value, which is 0.01, and then hit apply. And then that will apply it to all the campaigns that you selected.  
Me: Wonderful. Done.  
Them: Great.  
Me: I actually just ticked on everything, whether it was value based or not. It looks like it's going to do it.  
Them: Yeah. What make a difference for your max conversions campaign, you can switch back to new customer only if you did want that to be the focus. That's a workaround for say, if you didn't have values in an account and you're only have the maximized conversions or CPA strategy. We do that. A lot with lead gen, where if you want maybe one campaign that just focuses on new customers that will take all most of the attention from other campaigns, you'll see a lower ROAS because obviously it's focusing on new customers if you increase the volume more than 1p. So that's one way you can do that as well if you are looking to focus a little bit on them.  
Me: Ok? Yeah, that's all done.  
Them: Cool. And then I think the other thing was you have AI Max. But I was looking at this recommendation here. So are these couple of campaigns. It's showing a good potential increase uplift in value when you if you were to switch it on these campaigns as well.  
Me: Ok? I mean, really. I want to switch it on across the board.  
Them: You can. Like, you can switch it on across all of these campaign types. Also with AI Max, I know we talked about this before, but it's confirmed that next year you'll be able to serve on AI Mode. Gemini AI overview, google lens and google circle. So having it kind of fully established within the account before that happens is ideal. I had someone ask me today, Is that the only way you'll get on it next year? No, but it's the way that you can make sure that you're ahead of the curve.  
Me: Ok? I can't do this across the board, can I? I'm going to have to go into each one.  
Them: You can go to apply all in the recommendations tab. So if you go to. Recommendations. You can see the 3.8% uplift here. You eight and then hit the file.  
Me: Ok? Done.  
Them: Great. And running through things very efficiently, Peter. That was the main thing that I wanted to go through.  
Me: You know what? I just. I don't have enough hours in the day at the moment. I really don't. It's all got a bit crazy. And the thing is, I'm using. I'm using AI to do things more efficiently. I'm just doing more things now.  
Them: The.  
Me: But they're far more granular. Far more granular. It's got ridiculous.  
Them: Thing with the AI.  
Me: Yeah. I've got a means by which I can track product performance over time. And eventually I'll be able to predict whether a change in price would increase or decrease the roas and the revenue.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Over time, bits away off yet, but it's trying to make it very client specific and getting alerts on disapprovals quickly.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: All sorts of stuff. I think my head's going to explode very soon.  
Them: No, we don't want that. No. You need more trips to the lake, and then I'll balance it out. Yeah.  
Me: But yeah. I've just got to build this framework. Yet. And once that's built, then it should make things easy. It might just ease up a little bit. I hope.  
Them: So it's like time you're putting in into now, what's going to save you time in the future?  
Me: Very much so. Yeah, very much so. But it needs to be about 25 hours in a day, something like that.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? Oh, jesus. Yeah. It only happens once a year. Is there anything, any resources or anything you want from our side that could help? Anything?  
Me: I don't think so. No, I'm good. Sitting with Devin Share. I said that's the absolute priority is the PMAX campaign.  
Them: Gr.  
Me: I've got a meeting with them on Monday next week, so, my guy, it'd be amazing if we can actually get something back from them by then.  
Them: Ab.  
Me: I think the frustrating thing is that somebody's done it. Someone at Google has got rid of it, or the system has got rid of it. And there's no track of what it was originally when it actually worked, and it worked fine.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I don't understand why they can't just recreate what that was.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And in my eyes, it doesn't seem to be a priority for them to fix it. As you say. It's like I don't know how to fix it for I'm not going to do anything at all. Which is massively frustrating for you and me.  
Them: Yeah. No, I agree. But sometimes it can be that the team it sits with is very small and there's people out of office, and this happens quite a lot. It's such a big company, you don't think it should happen, but.  
Me: Yeah. It's been over two weeks. It's been more than two weeks, so that's what gets me.  
Them: No, I agree.  
Me: It's not as though it's a couple of days, it's a couple of weeks.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So, yeah, anything you can do, Megan. Appreciate it.  
Them: Yeah, yeah. I'll see what I can do on my side and get back to you. But other than that, I can give you some time back, Peter, if you want to keep building your tools.  
Me: Okay? I really appreciate that.  
Them: It makes a huge difference.  
Me: It will massively.  
Them: Time is money. Okay, perfect. I can pop it. Earl. Just. I'll be in touch and I'll schedule a follow up, but I'll be in for that with the resolution as well. And if you need anything else, just give me a shout, okay?  
Me: Brilliant. Yes, do that. I will. Thank you very much indeed. Nice to you.  
Them: YouTube. Bye.  
Me: Bye. Bye. Now.
