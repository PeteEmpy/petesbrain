- 'Me: Pull in the european rsa descriptions. In from the. Direct place. In the Google
  Ads account via the Google Ads API. And populate the spreadsheets. That''s just
  the descriptions for the European account. Peugeot. Ormskit.'
- 'Them: Hello. By. E.'
- 'Me: Hi, megan.'
- 'Them: Peter, this is like 45 minutes after the start time, so I don''t know if
  I can see if my manager is available to join. Because it was at 10.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I didn''t get an email from you, Megan, about changing the time. You
  said change the time. I didn''t get an invite for the link or anything, so apologies.'
- 'Them: I sent you one. I said, Is 10:30 tomorrow okay? And you said, that''s fine.
  So I just thought it was fine.'
- 'Me: All right. Okay. Usually you send another email with it, an invite on it, so
  it''s okay. Whatever. That''s why at all. That''s how it lands in my calendar.'
- 'Them: Seven. Okay? Oh, maybe it didn''t reflect. In a new calendar. Sorry about
  that. That was just a miscommunication. But are you okay that this call is reported?'
- 'Me: Yep, no problem.'
- 'Them: Perfect. Okay. So. Yeah, ideally, obviously, as I said, I would have preferred
  if Terrence is here just to explain what happened with the case. I''m just kind
  of ping him now to see if he''s free. One second. But how was Eddie here? Black
  Friday campaign started to go. Clear.'
- 'Me: It was all right. It wasn''t. It didn''t blow me away this year. Black Friday.'
- 'Them: No.'
- 'Me: There was one client who did particularly well, but that was in the US. So
  the UK was a bit lackless to really.'
- 'Them: Really okay.'
- 'Me: Don''t know why. It''s the first time, really. I''ve gone nuts with making
  changes to roas and budgets and so on. Usually I make sure there''s enough budget,
  but I''ve dropped brass targets this year. Instinct to make any difference still,
  which was very odd. And that''s across a few clients as well.'
- 'Them: We do have high hopes for December as well. So obviously this isn''t related
  to necessarily.'
- 'Me: Yeah. We always have high hopes for December.'
- 'Them: We do always have. That''s very true. But I can share this with you just
  in terms of what we expect to see. Obviously it''s not as applicable for Devonshire,
  but you can see some of the days where Super Saturday last year was like 15% bigger
  than the year before. And we expect. We anticipate that or. Sorry. 37% I overshot,
  but 8% December was bigger than the year previous. So we are anticipating that it
  will. There is more opportunity that we could take advantage of. And yeah, it might
  be something. And one thing I recommend is even if there''s any kind of gift vouchers
  available, if that''s something that you could provide, we see that to quite well
  as well. So that''s like. That doesn''t need to have anything to do with like last
  shipment date. You can sell gift factories until you know the end of time. So that''s
  completely sea work quite well, but I''ll share that with you anyway. And hopefully.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Great. Thank you.'
- 'Them: Perfect. So. Yeah. And then on the case, I think what we''re gonna explain
  today is that, like, we''ve done everything that we possibly could to get it resolved.
  It''s been sent to the product team, it''s been sent to engineers. We''ve had executive
  escalation. We''ve had, you know. One of the heads of support look into it, and
  it''s just the revenue impact of the issue isn''t high enough for them to change
  it, which I know is very disappointing, but that''s. That''s all that we can do.'
- 'Me: It''s very demeaning to tell that to Devonshire as well. That''s going to be
  quite interesting.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: They''re not worth enough to Google to be able to fix it. And the frustrating
  thing, as I''ve said before, is you did it in the first place. You actually created
  those campaigns.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It wasn''t me. It wasn''t me that did it. And it''s you that removed those
  links from those campaigns. It wasn''t me.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So. And then to actually say not to take responsibility for it. And to say
  it''s not worth our while financially to rectify the mistake that we''ve made. I
  think is very poor.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s the summation of it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You know, and I just think, you know, I think you''re just treating them very,
  very badly.'
- 'Them: No, I, I, I agreed. I, I do appreciate where you''re coming from, but I think
  it was more to explain, like what we''ve done with this is all that we can do and.'
- 'Me: Yeah, but. Yeah, but it''s not. It''s not all you can do. Because what you.
  What you''ve just said is that it''s not financially worth your while.'
- 'Them: It. ''s.'
- 'Me: To do anymore. And that''s frustrating bit.'
- 'Them: S.'
- 'Me: Especially when, as I say, you had the expertise in the first place to create
  these campaigns. You had the expertise. To. To actually. Sorry. You had the expertise
  to actually create this in the first place. And yet now it''s not financially viable
  for you. To spend the time technically to fix it. I don''t get it. I really don''t.
  And it''s a very embarrassing thing for me to say to the client that Google don''t
  actually think you''re spending enough money to be able to warrant a fix to it.
  That''s. That''s the translation for it.'
- 'Them: In. Peter, look, thank you first, just for. For kicking this off first. And
  again with what?'
- 'Me: Apologies. Should have messed it up with the timing.'
- 'Them: Now. Not. Not at all. Peter, don''t. Don''t worry about it.'
- 'Me: Sorry.'
- 'Them: I think. I''ll give you context. So Megan obviously shared the situation
  that you''ve gone through the back and forth with the support teams and maybe make
  it likely hasn''t given you all of the context in the work that she''s done on it.
  But normally.'
- 'Me: Oh, I noticed. Worked hard on it, terry. That''s fine. Yeah.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Normally what we would do is we would pass on the feedback to
  our support teams and they would. They would take care of it.'
- 'Me: That goes. Without. Saying.'
- 'Them: Megan''s managed to work with the Aramibe supervisors. She''s then also managed
  to bring to the product teams and the engineering teams, which is a long step away
  from what we would normally do. So, look, from Megan''s perspective, she''s done
  a huge amount of trying to get this over the line in order to move it. Immigration,
  not just targeted for you and for your client. Ultimately, it hasn''t resulted in
  the fits that you want. And the after we have put all the hands up and acknowledge
  that. Too, for complete transparency on it. Where it sits at the moment is that
  from a resourcing perspective, we don''t have people that can work on everything.
  It''s not that they won''t get to fixing this. It''s that for the moment, in terms
  of the resources that we have from an engineering point of view. We spend a lot
  of our time with the vast majority on the time working on the things that are having
  a large impact across more and more customers. And that''s currently where it sits.
  And again, look, I know that''s not. What you want. Ideally, it''s not what we want
  either, to be honest. We prepare for low stakes and just make this easier. But ultimately
  where it sits at the moment is that the engineering team just don''t have capacity
  to be able to make fix in this instance again. It may be fixed in future, but there''s
  giving no timeline. And based on the updates that Megan''s got from the engineering
  team, they said, look, we understand that the issue is in place, but ultimately,
  we don''t have capacity to make a change for now.'
- 'Me: And as I. As I''ve just explained, this campaign was created by you. By when
  I say you, I mean google.'
- 'Them: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Specific blame to anybody at all. But it was. It was created by you initially
  as part of the original hotel''s pmax Beta. So it was created by you. The landing
  pages were removed by you. It wasn''t me. I. I know no means by which I can actually
  do that. And I have to explain to the client now that that is the case. And that
  despite the fact that it''s you that''s removed the URLs, you''re not going to.
  You''re not going to do anything about it because of resource. I get that. But also
  because Devonshire aren''t spending enough money. With you. To warrant it going
  higher up in the list. It''s not been prioritized at all because it''s a mistake
  that''s been made by Google. It''s just been put into the usual mix of is this financially
  worth our while to do it? No, it isn''t. It''s nothing at all. And the implications
  for me is a consultant are massive. I have to take responsibility for this. And
  to say this to the client. They go. What do you mean? That doesn''t make any sense
  at all, that you don''t take responsibility for your actions. It just goes back
  in the mix again as to what the financial burden is to Google to actually do this,
  and that''s a really tough one. Really tough one. I mean, what I would like for
  and I can''t change anything. I get it. It''s a big beast. What I would like is
  I would like an official email from Google to give to the client. So that it diverts.
  Everything away from me. I can''t do anything. I can''t do any more about this.
  But I would like an official explanation. In an email that I can forward onto the
  clients. As to. As to what the situation is. No, this isn''t a great thing. I think
  it''s not necessarily the financial impact to the client. Their general dealings
  with Google are just going to be soured greatly as a result of this. No, they won''t
  stop spending money with you because this is a great source of their income. But
  it just takes a knock, really leaves a sour taste in the mouth. So if you could
  do that for me, I would really appreciate that.'
- 'Them: Look, what I say on that is there won''t be an email. And look, there won''t
  be an email because Automate, that''s just not within the rules of principle that
  the company has. So they won''t write an email in order to say so. That can be passed
  on. What I can do, though, is, look, I can join those calls. I can meet with customers
  and I can explain the perspective. So that it doesn''t direct towards you. Look,
  this here, that. This isn''t your bot. We all know that. It''s an engineering based
  issue that is cropped up. That is not a tiered discretion. It''s not within your
  realm of capacity to change that, and I''m happy to say that to your direct customer
  as well. So there won''t be an email port. I can go into those calls, no problem.'
- 'Me: Okay? I''ll put that to the client. At least it gives me an option. Meghan
  has mentioned that before. And as I say, please. Begging. This is not a reflection
  on you at all. I appreciate you have been working very hard on this. And you do,
  no doubt with a company such as Google, you do actually get to a point said, no,
  you just can''t. So that''s just it, that''s the end of the road.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: It''s down to you guys, the customer facing part of the team, to actually go
  and explain this crazy situation to the client. But. Okay, I get it, right? I appreciate
  I reached the end of the road with it. I appreciate the fact, at the end of the
  day, we''re never going to be able to do anything with this. Until such a time as
  the booking engine decide to engage completely with Google and expose those landing
  pages. Ultimately the responsibility that now is going to lie with them, and the
  solution to this is more likely to come from them than from you. To do this properly,
  for want of a better description, and that might help escalate that process. But
  again, they''re a big beast as well. Whether they decide to do that or not is down
  to their miss out of my hands. So I appreciate you coming on the call. Thank you
  very much indeed.'
- 'Them: Of course, I got a lot better. I wish we were able to say, look, we can fix
  this. Unfortunately, that''s not the position we''re in, but absolutely. If there
  is a call with the customer and they were like Mr. Joan, just let me know you have
  my email. Let me know I''m with my tear to jump on and let them know what the status
  is and how it doesn''t impact you.'
- 'Me: All right. Okay, wonderful. Thank you very much. Appreciate you jumping on
  the last minute there as well, Terry.'
- 'Them: ''re all good. Okay. What I do is I''ll let it go. I''ll drop off for now.
  But again, Peter, hopefully I hear from you soon.'
- 'Me: Wonderful. Thanks. Sorry.'
- 'Them: See you later. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Bye.'
- 'Me: Thanks, Megan. Appreciate that. As I say, it''s not a reflection on you.'
- 'Them: Roys. Yeah.'
- 'Me: You worked hard on this, but we''re up against a brick wall, aren''t we?'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: So I''ll transmit this to the client and see what they come back with if they
  wanted to jump on a call. It''s going to be the same conclusion anyway. And that''s
  what I''ll like them now.'
- 'Them: Y. Es.'
- 'Me: Nothing''s going to change. Unless, as I say, the only way it''s going to change
  is if they''re booking engine change. The way in which they work.'
- 'Them: Yeah, exactly. I''m. Look, I think obviously not as impacted as you, but
  I am also frustrated because. It''s like as you said. The issue was on our side,
  and the solution isn''t on our side either. But again, it''s kind of all we can
  do for now. Is there anything like we have a couple of minutes or half up until
  three minutes passes or anything else? Okay.'
- 'Me: I''m going to spend the next five minutes just drafting an email to Devonshire,
  and then I can get them up about then.'
- 'Them: Yeah, and just say, like, you can even CC Terrence in and, you know, see
  if he wants to join a call. And probably better him than me as well, so. Or both
  of us, but, yeah. Okay. That''s perfect. Okay.'
- 'Me: Okie dok. Thank you very much.'
- 'Them: Let''s chill, okay? Good to see. I''ll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.'
- 'Me: Bye bye now.'

So that it doesn't direct towards you. Look, this here, that. This isn't your bot. We all know that. It's an engineering based issue that is cropped up. That is not a tiered discretion. It's not within your realm of capacity to change that, and I'm happy to say that to your direct customer as well. So there won't be an email port. I can go into those calls, no problem.
- Me: Okay? I'll put that to the client. At least it gives me an option. Meghan has mentioned that before. And as I say, please. Begging. This is not a reflection on you at all. I appreciate you have been working very hard on this. And you do, no doubt with a company such as Google, you do actually get to a point said, no, you just can't. So that's just it, that's the end of the road.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: It's down to you guys, the customer facing part of the team, to actually go and explain this crazy situation to the client. But. Okay, I get it, right? I appreciate I reached the end of the road with it. I appreciate the fact, at the end of the day, we're never going to be able to do anything with this. Until such a time as the booking engine decide to engage completely with Google and expose those landing pages. Ultimately the responsibility that now is going to lie with them, and the solution to this is more likely to come from them than from you. To do this properly, for want of a better description, and that might help escalate that process. But again, they're a big beast as well. Whether they decide to do that or not is down to their miss out of my hands. So I appreciate you coming on the call. Thank you very much indeed.
- Them: Of course, I got a lot better. I wish we were able to say, look, we can fix this. Unfortunately, that's not the position we're in, but absolutely. If there is a call with the customer and they were like Mr. Joan, just let me know you have my email. Let me know I'm with my tear to jump on and let them know what the status is and how it doesn't impact you.
- Me: All right. Okay, wonderful. Thank you very much. Appreciate you jumping on the last minute there as well, Terry.
- Them: 're all good. Okay. What I do is I'll let it go. I'll drop off for now. But again, Peter, hopefully I hear from you soon.
- Me: Wonderful. Thanks. Sorry.
- Them: See you later. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
- Me: Thanks, Megan. Appreciate that. As I say, it's not a reflection on you.
- Them: Roys. Yeah.
- Me: You worked hard on this, but we're up against a brick wall, aren't we?
- Them: Yes.
- Me: So I'll transmit this to the client and see what they come back with if they wanted to jump on a call. It's going to be the same conclusion anyway. And that's what I'll like them now.
- Them: Y. Es.
- Me: Nothing's going to change. Unless, as I say, the only way it's going to change is if they're booking engine change. The way in which they work.
- Them: Yeah, exactly. I'm. Look, I think obviously not as impacted as you, but I am also frustrated because. It's like as you said. The issue was on our side, and the solution isn't on our side either. But again, it's kind of all we can do for now. Is there anything like we have a couple of minutes or half up until three minutes passes or anything else? Okay.
- Me: I'm going to spend the next five minutes just drafting an email to Devonshire, and then I can get them up about then.
- Them: Yeah, and just say, like, you can even CC Terrence in and, you know, see if he wants to join a call. And probably better him than me as well, so. Or both of us, but, yeah. Okay. That's perfect. Okay.
- Me: Okie dok. Thank you very much.
- Them: Let's chill, okay? Good to see. I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.
- Me: Bye bye now.

--- Enhanced Notes ---
### Google Ads Issue Status Update

- Meeting with Megan and Terry (Google team) regarding ongoing Devonshire campaign issue
- Scheduling confusion: Peter didn’t receive calendar invite for 10:30 time change

### Campaign Problem Background

- Google created original hotel Performance Max Beta campaigns for Devonshire
- Google subsequently removed landing page URLs from campaigns (not Peter’s action)
- Peter cannot restore URLs - lacks technical access/capability
- Issue impacts campaign performance but Google won’t prioritize fix

### Google’s Response and Escalation Efforts

- Megan escalated through multiple channels:
- Support supervisors
- Product teams
- Engineering teams
- Executive escalation
- All escalation attempts exhausted
- Engineering team verdict: insufficient revenue impact to warrant resources
- No timeline provided for future fix

### Client Communication Challenge

- Peter must explain to Devonshire that:
- Google created the issue
- Google won’t fix due to spending levels not warranting engineering time
- Responsibility shifts unfairly to consultant
- Requested official Google email declined - against company policy
- Terry offered to join client calls to explain situation directly

### Alternative Solutions and Next Steps

- Only viable solution: Devonshire’s booking engine must expose landing pages to Google
- Booking engine changes outside Peter’s control
- Client communication options:
1. Terry joins client call to explain Google’s position
2. Peter drafts email to Devonshire explaining situation
- Can CC Terry for potential client call scheduling

Me: Pull in the european rsa descriptions. In from the. Direct place. In the Google Ads account via the Google Ads API. And populate the spreadsheets. That's just the descriptions for the European account. Peugeot. Ormskit.
Them: Hello. By. E.
Me: Hi, megan.
Them: Peter, this is like 45 minutes after the start time, so I don't know if I can see if my manager is available to join. Because it was at 10.
Me: Yeah. I didn't get an email from you, Megan, about changing the time. You said change the time. I didn't get an invite for the link or anything, so apologies.
Them: I sent you one. I said, Is 10:30 tomorrow okay? And you said, that's fine. So I just thought it was fine.
Me: All right. Okay. Usually you send another email with it, an invite on it, so it's okay. Whatever. That's why at all. That's how it lands in my calendar.
Them: Seven. Okay? Oh, maybe it didn't reflect. In a new calendar. Sorry about that. That was just a miscommunication. But are you okay that this call is reported?
Me: Yep, no problem.
Them: Perfect. Okay. So. Yeah, ideally, obviously, as I said, I would have preferred if Terrence is here just to explain what happened with the case. I'm just kind of ping him now to see if he's free. One second. But how was Eddie here? Black Friday campaign started to go. Clear.
Me: It was all right. It wasn't. It didn't blow me away this year. Black Friday.
Them: No.
Me: There was one client who did particularly well, but that was in the US. So the UK was a bit lackless to really.
Them: Really okay.
Me: Don't know why. It's the first time, really. I've gone nuts with making changes to roas and budgets and so on. Usually I make sure there's enough budget, but I've dropped brass targets this year. Instinct to make any difference still, which was very odd. And that's across a few clients as well.
Them: We do have high hopes for December as well. So obviously this isn't related to necessarily.
Me: Yeah. We always have high hopes for December.
Them: We do always have. That's very true. But I can share this with you just in terms of what we expect to see. Obviously it's not as applicable for Devonshire, but you can see some of the days where Super Saturday last year was like 15% bigger than the year before. And we expect. We anticipate that or. Sorry. 37% I overshot, but 8% December was bigger than the year previous. So we are anticipating that it will. There is more opportunity that we could take advantage of. And yeah, it might be something. And one thing I recommend is even if there's any kind of gift vouchers available, if that's something that you could provide, we see that to quite well as well. So that's like. That doesn't need to have anything to do with like last shipment date. You can sell gift factories until you know the end of time. So that's completely sea work quite well, but I'll share that with you anyway. And hopefully.
Me: Yeah. Great. Thank you.
Them: Perfect. So. Yeah. And then on the case, I think what we're gonna explain today is that, like, we've done everything that we possibly could to get it resolved. It's been sent to the product team, it's been sent to engineers. We've had executive escalation. We've had, you know. One of the heads of support look into it, and it's just the revenue impact of the issue isn't high enough for them to change it, which I know is very disappointing, but that's. That's all that we can do.
Me: It's very demeaning to tell that to Devonshire as well. That's going to be quite interesting.
Them: Yeah.
Me: They're not worth enough to Google to be able to fix it. And the frustrating thing, as I've said before, is you did it in the first place. You actually created those campaigns.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It wasn't me. It wasn't me that did it. And it's you that removed those links from those campaigns. It wasn't me.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So. And then to actually say not to take responsibility for it. And to say it's not worth our while financially to rectify the mistake that we've made. I think is very poor.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: That's the summation of it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You know, and I just think, you know, I think you're just treating them very, very badly.
Them: No, I, I, I agreed. I, I do appreciate where you're coming from, but I think it was more to explain, like what we've done with this is all that we can do and.
Me: Yeah, but. Yeah, but it's not. It's not all you can do. Because what you. What you've just said is that it's not financially worth your while.
Them: It. 's.
Me: To do anymore. And that's frustrating bit.
Them: S.
Me: Especially when, as I say, you had the expertise in the first place to create these campaigns. You had the expertise. To. To actually. Sorry. You had the expertise to actually create this in the first place. And yet now it's not financially viable for you. To spend the time technically to fix it. I don't get it. I really don't. And it's a very embarrassing thing for me to say to the client that Google don't actually think you're spending enough money to be able to warrant a fix to it. That's. That's the translation for it.
Them: In. Peter, look, thank you first, just for. For kicking this off first. And again with what?
Me: Apologies. Should have messed it up with the timing.
Them: Now. Not. Not at all. Peter, don't. Don't worry about it.
Me: Sorry.
Them: I think. I'll give you context. So Megan obviously shared the situation that you've gone through the back and forth with the support teams and maybe make it likely hasn't given you all of the context in the work that she's done on it. But normally.
Me: Oh, I noticed. Worked hard on it, terry. That's fine. Yeah.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Normally what we would do is we would pass on the feedback to our support teams and they would. They would take care of it.
Me: That goes. Without. Saying.
Them: Megan's managed to work with the Aramibe supervisors. She's then also managed to bring to the product teams and the engineering teams, which is a long step away from what we would normally do. So, look, from Megan's perspective, she's done a huge amount of trying to get this over the line in order to move it. Immigration, not just targeted for you and for your client. Ultimately, it hasn't resulted in the fits that you want. And the after we have put all the hands up and acknowledge that. Too, for complete transparency on it. Where it sits at the moment is that from a resourcing perspective, we don't have people that can work on everything. It's not that they won't get to fixing this. It's that for the moment, in terms of the resources that we have from an engineering point of view. We spend a lot of our time with the vast majority on the time working on the things that are having a large impact across more and more customers. And that's currently where it sits. And again, look, I know that's not. What you want. Ideally, it's not what we want either, to be honest. We prepare for low stakes and just make this easier. But ultimately where it sits at the moment is that the engineering team just don't have capacity to be able to make fix in this instance again. It may be fixed in future, but there's giving no timeline. And based on the updates that Megan's got from the engineering team, they said, look, we understand that the issue is in place, but ultimately, we don't have capacity to make a change for now.
Me: And as I. As I've just explained, this campaign was created by you. By when I say you, I mean google.
Them: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Specific blame to anybody at all. But it was. It was created by you initially as part of the original hotel's pmax Beta. So it was created by you. The landing pages were removed by you. It wasn't me. I. I know no means by which I can actually do that. And I have to explain to the client now that that is the case. And that despite the fact that it's you that's removed the URLs, you're not going to. You're not going to do anything about it because of resource. I get that. But also because Devonshire aren't spending enough money. With you. To warrant it going higher up in the list. It's not been prioritized at all because it's a mistake that's been made by Google. It's just been put into the usual mix of is this financially worth our while to do it? No, it isn't. It's nothing at all. And the implications for me is a consultant are massive. I have to take responsibility for this. And to say this to the client. They go. What do you mean? That doesn't make any sense at all, that you don't take responsibility for your actions. It just goes back in the mix again as to what the financial burden is to Google to actually do this, and that's a really tough one. Really tough one. I mean, what I would like for and I can't change anything. I get it. It's a big beast. What I would like is I would like an official email from Google to give to the client. So that it diverts. Everything away from me. I can't do anything. I can't do any more about this. But I would like an official explanation. In an email that I can forward onto the clients. As to. As to what the situation is. No, this isn't a great thing. I think it's not necessarily the financial impact to the client. Their general dealings with Google are just going to be soured greatly as a result of this. No, they won't stop spending money with you because this is a great source of their income. But it just takes a knock, really leaves a sour taste in the mouth. So if you could do that for me, I would really appreciate that.
Them: Look, what I say on that is there won't be an email. And look, there won't be an email because Automate, that's just not within the rules of principle that the company has. So they won't write an email in order to say so. That can be passed on. What I can do, though, is, look, I can join those calls. I can meet with customers and I can explain the perspective. So that it doesn't direct towards you. Look, this here, that. This isn't your bot. We all know that. It's an engineering based issue that is cropped up. That is not a tiered discretion. It's not within your realm of capacity to change that, and I'm happy to say that to your direct customer as well. So there won't be an email port. I can go into those calls, no problem.

I appreciate you have been working very hard on this. And you do, no doubt with a company such as Google, you do actually get to a point said, no, you just can't. So that's just it, that's the end of the road.
Them: Yes.
