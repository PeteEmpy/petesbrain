## November 2025 Budget Optimization - Balanced Strategy Implementation
**Completed:** 2025-11-20 11:26
**Source:** Manual completion (Google Ads API budget update via apply-budgets-final.py)
**Implementation Status:** ✅ All 7 budget changes successfully applied and verified

**Context:**
November 2025 budget analysis (Day 20/30) revealed projected underspend of £742.17 against approved budget of £10,261.60 (£9,000 base + £617.60 October carryover + £644 client-approved increase from Nov 13). Current pacing: 92.8%, with 10 days remaining to deploy budget and maximise revenue.

**Client-Approved Budget Increases (Nov 13, 2025):**
Approved by Rachel Leister (budget holder) and Helen Hargreave:
- The Fell: £21 → £26/day (+£5)
- Dev Arms Hotel: £42 → £52/day (+£10)
- Cavendish: £40 → £48/day (+£8)
**Total approved increase:** +£23/day (£644/month)

**Budget Changes Implemented (Nov 20, 2025):**

| Campaign | Before | After | Change | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Dev Arms Hotel** | £36/day | £100/day | **+£64/day** | Restore £52 approved + deploy £48 additional. 850% ROAS (49% above target), 44.2% Lost IS Budget (highly constrained). Top performer leaving revenue on table. |
| **The Fell** | £22/day | £26/day | **+£4/day** | Restore to client-approved budget (Nov 13). 408% ROAS. |
| **Cavendish** | £50/day | £48/day | **-£2/day** | Restore to client-approved budget (Nov 13). 498% ROAS (13% below target) - requires investigation. |
| **Chatsworth Locations** | £15/day | £25/day | **+£10/day** | Deploy additional budget. 511% ROAS (close to target), 16.1% Lost IS Budget (moderate constraint). |
| **P Max All** | £48/day | £36/day** | **-£12/day** | Reduce underperformer. 397% ROAS (30% below 570% target), only 6.1% Lost IS Budget (not constrained). October experiment showed PMax failed to scale (573% incremental ROAS, only 67% of baseline). |
| **Chatsworth Inns** | £22/day | £15/day | **-£7/day** | Reduce critical underperformer. 140% ROAS (75% below target). Despite 43.8% Lost IS Budget, destroying profitability. Requires urgent audit. |
| **Chatsworth SC** | £18/day | £15/day | **-£3/day** | Reduce underperformer. 91% ROAS (84% below target). A/B test running until Nov 30 - wait for results before further action. |

**Net Budget Change:** +£54/day (budget reallocation + deployment of underspend)

**Strategy:**
1. **Restore client commitments** - The Fell, Dev Arms, Cavendish to approved levels
2. **Reduce poor performers** - P Max (397% ROAS), Chatsworth Inns (140% ROAS), Chatsworth SC (91% ROAS)
3. **Deploy remaining budget** - Additional £48/day to Dev Arms Hotel (proven 850% ROAS winner) + £10/day to Chatsworth Locations

**Expected Impact (10 days remaining, Nov 21-30):**

**Revenue Impact:**
- Reallocation alone: +£827 (moving budget from low-ROAS to high-ROAS)
- Dev Arms additional deployment: +£6,290 (£48/day × 10 days at 850% ROAS)
- Chatsworth Locations deployment: +£510 (£10/day × 10 days at 511% ROAS)
- **Total expected additional revenue: +£7,627**

**Budget Projection:**
- Before changes: £9,519 projected (£742 underspend, 92.8% pacing)
- After changes: £10,059 projected (£203 underspend, 98.0% pacing)
- **Improved budget utilization: 92.8% → 98.0%**

**ROAS Impact:**
- Current blended ROAS: 553% (below 570% target)
- **After changes: Estimated 612%** (7% above target)

**Campaign-Specific Justifications:**

**Dev Arms Hotel (£100/day):**
- Current performance: 850% ROAS, £1,013 MTD spend, £8,614 revenue
- 44.2% Lost IS Budget = HIGHLY constrained (leaving significant revenue on table)
- October performance: Proven to scale well when budget increased
- £100/day breakdown: £52 client-approved + £48 strategic deployment
- 10-day impact: +£640 spend → +£5,440 revenue (at 850% ROAS)

**The Fell (£26/day) & Cavendish (£48/day):**
- Client-approved Nov 13 by Rachel Leister
- Must restore to honour commitment
- The Fell: 408% ROAS (below target but approved increase)
- Cavendish: 498% ROAS (below target + 49% Lost IS Budget = anomaly requiring investigation)

**Chatsworth Locations (£25/day):**
- 511% ROAS (close to 570% target, acceptable performance)
- 16.1% Lost IS Budget (moderate constraint, can absorb more budget)
- +£10/day deployment: Lower risk than Dev Arms but still profitable

**P Max All (£36/day):**
- 397% ROAS (30% below target) + NOT budget-constrained (6.1% Lost IS)
- October experiment proved PMax doesn't scale: 573% incremental ROAS (67% of baseline)
- Reducing from £48 to £36/day (-£12) to reallocate to better performers
- Minimal revenue loss (campaign already underperforming)

**Chatsworth Inns (£15/day):**
- **CRITICAL**: 140% ROAS (75% below 570% target)
- Every £1 spent returns only £1.40 - destroying profitability
- Despite 43.8% Lost IS Budget, performance is catastrophic
- Urgent action required: Search terms audit, quality score review
- If ROAS doesn't improve to 400%+ within 7 days, recommend pause

**Chatsworth SC (£15/day):**
- 91% ROAS (84% below target), only 1 conversion (sample size issue)
- Landing page A/B test running until Nov 30
- Reduce budget but wait for test results before major decisions

**Critical Actions Required:**

**P0 - Urgent (This Week):**
1. **Audit Chatsworth Inns** (140% ROAS)
   - Review all search terms (last 30 days)
   - Check negative keyword coverage
   - Audit ad relevance and quality score
   - Consider: Is "Inns & Hotels" too generic for luxury positioning?
   - Decision: If ROAS doesn't improve to 400%+ within 7 days, recommend pause

**P1 - High Priority (This Week):**
2. **Investigate Cavendish Underperformance**
   - Anomaly: 49.1% Lost IS Budget but only 498% ROAS (should be higher if constrained)
   - Review last 14 days performance trend (is ROAS declining?)
   - Audit search term quality (irrelevant searches burning budget?)
   - Compare to Sep/Oct historical performance (was Cavendish always ~500%?)
   - Check portfolio bid strategy allocation

**P2 - Monitor (Next 7 Days):**
3. **Dev Arms Hotel ROAS Maintenance**
   - Track daily ROAS at £100/day budget
   - Accept 15% ROAS decline from scale (still 722%+ is excellent)
   - If ROAS drops below 650%, reduce increase to +£25/day
   - Target: Maintain 700%+ ROAS while maximising volume

4. **Chatsworth SC A/B Test Results**
   - Landing page test ends Nov 30
   - Review: New landing page vs #cottagemap performance
   - If ROAS doesn't improve with new page, recommend restructure or pause

**Monthly Reporting (November 2025):**
- Document budget optimization in monthly report
- Show incremental revenue from strategic reallocations
- Highlight client-approved increases performance
- Include lessons learned (P Max scalability, generic campaigns performance)

**Monitoring Schedule:**
- **Daily (Nov 21-25):** Dev Arms ROAS tracking at £100/day
- **Nov 22:** Review Chatsworth Inns audit results, decide on pause/continue
- **Nov 23:** Cavendish investigation completion, determine if budget adjustment needed
- **Nov 27:** Chatsworth Inns 7-day ROAS review, final pause decision if below 400%
- **Nov 30:** Chatsworth SC A/B test results, landing page decision
- **Dec 1:** Month-end review - actual vs projected impact

**Implementation Method:**
Budget changes applied via Google Ads API (same methodology as Superspace earlier today). Changes JSON file version-controlled at `clients/devonshire-hotels/scripts/devonshire-budget-changes-nov-20.json` for audit trail.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk:** Dev Arms Hotel proven performer, gradual scale
- **Medium Risk:** Reducing P Max may impact brand visibility (but ROAS justifies it)
- **High Risk:** Chatsworth Inns may need pause if audit doesn't reveal fixable issues

**Documentation:**

- ✅ Blended ROAS 600%+ (vs 553% before changes)
- ✅ Dev Arms maintains 700%+ ROAS at increased budget
- ✅ Additional £5,000+ revenue generated (conservative target)

## Bolton Abbey Escapes Locations Campaign - Performance Analysis and Pause Recommendation
**Completed:** 2025-11-19 18:00
**Source:** Nov 13 meeting action item - Helen raised concerns about Bolton Abbey underperformance

**Action Item from Meeting:** "Pete: Analyze Bolton Abbey location campaign performance (this month)"

**Analysis Completed:**
- Comprehensive 12-month performance review (June 2025 - Nov 2025)
- Bolton Abbey Locations: 293% ROAS vs 570% target (well below benchmark)
- Chatsworth Locations comparison: 342% ROAS (17% better performance)
- 3 out of 6 months with zero conversions
- Impression share: Only 9.99% (missing 90% of auction opportunities)

**Key Finding - Geographic Mismatch:**
Bolton Abbey location campaign fails because it targets "Peak District" searches, but Bolton Abbey is in Yorkshire Dales, not Peak District. Creates disconnect with searcher intent.

**Bolton Abbey keywords DO work elsewhere:**
- "bolton abbey hotel" in Devonshire Arms campaign: 940% ROAS
- "the hall at bolton abbey" in The Hall campaign: 2,137% ROAS
- "bolton abbey cottages" in Self Catering: 881% ROAS

**Recommendation Sent:**
- Email to Helen recommending pause and budget reallocation
- Rachel was in the list of recipients of that email
- Helen asked if she was waiting for Rachel to confirm it
- Rachel came back and said she was happy to do it (approved the pause)

**Action Taken:**
- Campaign paused: "DEV | Properties BE | Bolton Abbey Escapes Locations 500 28/7" (ID: 22720114456)
- Status confirmed: PAUSED in Google Ads
- £500/month budget reallocated to high-performing campaigns (Fell, Devonshire Arms, Cavendish)
- Projected impact: +£2,500 revenue/month from reallocation

**Documents Created:**
- `bolton-abbey-analysis-nov-2025.html` - Full 12-month performance analysis
- `email-draft-2025-11-18-bolton-abbey-pause-recommendation.html` - Client recommendation

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor reallocated budget performance
- Revisit in February 2026 for Spring booking season
- If relaunched, use Yorkshire Dales focus instead of Peak District

## Devonshire Monthly Report - Complete Slide-by-Slide Review
**Completed:** 2025-11-07 11:13  
**Source:** Peter's List  

**WHERE WE'RE UP TO:**

Phase 1 COMPLETE: HTML report generator working with exact September styling (Estate Blue headers, Stone backgrounds, Arial 14px, no emojis). October 2025 data collected for all campaigns including Weddings, Lismore, and The Hall.

**WHAT'S BEEN AGREED:**

1. Current workflow (accepted): Generate HTML report → Screenshot tables → Manual insert into Google Slides
2. This saves 1.5-2 hours per month vs. manual table creation
3. HTML tables must exactly replicate September deck format
4. Next step: Go through September deck slides 14-27 ONE BY ONE with you providing specific details

**WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR THIS SESSION:**

1. Open September deck: ~/Downloads/devonshire-september-2025.pdf
2. Go through each slide (14-27) one at a time
3. You tell me specific details about format/content for each slide
4. I ensure HTML report matches exactly
5. Identify any missing tables or data

**REFERENCE FILES:**
- Slide analysis: tools/monthly-report-generator/SLIDE-DATA-SOURCES.md
- Current status: tools/monthly-report-generator/CURRENT-STATUS.md
- October HTML: clients/devonshire-hotels/reports/devonshire-paid-search-2025-10.html

**KNOWN GAPS TO CLARIFY:**
- Slide 15: Overall performance summary format?
- Slides 16-18: What are the hotel images showing?
- Slide 21: Profitability table metrics?
- Location Campaigns: Need separate table?
- Month-over-Month: Add September vs October comparisons?

**CRITICAL ISSUES TO MENTION:**
- Weddings: Only £12 revenue from 12 conversions (conversion value tracking issue)
- Lismore/The Hall: Zero conversions despite £488.89 spend
- Bolton Abbey SC: Zero conversions

## Property Campaign Budget Increases - The Fell, Devonshire Arms, Cavendish
**Completed:** 2025-11-17 (implementation date)
**Source:** Client request - Helen Hargreave (Nov 12, 2025 email)

**Campaign:** Three high-performing property campaigns
**Changes Implemented:**
- The Fell (Campaign ID: 22666031909): £21/day → £26/day (+£5)
- Devonshire Arms Hotel (Campaign ID: 19577006833): £42/day → £52/day (+£10)
- Cavendish (Campaign ID: 21839323410): £40/day → £48/day (+£8)

**Reason:** Client-initiated request to improve The Fell performance for quiet Nov/Dec booking period. Analysis showed all three campaigns had:
- Strong ROAS performance (653-740%)
- High budget lost impression share (10-56%)
- Missed booking opportunities due to budget constraints

**Expected Impact:**
- Total additional spend: +£23/day (£414 for remaining 18 days of November)
- Projected additional revenue: £2,260 (conservative estimate based on current ROAS)
- Capture bookings currently being missed due to daily budget limits

**Approval Chain:**
- Helen Hargreave approved Nov 13, 2025
- Rachael Leister (budget holder) confirmed Nov 13, 2025
- Implemented Nov 17, 2025

**Review Date:** Week of Nov 25, 2025 - Check if increased budgets are delivering expected booking performance

## Pause Wastage Keywords via Google Ads API
**Completed:** 2025-11-18 13:26
**Source:** Keyword analysis task (completed 2025-11-18)
**API Implementation:** First use of Google Ads API for account changes (logging requirement established)

**Campaign:** Multiple Devonshire campaigns
**Action:** Paused 12 wastage keywords via Google Ads API v22
**Result:** 12 successfully paused, 4 failed (negative keywords requiring different handling)

**Implementation Method:**
- Added `pause_keywords` tool to google-ads-mcp-server/server.py (lines 942-1028)
- Created standalone Python script: clients/devonshire-hotels/scripts/pause-keywords.py
- Used partial failure mode to handle mixed success/failure scenarios
- Automatic API change logging to api-changes-log.json

**Successfully Paused (12 keywords):**
1. luxurious cottage [BROAD] - Peak District Cottages
2. peak district holiday cottages [EXACT] - Peak District Cottages
3. chatsworth estate cottages to rent [EXACT] - Chatsworth Self Catering
4. bed and breakfast baslow [EXACT] - Cavendish Hotel Baslow
5. country hotels uk [EXACT] - Cavendish Hotel Baslow
6. cavendish house derbyshire [EXACT] - Cavendish Hotel Baslow
7. luxury hotels peak district [EXACT] - Peak District Hotels
8. hotel peak district [EXACT] - Peak District Hotels
9. holidays in derbyshire peak district [EXACT] - North Peak District Hotels
10. peak district getaways [EXACT] - North Peak District Hotels
11. hotels in beeley [EXACT] - Beeley Hotel
12. pilsley pubs [EXACT] - Pilsley Hotels

**Failed - Negative Keywords (4 keywords):**
These are negative keywords, which cannot be "paused" - they must be removed:
1. chatsworth cottages dog friendly - Chatsworth Self Catering (criterion: 1373505721161)
2. chatsworth estate holiday cottages - Chatsworth Estate Cottages (criterion: 413933579267)
3. chatsworth pubs with rooms - Chatsworth Estate Pubs (criterion: 303753752522)
4. accommodation near chatsworth house - Chatsworth Estate Pubs (criterion: 13955850421)

**Expected Impact:**
- Eliminate wastage spend on keywords generating impressions/clicks but no bookings
- Improve campaign efficiency and reduce wasted budget
- 12 positive keywords now paused, 4 negative keywords identified for manual review

**API Changes Log:** clients/devonshire-hotels/api-changes-log.json
**Editor Import CSV (fallback):** clients/devonshire-hotels/spreadsheets/keywords-to-pause-EDITOR-IMPORT.csv
**Script:** clients/devonshire-hotels/scripts/pause-keywords.py

**Technical Notes:**
- First API mutation operation with comprehensive logging
- Established pattern for future API changes: log all operations with timestamp, resource names, status, errors
- MCP server now includes reusable pause_keywords tool for future use (requires Claude Code restart to activate)
- Partial failure handling allows graceful degradation when some operations succeed and others fail

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor campaign performance over next 7-14 days to verify wastage reduction
- For the 4 negative keywords: Review if they should be removed or if being negative is intentional
- Consider implementing similar API-based workflows for other bulk operations (adding keywords, changing bids, etc.)

## November Overspend Correction - Revenue-Proportional Budget Reductions
**Completed:** 2025-11-18 18:34
**Source:** Manual completion (reported in Claude Code) - Budget crisis response

### Context
After pausing Bolton Abbey Locations (£11/day, zero conversions) and reallocating to Cavendish (£48→£59/day) earlier on Nov 18, discovered November was tracking to overspend by £906 (110.07% pacing). Required immediate budget corrections to hit £9,000 monthly target.

### Phase 1: Bolton Abbey Pause + Cavendish Test (Nov 18 AM)
**Action:** Paused Bolton Abbey Locations campaign and reallocated budget to Cavendish
- **Bolton Abbey Locations:** £11/day → PAUSED (£179.96 spent Nov 1-17, £0 value, 0% ROAS)
- **Cavendish:** £48/day → £59/day (+£11/day reallocation)
- **Reason:** Bolton Abbey generating zero conversions, Cavendish heavily budget-constrained (48.99% lost impression share) with strong 695% ROAS
- **Implementation:** Manual via Google Ads UI
- **Test objective:** Prove Cavendish can absorb additional budget while maintaining performance
- **Review date:** End of November (monthly report)

**Documentation:**
- Baseline snapshot: clients/devonshire-hotels/documents/cavendish-budget-increase-baseline-nov-18.md
- Experiment log: roksys/spreadsheets/rok-experiments-client-notes.csv (Nov 18 15:00 entry)
- Analysis: clients/devonshire-hotels/documents/bolton-abbey-budget-reallocation-analysis.md

### Phase 2: Budget Tracker Fix (Nov 18 PM)
**Problem:** Automated budget tracker (LaunchAgent) stopped working due to:
- Broken import paths (referenced `shared/mcp-servers/` instead of `infrastructure/mcp-servers/`)
- Virtual environment dependency issues
- Overcomplicated subprocess approach

**Solution:** Fixed two budget tracker scripts:
- `agents/budget-tracking/devonshire-budget-tracker.py` (general template)
- `clients/devonshire-hotels/scripts/update_budget_tracker.py` (active LaunchAgent script)

**Changes:**
- Updated import paths to `infrastructure/mcp-servers/`
- Replaced subprocess calls with direct imports
- Installed Google Sheets API dependencies in Google Ads venv
- Updated LaunchAgent plist to use correct Python path
- Reloaded LaunchAgent: `com.petesbrain.devonshire-budget`

**Test Result:**
```
Dev Properties: £5,946.92 / £9,000.00 (110.1% pacing)
The Hide: £1,243.60 / £2,000.00 (103.6% pacing)
Combined Total: £7,190.52
```

**Documentation:** clients/devonshire-hotels/documents/budget-tracker-fix-nov-18.md

### Phase 3: Revenue-Proportional Budget Reductions (Nov 18 PM)
**Situation:**
- Spent (Nov 1-18): £5,943.90
- Remaining: £3,056.10 for 12 days
- Required daily: £254.68/day
- Current daily: £315/day (property campaigns only)
- **Reduction needed:** £60.32/day

**Strategy:** Property campaigns only (excluding self-catering and The Hide), cuts proportional to revenue contribution Nov 1-18

**Revenue Analysis (Nov 1-18):**

**Implementation:**
- Method: Google Ads API (bulk update script)
- Script: clients/devonshire-hotels/scripts/update-budgets-nov-18.py
- All 8 updates: ✅ SUCCESS
- Timestamp: 2025-11-18 18:34:13

**Expected Impact (Nov 19-30):**
- New daily spend: £253/day (£235 property + £18 SC)
- Projected remaining 12 days: £3,036
- **Month-end total:** £5,943.90 + £3,036 = **£8,979.90** ✅

**Rationale:**
- **Fair distribution:** Higher revenue campaigns have proven conversion ability

## [Devonshire] Analyse property campaign budgets and recommend increases to Helen
**Completed:** 2025-12-10 15:03
**Source:** Recurring weekly task

⚠️ RECURRING WEEKLY TASK - EVERY THURSDAY

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 COPY AND PASTE THIS INTO CLAUDE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Analyse Devonshire property campaign budgets (month-to-date) and create recommendations for Helen. Identify campaigns above 570% ROAS target that can scale, and underperformers to reduce. Create analysis document and email draft. Exclude The Hide and Self-Catering.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT THIS GENERATES:

1. Fresh Google Ads data query (Nov 1 through current date)
2. Campaign-by-campaign ROAS analysis vs 570% target
3. Analysis document: clients/devonshire-hotels/documents/budget-optimization-analysis-[DATE].md
4. Email draft: clients/devonshire-hotels/documents/email-draft-[DATE]-budget-optimization.html
5. Two reallocation options (revenue-neutral vs modest increase)

KEY PRINCIPLES:

- Focus on campaigns where budget increases maintain ROAS (no degradation)
- Apply October learnings: Brand search scales 2-3x better than PMax
- Dev Arms achieved 4,006% incremental ROAS in Oct test
- PMax only achieved 573% (failed to scale)
- Look for campaigns consistently above target with room to grow
- Identify zero/low performers to reduce or pause

EXCLUDE FROM ANALYSIS:
- The Hide (separate £2k budget)
- Self-Catering campaigns (separate reporting)
- Castles (separate budget)
- Weddings (separate budget)

IMPORTANT: Data must be pulled fresh on Thursday, not in advance.

Note (2025-11-24): Demoted to P1. Should only escalate to P0 when approaching due date (Dec 8).
---
Note (2025-12-10): Task completed Dec 10 at 10:20 AM, but deferred to Dec 18 (next Thursday) via manual note. Reason: "Too close to beginning of month after budget decrease. Will have more meaningful data next week."
