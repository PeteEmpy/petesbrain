## Strategic Context

### 📝 Campaign Naming Convention (Nov 2025)

**Campaign names updated to reflect reporting structure**:
- **Core Properties** = Main hotel campaigns (Devonshire Arms, Cavendish, Beeley, Pilsley, Fell, Chatsworth Inns, P Max, Chatsworth Locations)
  - Campaign names contain: "DEV | Core Properties"
- **Self Catering Properties** = Self-catering campaigns (Chatsworth SC, Bolton Abbey SC)
  - Campaign names contain: "DEV | Self Catering Properties"
- **Venues** = Exclusive venues (Lismore, The Hall) - formerly called "Castles"
  - Campaign names contain: "DEV | Venues"
- **The Hide** = Separate property with own £2,000 budget (intentionally NOT "Core Properties")
  - Campaign name: "DEV | Properties CE | The Hide"
- **Weddings** = Wedding campaigns
  - Campaign name: "DEV | Weddings"

**Reporting Terminology**:
- Use "Core Properties" not "main hotels" or "main properties"
- Use "Venues" not "Castles"
- Use "Self Catering Properties" not "self-catering campaigns"

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Hide / Highwayman Property

**The Hide and The Highwayman are THE SAME PROPERTY**

- **Property Name Change**: Renamed from "The Highwayman" to "The Hide" on **October 10, 2025**
- **Campaign IDs to Track Together**:
  - `23069490466` - "DEV | Properties CE | The Hide" (ENABLED - current)
  - `21815704991` - "DEV | Properties | Highwayman Arms" (PAUSED - historical)
- **Budget**: £2,000/month (separate from main Dev Properties budget)
- **Why This Matters**: When analyzing spend, conversions, or performance:
  - ALWAYS combine both campaign IDs
  - ALWAYS include paused campaigns (they have historical spend/conversion data)
  - Budget tracker automatically combines both campaigns

**Mentioned in**:
- Experiment log: 10/10/2025 "The Hide Hotel campaign live"
- Account structure doc: [google-ads-account-structure.md](documents/google-ads-account-structure.md:27)

### Current Strategy

**Monthly Meeting Timing** (Nov 2025 change):
- **NEW**: Meetings moved to first week of month (previously mid-month)
- **Reason**: Mid-month meetings limit ability to implement changes for current month
- **Benefit**: Allows full month of optimization based on previous month's data
- **Agreed with**: Helen (Nov 13, 2025 meeting)

**Budget Reporting Structure** (Nov 2025):
- **Core Properties**: £9,000/month (campaigns with "Core Properties" in name - excludes The Hide, Venues, Weddings)
- **The Hide**: £2,000/month (separate £2k budget, intentionally not named "Core Properties")
- **Self Catering Properties**: £1,000/month (campaigns with "Self Catering Properties" in name)
- **Weddings**: Separate budget (lead generation campaigns)
- **Venues**: Separate budget (Lismore, The Hall - exclusive venues, formerly called "Castles")

**Performance Philosophy** (from client feedback):
- Focus on quality bookings and profitability, not volume
- Target ROAS: 570% (portfolio bid strategy across campaigns)
- October 2025: Increased from 550% to 570% to slow spend and hit budget targets
- Strong performers (Devonshire, Fell) consistently exceed targets (713-857% ROAS)

### Why This Approach?

**Intent-Based Marketing Strategy**:
- Campaigns respond to searcher intent, not push branding
- Text assets match search terms (e.g., "Devonshire Fell" shown to those searching for it)
- Click-through rates validate approach (going "through the roof" per Nov 13 meeting)
- Performance Max pulls relevant assets based on user signals, doesn't push brand messages

**Seasonal Context Recognition**:
- September 2025 inflated by Hotel of the Year award (Cavendish/Chatsworth campaigns)
- 94% of October decline attributed to those two campaigns specifically
- October 22% revenue drop matches 2024 seasonal pattern (expected)
- Year-over-year metrics remain strong: conversions up, CTR improving

### Goals & KPIs

**Primary Goal**: Profitable hotel bookings and qualified leads for premium countryside escapes
**Target ROAS**: 570% (as of October 2025)
**Target CPA**: Not currently tracked (focus on ROAS)

**Other KPIs**:
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Improving year-over-year (Oct 2025 vs Oct 2024)
- **Conversion Rate**: Up year-over-year
- **Budget Compliance**: Hit monthly targets (Oct 2025: 91.87% pacing ✅)
- **Average Booking Value**: The Hide averaging £510 (multiple days)

## Budget Tracking

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Always reference the [Budget Tracking Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hfshBOXryp0LYuU40kE9HKHQocoinfpXZH8TL6Me7Yc/edit#gid=0) when analyzing account performance. **The current month's row is the most important data point.**

**Spreadsheet ID**: `1hfshBOXryp0LYuU40kE9HKHQocoinfpXZH8TL6Me7Yc`

### Automated Budget Sheets (NEW - Oct 30, 2025)

The spreadsheet now includes **automated tracking sheets** that pull live data from Google Ads MCP:

1. **"Dev Properties Auto"** - Main properties budget (excluding The Hide)
2. **"The Hide Properties Auto"** - Separate £2,000/month budget tracking

**To update:** Simply ask Claude Code: "Update Devonshire budget tracker"

Data automatically includes:
- Current month spend from Google Ads
- Campaign-level breakdowns
- Pacing calculations
- Yesterday's spend
- Budget predictions

See documentation: `documents/budget-tracker-workflow.md`

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Issues

**1. CRITICAL: Performance Max Campaign Underperformance (Ongoing)**
- **Problem**: PMax campaign performance issues remain unresolved - **Pilsley and Beeley asset groups non-functioning**
- **Root Cause**: Google appears to have deleted the original working configuration with no backup, unable to recreate
- **Context**: October 2025 budget increase experiment showed PMax failed to scale effectively (573% incremental ROAS, only 67% of baseline performance)
- **Impact**: Budget allocation inefficiency, underperforming campaigns blocking optimization strategy
- **Client Frustration**: Significant client frustration due to ongoing unresolved issues (client meeting scheduled Friday Nov 15)

**Escalation Timeline:**
- **Oct 3, 2025**: Asset groups went completely offline (last activity Oct 2)
  - Verified via API: Zero impressions, clicks, conversions from Oct 3 onwards
  - Root cause: Google appears to have deleted working configuration with no backup
- **Case Opened**: ~Oct 25, 2025 (identified during routine performance review, 3 weeks after failure)
- **Nov 3, 2025**: Meeting with Megan Durand (Google rep) - No update available

### Recurring Challenges

**1. Bolton Abbey Escapes Underperformance** (Identified Nov 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: Bolton Abbey Escapes significantly underperforming vs Chatsworth Escapes
- **Budget**: ~£500/month needs reallocation or optimization
- **Action Required**: Analyze 12-month performance trends, optimize targeting
- **Considerations**: Yorkshire Dales/national park focus, location-based targeting
- **Timeline**: Analysis needed this month (November 2025)
- **Context**: May need to reallocate budget to better-performing campaigns

**2. Devonshire Fell vs The Fell Branding** (Discussed Nov 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: Ongoing debate about transitioning from "Devonshire Fell" to "The Fell" branding
- **Current State**: Only 1 of 15 headlines uses "Devonshire Fell"
- **Search Volume**: Zero searches for "Devonshire Fell" in last 30 days
- **Client Concern**: Fear of brand confusion as property transitions to "The Fell"
- **Strategy**: Intent-based marketing - show "Devonshire Fell" only to those searching for it
- **Next Step**: CMG to analyze search volume trends for both terms
- **Decision**: Will transition ads when search volume data supports it

**3. The Hide Operational Challenges** (Nov 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: Staffing issues causing inconsistent service quality
- **Impact**: May affect conversion rates and customer satisfaction
- **Context**: Property still in early operational phase (launched Oct 10)
- **Marketing Impact**: Performance improving despite operational challenges

### External Factors to Monitor

**1. Seasonal Patterns**
- September inflated by Hotel of the Year award (expect annual anomaly)
- October typically sees 22% revenue decline vs September (normal seasonality)
- Year-over-year performance remains strong indicator of account health

**2. Website & Booking System Changes**
- October 2024: Website changes caused tracking issues (2 weeks missing data)
- Caldera booking system issues affecting Weddings campaign asset refresh
- Conversion tracking fixed for The Hide in early November 2025 (exact date TBD from Gary)

**3. Competitive & Market Factors**
- Hotel of the Year award impact on Cavendish/Chatsworth demand
- Cavendish seeing first November decline across all channels (not just PPC)
- Peak District tourism seasonality affecting all properties

| [TBD] | [From experiment log] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| [TBD] | [From experiment log] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| [TBD] | [From experiment log] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

### Recent Experiments (from log):
- 10/10/2025 09:00,Devonshire Hotels,The Hyde Hotel campaign live.
- 20/10/2025 17:43,Devonshire Hotels,"An extra £30 per day was added to the Devonshire Arms Search campaign, and an extra £50 per day on the P Max campaign. It needs to be shown at the end of the month that these actually produced an incremental increase in revenue at the same rate as was being produced before the budget increase. "
  - **RESULT**: ✅ Dev Arms Search SUCCESS (4,006% incremental ROAS, 6x baseline); ❌ PMax FAILED (573% incremental ROAS, 67% of baseline)
  - **Analysis**: [october-budget-increase-analysis.md](documents/october-budget-increase-analysis.md)
  - **Recommendation**: Keep Dev Arms increase, reduce PMax back to original
  - **💡 KEY LEARNING FOR FUTURE**: Brand search scales 2-3x better than PMax; test incremental ROAS before committing to large increases
- 24/10/2025 06:23,Devonshire Hotels,Portfolio bid strategy across all campaigns increased target ROAS from 550 to 570 in order to slow down the spend trajectory and hit the budget

### Landing Page Experiments:

**September 17, 2025 - Chatsworth Escapes #cottagemap Change**
- **What**: Changed landing page to `https://www.chatsworthescapes.co.uk/stay/cottages/#cottagemap` (anchor link to jump to cottage list)
- **Why**: Self-catering campaigns were underperforming, attempted to reduce friction by skipping intro content
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Conversion rate +291% (0.11% → 0.43%). Traffic and AOV declines attributed to seasonality (Aug peak → Sep/Oct off-peak)
- **Key Learning**: Focus on controllable metrics (conversion rate) vs context metrics (AOV, which varies seasonally)

**October 20, 2025 - Budget Increase Experiment**
- **What**: Tested budget increases on two campaigns to assess scalability
  - Dev Arms Search: +£30/day
  - PMax All: +£50/day
- **Result**: ✅ Dev Arms SUCCESS (4,006% incremental ROAS, 6x baseline); ❌ PMax FAILED (573% incremental ROAS, 67% of baseline)
- **Key Learning - Budget Scalability by Campaign Type**:
  - **Brand search campaigns** scale much better than automated campaigns (PMax, Shopping)
  - **Test incremental ROAS**: Only increase budget if incremental ROAS ≥ 70% of baseline
  - **Priority for budget increases**: 1) Brand search, 2) Location campaigns, 3) Generic search, 4) PMax last
  - **Typical saturation points**: Brand search 2-3x spend, Generic 1.5-2x, PMax/Shopping 1.2-1.5x
- **Analysis**: [october-budget-increase-analysis.md](documents/october-budget-increase-analysis.md)

## Automated Workflows

### Monthly Paid Search Report Generation 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Status**: Phase 1 complete - HTML report generator working (Nov 2, 2025)

**⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Always use "by conversion time" metrics for all Devonshire reports:
- Use `metrics.conversions_by_conversion_date` (NOT `metrics.conversions`)
- Use `metrics.conversions_value_by_conversion_date` (NOT `metrics.conversions_value`)
- This matches what client sees in Google Ads interface
- Conversions attributed to when they occurred, not when click happened

**Current Workflow** (Interim Solution - Agreed):
1. Wait until 3-5 days after month ends (data finalization)
2. Run: `cd tools/monthly-report-generator && .venv/bin/python3 generate_html_report.py --month 2025-XX`
3. Open HTML report in browser
4. Take screenshots of individual tables
5. Manually insert screenshots into Google Slides
6. Send to Gary at A Cunning Plan

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Automated data collection from Google Ads API (all campaigns)
- ✅ HTML report generator with exact September deck styling
- ✅ Brand colors: Estate Blue (#00333D) headers, Stone (#E5E3DB) backgrounds
- ✅ Arial 14px font matching September deck
- ✅ All October 2025 data collected (including Weddings, Lismore, The Hall)

**What's Next** (Scheduled: Tuesday, Nov 5, 2025):
- Slide-by-slide review of September deck (slides 14-27)
- User to provide specific details about each slide's format/content
- Ensure HTML tables exactly match September deck
- Identify any missing tables or data

**Time Savings**:
- Before: 2-3 hours per month (manual table creation, data entry, formatting)
- Current: ~30 minutes (screenshot and insert)
- Future: ~5 minutes (fully automated end-to-end)
- Annual savings so far: ~20 hours

**Documentation**:
- `tools/monthly-report-generator/CURRENT-STATUS.md` - Current progress and next steps
- `tools/monthly-report-generator/SLIDE-DATA-SOURCES.md` - September slide analysis
- `tools/monthly-report-generator/PROGRESS-SUMMARY.md` - Complete campaign reference
- `clients/devonshire-hotels/reports/devonshire-paid-search-2025-10.html` - October HTML report

**October 2025 Report**: HTML generated, ready for screenshot workflow

**Critical Issues Discovered** (To communicate to client):
- ⚠️ **Weddings**: Only £12 revenue from 12 conversions (£912 spend) - conversion value tracking issue
- ⚠️ **Lismore & The Hall**: Zero conversions despite £488.89 spend - tracking audit needed
- ⚠️ **Bolton Abbey SC**: Zero conversions despite 235 clicks

**Monthly Reporting - Key Commentary Topics** (to be added to future reports):
1. **Experiment Results**: Include summary of logged experiments and their impact
   - September: Chatsworth #cottagemap landing page change (+291% conv rate) ✅ SUCCESS
   - October: Budget increases - Dev Arms Search (+£30/day, 4,006% incremental ROAS) ✅ SUCCESS; PMax (+£50/day, 573% incremental ROAS) ❌ FAILED
   - November: AI Max rollout to all search campaigns (analysis pending)
2. **Conversion Rate Tracking**: Add month-over-month conversion rate comparison
3. **Controllable vs Context Metrics**: Separate analysis of metrics we control (conv rate, CTR, CPC) from external factors (AOV, traffic volume)
4. **Seasonal Patterns**: Document expected seasonal trends in traffic, AOV, and conversion value

**Next Usage**: November 2025 report (early December generation)

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-11-07)  

**WHERE WE'RE UP TO:**

Phase 1 COMPLETE: HTML report generator working with exact September styling (Estate Blue headers, Stone backgrounds, Arial 14px, no emojis). October 2025 data collected for all campaigns including Weddings, Lismore, and The Hall.

3. HTML tables must exactly replicate September deck format
4. Next step: Go through September deck slides 14-27 ONE BY ONE with you providing specific details

**WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR THIS SESSION:**

1. Open September deck: ~/Downloads/devonshire-september-2025.pdf
2. Go through each slide (14-27) one at a time
3. You tell me specific details about format/content for each slide
4. I ensure HTML report matches exactly
