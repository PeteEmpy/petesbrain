      "notes": "**EXPERIMENT CONTEXT:**\nThis is tracking the Chatsworth Escapes landing page A/B test that launched Nov 4, 2025. The conversion collapse coincided with the test start, affecting BOTH variants equally.\n\n**Performance Data:**\n- Nov 1-20: Only 1 conversion (\u00a3299 revenue, \u00a3330 spend, 91% ROAS)\n- Historical baseline: 0.43% CR\n- Current: 0.14% CR\n\n**Other Campaigns (Benchmarks):**\n\u2705 Bolton Abbey Self Catering: Converting normally (542% ROAS, 3 conversions)\n\u2705 All hotel campaigns: Converting normally (49+ conversions)\n\u274c Chatsworth showing lower conversion volume\n\n**A/B TEST STATUS:**\n- **Started:** Nov 4, 2025\n- **Ends:** Nov 30, 2025 (30-day test)\n- **Key Finding:** BOTH variants performing equally poorly (suggests issue isn't the landing page variants)\n- **Critical:** DO NOT kill test early - self-catering has long booking lead times (need full 30 days for conversion lag)\n\n**INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES:**\n\n1. **Availability Issues** (HIGH PRIORITY)\n   - EMAIL SENT: Gary contacted Nov 20 to check Chatsworth website/availability\n   - EXPECTED RESPONSE: Nov 21\n   - Question: Did Chatsworth properties go offline, sell out, or have pricing changes around Nov 4?\n\n2. **Technical Issues**\n   - Are there Chatsworth-specific site issues affecting both variants?\n   - Check booking flow, form submissions, payment processing\n\n3. **Seasonal Factors**\n   - Nov is traditionally slower for self-catering bookings\n   - Compare to Nov 2024 performance for Chatsworth\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\n\n**Immediate (Nov 21):**\n- Receive Gary's response on availability/website changes\n- If availability issue found: Pause campaign OR reduce budget until resolved\n\n**Ongoing (Nov 21-30):**\n- Continue monitoring BOTH A/B test variants\n- Do NOT make changes that invalidate the test\n- Track daily: impressions, clicks, CTR, bounce rate, conversion rate\n\n**Final Analysis (Dec 1):**\n- Compare full 30-day results for both landing page variants\n- Account for booking lead time lag (some Nov conversions may attribute in Dec)\n- Determine if conversion collapse was due to:\n  a) Availability/external factors (not test-related)\n  b) Landing page changes (both variants equally bad)\n  c) Seasonal drop (compare to 2024)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- If availability issue: Resolve and retest\n- If landing page issue: Revert to original page\n- If seasonal: Accept lower Nov performance, revisit Dec/Jan\n\n**Note:** This task combines investigation + experiment tracking since both are intertwined.",
