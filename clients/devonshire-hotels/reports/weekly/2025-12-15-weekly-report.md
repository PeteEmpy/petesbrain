## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. **[P0 CRITICAL] Investigate Pilsley Inn Zero Conversions**

**Issue:** Pilsley Inn campaign spending £169.31/week with zero conversions for two consecutive weeks

**Impact:**
- £677/month wasted spend if tracking issue or poor targeting continues
- Previous week had £87k spend also with zero conversions
- Campaign historically had conversions (3.87 conversions last week for Beeley at similar budget)

**Action:**
1. **Immediate (Today):** Check conversion tracking is functioning correctly for Pilsley Inn
2. Review search terms report - verify traffic quality and intent
3. Verify campaign settings (location targeting, keywords, match types match Beeley Inn which IS converting)
4. Check landing page - ensure booking system working for Pilsley property
5. If no conversion tracking issue found, consider pausing campaign until Q1 2026

**Timeline:** URGENT - Complete investigation by end of Monday 16th December

**Expected Outcome:** Either identify and fix conversion tracking issue, or reallocate £677/month budget to better performers

---

### 2. **[P1 HIGH] Investigate Chatsworth Inns Conversion Drop**

**Issue:** Chatsworth Inns had 2 conversions (£580 value) last week, dropped to zero this week despite similar spend

**Impact:**
- Campaign spend £125.66/week but no return this week
- Represents sudden performance drop (not gradual decline)
- May indicate seasonal issue, tracking problem, or availability issue

**Action:**
1. Review search terms for week 8-14 Dec vs week 1-7 Dec - identify traffic quality changes
2. Check website/booking system - ensure Chatsworth Inns properties available for booking
3. Review landing page analytics - check bounce rate, time on page
4. Compare impression share and ad position week-over-week

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK - Complete by Friday 20th December

**Expected Outcome:** Identify cause of conversion drop and implement fix, or reduce budget if seasonal decline expected

---

### 3. **[P2] Scale Cavendish Budget - Exceptional Performance**

**Issue:** Cavendish delivered 783% ROAS this week (£2,163 value from £276 spend) but has room for growth

**Opportunity:**
- ROAS 783% significantly above 570% target
- Conversion value increased 455% week-over-week
- Impression share 33.6% - room to increase visibility
- Strong week-over-week momentum

**Action:**
1. Analyse Cavendish campaign capacity - check search impression share lost to budget
2. Consider modest budget increase (+£10-15/day) to test scalability
3. Monitor closely for ROAS degradation (target: maintain >600% ROAS)
4. Review with Helen if budget available for reallocation from underperformers

**Timeline:** NEXT WEEK - Propose budget changes for January 2026

**Expected Outcome:** If scalable, could add £500-1,000/month conversion value

---

### 4. **[P2] The Hide Conversion Tracking Verification**

**Issue:** The Hide is second-highest spender (£466/week, 19% of budget) with zero conversions for two weeks

**Context:**
- Recent property (launched October 2025)
- Has separate £2,000/month budget
- Previous CONTEXT.md notes indicated conversion tracking fixed in early November
- Zero conversions may indicate tracking issue rather than poor performance

**Action:**
1. Verify conversion tracking is live and firing correctly for The Hide property
2. Check Google Analytics - are users reaching booking confirmation page?
3. Review booking system integration for The Hide specifically
4. Compare traffic quality (CTR, time on site) vs converting campaigns

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK - Verify by Friday 20th December

**Expected Outcome:** Either fix conversion tracking or confirm property genuinely not converting (may need budget reduction)

---

### 5. **[P3] Review Self-Catering Campaign Performance**

**Issue:** Both self-catering campaigns (Chatsworth SC, Bolton Abbey SC) delivering zero conversions

**Data:**
- Chatsworth SC: £37 spend, 0 conversions
- Bolton Abbey SC: £51.74 spend, 0 conversions
- Combined: £88.74/week = £355/month with no return

**Context:**
- Self-catering may have seasonal booking patterns (people book in advance for holidays)
- December may be off-season for cottage bookings
- Previous CONTEXT.md notes mentioned landing page experiments for Chatsworth SC

**Action:**
1. Review historical data - are self-catering conversions seasonal?
2. Check November performance - was there conversion activity?
3. If seasonal, consider pausing Dec-Jan and resuming in February (when people book Easter/summer)
4. If not seasonal, review landing pages and targeting

**Timeline:** NEXT WEEK - Analysis by 23rd December, decision for January budgets

**Expected Outcome:** Either pause seasonal campaigns or fix conversion issues
