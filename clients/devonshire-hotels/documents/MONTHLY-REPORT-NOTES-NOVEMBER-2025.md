**Commentary:**
The Beeley Inn campaign has been the standout performer in November, delivering nearly 12x return on ad spend. This is significantly above the account target of 570% ROAS. The campaign has been consistently budget-constrained, spending 114% of its allocated daily budget, indicating strong demand and efficient targeting.

**Action Taken (Nov 24):**
Budget increased from £22/day to £45/day (+105%) to capitalise on this exceptional performance. This should allow the campaign to capture additional high-value bookings while the account tracks under overall budget.
