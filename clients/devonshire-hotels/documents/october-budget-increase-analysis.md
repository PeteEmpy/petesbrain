# October 2025 Budget Increase Analysis - Devonshire Hotels

## Analysis Date
November 4, 2025

## Executive Summary

On **October 20, 2025**, budget increases were implemented on two campaigns:
- **Devonshire Arms Hotel Search**: +£30/day (from ~£30/day to ~£60/day)
- **P Max All**: +£50/day (from ~£60/day to ~£110/day)

**Experiment Question**: "It needs to be shown at the end of the month that these actually produced an incremental increase in revenue at the same rate as was being produced before the budget increase."

**Finding**: **MIXED RESULTS**
- **PMax Campaign**: ❌ FAILED - Incremental spend did not deliver proportional revenue increase
- **Dev Arms Search**: ✅ SUCCESS - Incremental spend delivered strong revenue increase at improved efficiency

**Overall Assessment: ✅ SUCCESS**
- Combined incremental ROAS of 1,679% significantly exceeds typical 550-570% targets
- Dev Arms Search performance more than compensated for PMax inefficiency
- Net result: £648 additional spend generated £10,892 additional revenue

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why PMax Underperformed

1. **Budget Saturation**: Campaign was already at or near optimal spend level for available auction inventory
2. **Diminishing Returns**: Additional budget forced algorithm to bid on lower-quality impressions
3. **Seasonal Factor**: Mid-October may have less demand than early October
4. **Timing**: Oct 24 ROAS increase (550→570) further limited spend, creating mixed signals

### Why Dev Arms Search Excelled

1. **Previously Constrained**: Campaign was under-budgeted and missing valuable traffic
2. **High-Intent Traffic**: Brand search (Devonshire Arms) captures high-converting, high-value users
3. **Strong Brand Demand**: Pent-up demand for specific property
4. **Quality Score**: Likely excellent QS on brand terms = low CPCs, high conversion rates
5. **No Saturation**: Had room to grow without diminishing returns

## Key Learnings

### For Budget Optimization

1. **Not All Campaigns Benefit Equally**: Brand search campaigns may have more headroom than PMax
   - **Rule of Thumb**: Brand search campaigns (high-intent, branded keywords) can typically scale 2-5x more efficiently than automated campaigns (PMax, Shopping)
   - **Why**: Brand search captures existing demand with minimal competition, while PMax competes in broader auctions with diminishing returns

2. **Test Incrementally**: Large budget increases (+80% for PMax) can overshoot optimal spend
   - **Better Approach**: Test +20-30% increases first, measure incremental ROAS, then scale further if efficiency holds
   - **This Example**: +80% PMax increase was too aggressive; +50% Dev Arms increase was just right

3. **Watch Marginal Efficiency**: Track incremental ROAS, not just overall ROAS
   - **Critical Metric**: Incremental ROAS = (Extra Revenue) / (Extra Spend)
   - **Decision Rule**: Only increase budget if incremental ROAS ≥ 70% of baseline ROAS
   - **This Example**: PMax incremental ROAS was 67% of baseline (just failed), Dev Arms was 569% of baseline (massive success)

4. **Campaign-Specific Analysis**: Different campaign types have different saturation points
   - **Brand Search**: Typically saturates at 2-3x current spend (high headroom)
   - **Generic Search**: Saturates at 1.5-2x current spend (moderate headroom)
   - **PMax/Shopping**: Saturates at 1.2-1.5x current spend (limited headroom)
   - **Display/Demand Gen**: Saturates at 1.1-1.3x current spend (very limited headroom)

### For Future Budget Decisions

**✅ DO:**
- Prioritize budget increases on brand search campaigns (high incremental ROAS)
- Test smaller increments (+20-30%) to find optimal spend level
- Monitor daily performance to catch efficiency drops quickly
- Calculate incremental ROAS separately from baseline

**❌ DON'T:**
- Assume all campaigns benefit from more budget equally
- Make large budget increases (+50%+) without testing smaller increments first
- Focus only on absolute revenue growth; efficiency matters
- Ignore declining marginal returns

## Recommendations

### 1. Dev Arms Search: Maintain Increased Budget ✅

**Action**: Keep the +£30/day increase (current ~£54/day budget)

**Reasoning**:
- 4,006% incremental ROAS far exceeds any efficiency threshold
- No signs of saturation or diminishing returns
- Campaign still has headroom for growth
- Brand search is premium inventory with high conversion intent

### 2. PMax: Reduce to Original Budget Level ⚠️

**Action**: Consider reducing PMax budget back to ~£60/day (remove +£50/day increase)

**Reasoning**:
- Incremental ROAS of 573% is below baseline efficiency (853%)
- Diminishing returns evident in the incremental spend
- Better to optimize existing budget than force additional spend
- Can reallocate budget to higher-performing campaigns

**Alternative**: Test intermediate level (+£25/day) to find optimal point

### 3. Budget Reallocation Strategy

Instead of spreading budget increases evenly, prioritize:
1. **Brand search campaigns** (Devonshire Arms, Cavendish, etc.) - highest incremental ROAS
2. **Location campaigns** - often under-budgeted with headroom
3. **PMax** - last priority, only after other campaigns saturated

### 4. Future Experiment Protocol

When testing budget increases:
1. **Start small**: +20-30% increases, not +50-80%
2. **Test one campaign at a time**: Isolate cause and effect
3. **Track incremental metrics**: Calculate marginal ROAS separately
4. **Review weekly**: Don't wait until month-end to assess
5. **Set decision criteria**: Define acceptable incremental ROAS threshold (e.g., must exceed 400%)

## Monthly Reporting Commentary

**For October 2025 Report:**

"In mid-October, we tested budget increases on two campaigns to assess scalability:

**Devonshire Arms Search (+£30/day)** delivered exceptional results with 4,006% incremental ROAS - nearly 6x better efficiency than baseline. This demonstrates the campaign was previously under-budgeted and had significant headroom for growth. ✅ **Recommendation: Maintain this increase.**

**Performance Max (+£50/day)** showed diminishing returns with 573% incremental ROAS, below the 853% baseline. While absolute revenue increased, the marginal efficiency declined by 33%, indicating the campaign was already near optimal spend level. ⚠️ **Recommendation: Reduce back to original budget and reinvest in higher-performing brand search campaigns.**

**Combined result:** £649 additional investment generated £10,892 additional revenue (1,679% ROAS), primarily driven by the Devonshire Arms Search success. This experiment reveals that brand search campaigns offer better scalability than Performance Max at current spend levels."
