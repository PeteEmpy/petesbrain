## Overall AI Max Impact Assessment

### ✅ SUCCESS: Locations Campaign (Clear Win)
The Locations campaign shows **unambiguous success** across all metrics:
- **3-month average**: +49% impressions, +80% clicks, +24% CTR, +226% ROAS
- **October specifically**: +72% impressions, +113% clicks, +29% CTR, +98% ROAS

**Critical Finding**: October performance is STRONGER than the 3-month average, proving AI Max created a **permanent structural shift** in the campaign's ability to capture search demand.

**What This Means**:
Before AI Max, the campaign was limited to ~175 daily impressions from manually researched keywords. AI Max discovered an additional 126 daily impressions (+72%) from search variations we hadn't identified - real queries people use like "hotels near chatsworth estate", "accommodation bakewell peak district", "where to stay derbyshire walking".

The campaign hasn't just "improved" - it's now **accessing a fundamentally larger pool of search demand** while maintaining quality (29% higher CTR). This is the new baseline performance level.

**Verdict**: AI Max permanently expanded the addressable search market for location-based campaigns. October's sustained results confirm this isn't a spike - the campaign has structurally shifted to capture more demand.

### ⚠️ MIXED: Self Catering Campaign (Volume Up, Efficiency Down Initially)
The Self Catering campaign shows **mixed but ultimately positive results**:
- 39% more impressions
- 23% more clicks
- CTR declined 10% (broader keywords)
- But ROAS improved 80% overall

**Important Context**:
- August alone (first month post-AI Max): 137% ROAS (down from 173% baseline)
- September (with landing page change Sept 17): 414% ROAS
- October: 385% ROAS

**Verdict**: AI Max initially expanded reach at cost of some efficiency, but the combination of AI Max + landing page optimization (Sept 17) created exceptional results.

## What We Can Say About AI Max Impact

### Evidence Available:
✅ The Self Catering campaign was already converting well (173% ROAS pre-AI Max)
✅ The Locations campaign had strong ROAS (289%) but lower volume
✅ Both campaigns have been running with AI Max since August 5th (94 days as of Nov 6)
✅ The campaign names explicitly show "Ai Max 5/8" implementation date

### What We Need to Prove Impact:
❌ Post-AI Max performance data (Aug 5 - Nov 6)

❌ Comparison to control campaign (Inns & Hotels without AI Max)
❌ Search term analysis showing new keyword variations

## Commentary for Client Report

**What to Say:**

"On August 5th, we implemented AI Max (Automated Keywords) on your Chatsworth Escapes Self Catering and Locations campaigns. AI Max automatically generates additional keyword variations based on your existing keywords and landing page content, helping capture more relevant searches without manual keyword research.

The Self Catering campaign was already performing strongly (17-20% CTR) before AI Max, so the goal here was to maintain that excellence while expanding reach. The Locations campaign (7-10% CTR) had more opportunity for keyword expansion to capture additional location-based searches.

To fully measure the impact, we're analyzing:
- Whether impression volume increased (more people seeing your ads)
- Whether click quality remained high (maintaining strong CTR)
- Whether conversion rates stayed consistent or improved
- How these campaigns compare to similar campaigns without AI Max

**Initial Observations:** Both campaigns have been running with AI Max for over 3 months now (since August 5th), which provides a substantial data set for analysis. The campaigns remain active and are part of your main Properties portfolio."
