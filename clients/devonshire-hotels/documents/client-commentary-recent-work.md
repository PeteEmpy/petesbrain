## 1. AI Max (Automated Keywords) Implementation - August 5th

**What We Did:**

On August 5th, we implemented AI Max (Automated Keywords) on your Chatsworth Escapes Self Catering and Locations campaigns. This feature automatically generates additional keyword variations based on your existing keywords and landing page content, helping capture more relevant searches without constant manual keyword research.

**Why This Matters:**

These campaigns were already performing well (Self Catering had a 17-20% CTR, Locations had 7-10% CTR), but AI Max helps us scale what's working by:
- Automatically testing new keyword variations
- Capturing long-tail searches we might have missed
- Adapting to changing search patterns in real-time
- Reducing manual keyword maintenance time

**Current Status:**

Both campaigns have been running with AI Max for over 3 months now (since August 5th), giving us a substantial data set. The campaigns remain active and continue to be part of your main Properties portfolio.

**Follow-up:** On November 3rd, we rolled out AI Max to all remaining Search campaigns to expand this benefit across your entire account.

## 2. AI Max Rollout to All Search Campaigns - November 3rd

**What We Did:**

We enabled AI Max on all your Search campaigns across the Devonshire account, including:
- Devonshire Arms Hotel
- Cavendish
- The Beeley Inn
- Chatsworth Inns
- The Pilsley Inn
- The Fell
- Bolton Abbey Locations

**Early Observations (3 days of data):**

It's too early to draw conclusions, but we're monitoring:
- Impression growth (we expect 10-30% increases as new keywords activate)
- CTR stability (ensuring quality remains high)
- Search term quality (reviewing what new searches are triggering ads)

**What To Expect:**

AI Max typically takes 2-3 weeks to fully "learn" and stabilize. We'll provide a full analysis in the December report showing:
- Which campaigns benefited most
- New high-performing search terms discovered
- Impact on overall efficiency

## 3. Budget Optimization - October 20th

**What We Did:**

Made targeted budget increases to high-performing campaigns:
- **Devonshire Arms Hotel Search**: +£30/day (now £78/day)
- **P Max All Properties**: +£50/day (now £125/day)

**Why We Did This:**

Both campaigns were consistently hitting their daily budgets and turning away profitable clicks. The budget increases allow us to capture more demand during peak periods while maintaining your target ROAS.

**Results to Track:**

We're measuring whether these increases produced incremental bookings at the same efficiency rate. November's data will show if the additional spend delivered proportional revenue growth.

## 4. ROAS Target Adjustment - October 24th

**What We Did:**

Increased the portfolio bid strategy target ROAS from 550% to 570% across all main campaigns.

**Why We Did This:**

Your campaigns were trending above target, which meant we could:
- Slow down the spend trajectory to hit the monthly budget precisely
- Maintain profitability while pacing spend correctly
- Avoid overspending in the last week of the month

**Result:**

Successfully paced to budget for October while maintaining strong performance.

---

## 5. November Budget Adjustments - November 3rd

**What We Did:**

Adjusted all campaign budgets to align with November's £9,000 target (down from October's £11,730).

**Challenge:**

The month rolled over on a Friday evening, so campaigns ran at the higher October budgets for 3 days (Nov 1-3), spending £1,427 (163% of target pacing).

**Solution:**

Reduced daily budgets across all campaigns on Monday, November 3rd to pace correctly for the remaining 28 days of the month. Daily spend should now stabilize around £272/day to hit exactly £9,000 by month end.

## 6. Chatsworth Escapes Landing Page Optimization - MAJOR WIN

**September 17th: Landing Page Change**

Changed the Chatsworth Escapes Self Catering campaign landing page to jump directly to the cottage map (`#cottagemap` anchor link), skipping the introductory content.

**Why We Did This:**

The self-catering campaigns were underperforming, and we hypothesized that users clicking ads wanted to see cottages immediately, not read introductory content first.

**Results (Sep 17 - Oct 17 vs Previous Month):**

This was a **significant success**:
- ✅ **Conversion rate improved +291%** (0.11% → 0.43%)
- ✅ **Conversions increased +229%** (3.5 → 11.5 bookings)
- ✅ CTR remained strong at 15.25%
- ✅ Cost per click decreased slightly to £0.37

**What This Means:**

By reducing friction and taking users directly to what they were searching for (cottages), we nearly tripled the conversion efficiency. This is exactly the kind of optimization that improves ROI without increasing spend.

**November 4th: A/B Test Setup**

We've now set up an A/B test comparing the current `#cottagemap` landing page against a newly created dedicated PPC landing page (`/cottages-landing-page/`). This test will run through early December to see if we can improve conversion rates even further.

**Test Structure:**
- 50/50 split between the two landing pages
- Primary metric: Conversion rate (0.43% baseline)
- 4-week test period (ending Dec 2nd)
- Will determine which page becomes the permanent landing page

## 7. Google P Max Platform Issues - Ongoing

**Issue:**

Two asset groups (The Beeley Inn and The Pilsley Inn) in the P Max campaign have been showing warnings that we haven't been able to resolve through normal channels.

**Action Taken:**

We've escalated this to Google support and are tracking their response. This is a known platform issue affecting multiple advertisers and not related to our campaign setup.

**Impact:**

These asset groups are still serving and generating bookings, but may not be reaching their full potential until Google resolves the underlying platform bug.

---

## Summary - What This Shows

Over the past 3 months, we've been actively:

1. **Landing page optimization** - Achieved +291% conversion rate improvement on Self Catering campaign
2. **Testing new features** (AI Max) to expand reach efficiently across your campaigns
3. **Optimizing budgets** to match your spending targets and seasonal demand
4. **Fine-tuning ROAS targets** to maintain profitability while pacing correctly
5. **Running A/B tests** to continuously improve conversion efficiency
6. **Troubleshooting platform issues** to ensure campaigns run smoothly

**Result:** Your campaigns continue to deliver strong ROAS while we systematically test improvements and adapt to changing search patterns. The landing page optimization alone has nearly tripled conversion efficiency for self-catering bookings.
