**Days Remaining:** 12
**Required Daily Spend:** **£254.68/day**

## Corrected Analysis vs My Earlier Estimate

**My Earlier Calculation:**
- Spend: £5,788.55
- Projected overspend: £616.56
- Reduction needed: £51/day

**ACTUAL (from Google Ads):**
- Spend: £5,943.90
- Projected overspend: **£906.49**
- Reduction needed: **£64.32/day**

**Difference:** I was **underestimating spend by £155.35** and **reduction needed by £13.32/day**

The discrepancy was likely from:
1. Bolton Abbey SC paused mid-period (£154.73 spent before pause)
2. Possible data lag in my earlier query
3. Today's (Nov 18) partial spend included in THIS_MONTH query

---

## Recommendation

Need to reduce budgets by **£64/day** (not £51/day as initially calculated).

This is **MORE AGGRESSIVE** than initial plan.
