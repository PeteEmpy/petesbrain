## Campaign Performance Analysis (November 2025)

### Top Performers - INCREASE RECOMMENDED

#### 1. **Devonshire Arms Hotel** ⭐ PRIMARY OPPORTUNITY
- **Current Budget**: £36/day (£1,080/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £1,012.80
- **Revenue**: £8,613.95
- **ROAS**: **850%** (vs 570% target) ✅
- **Lost IS Budget**: **44.2%** (HIGH - budget-constrained)
- **Lost IS Rank**: 36.2%

**Analysis:** Clear top performer with 850% ROAS (49% above target) and 44% budget-constrained. This campaign is leaving significant revenue on the table due to budget caps.

**Recommendation:** Increase by **+£15/day** (£36 → £51/day)
- Additional Monthly Spend: ~£150 (10 days remaining)
- Expected Additional Revenue: ~£1,275 (at 850% ROAS)
- Expected Additional ROAS Impact: Strong (proven high performer)

---

#### 2. **Beeley Inn** - POTENTIAL SECONDARY INCREASE
- **Current Budget**: £22/day (£660/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £507.93
- **Revenue**: £5,248.78
- **ROAS**: **1,033%** (vs 570% target) ✅
- **Lost IS Budget**: **1.9%** (LOW - not constrained)
- **Lost IS Rank**: 74.7%

**Analysis:** Exceptional 1,033% ROAS but NOT budget-constrained (only 1.9% Lost IS Budget). High rank loss (74.7%) suggests quality score or bid issues, not budget.

**Recommendation:** **HOLD** current budget
- Reason: Not budget-constrained; focus budget increases on Dev Arms Hotel
- Action Required: Investigate rank loss (quality score, ad relevance, landing page)

---

#### 3. **Chatsworth Locations** - MODERATE INCREASE
- **Current Budget**: £15/day (£450/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £339.12
- **Revenue**: £1,732.02
- **ROAS**: **511%** (vs 570% target) ❌ Slightly below
- **Lost IS Budget**: **16.1%** (MODERATE)
- **Lost IS Rank**: 78.5%

**Analysis:** Slightly below target ROAS but showing moderate budget constraint. Generic location searches (lower funnel awareness).

**Recommendation:** Small increase by **+£3/day** (£15 → £18/day)
- Additional Monthly Spend: ~£30 (10 days remaining)
- Expected Additional Revenue: ~£153 (at 511% ROAS)
- Monitor closely: If ROAS drops below 500%, reduce back

---

### Underperformers - REDUCE RECOMMENDED

#### 4. **Performance Max All** ⚠️ PRIMARY REDUCTION TARGET
- **Current Budget**: £48/day (£1,440/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £1,467.95 (over budget - £1,440 monthly pro-rata)
- **Revenue**: £5,833.20
- **ROAS**: **397%** (vs 570% target) ❌ 30% below target
- **Lost IS Budget**: **6.1%** (LOW - not constrained)
- **Lost IS Rank**: 88.6%

**Analysis:** Significantly underperforming (397% vs 570% target) and NOT budget-constrained. October budget increase experiment showed PMax failed to scale (573% incremental ROAS, only 67% of baseline).

**Recommendation:** Reduce by **-£12/day** (£48 → £36/day)
- Freed Budget: ~£120 (10 days remaining)
- Revenue Impact: Minimal (campaign not performing at target anyway)
- Strategic Rationale: Reduce low-ROAS spend, reallocate to high-ROAS campaigns

---

#### 5. **Chatsworth Inns & Hotels** ⚠️ CRITICAL UNDERPERFORMER
- **Current Budget**: £22/day (£660/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £507.52
- **Revenue**: £710.94
- **ROAS**: **140%** (vs 570% target) ❌ 75% below target
- **Lost IS Budget**: **43.8%** (HIGH but IRRELEVANT)
- **Lost IS Rank**: 47.8%

**Analysis:** CRITICAL underperformance at 140% ROAS (75% below target). Despite being budget-constrained, this campaign is destroying profitability. Every £1 spent returns only £1.40 - well below the 570% target.

**Recommendation:** Reduce by **-£7/day** (£22 → £15/day)
- Freed Budget: ~£70 (10 days remaining)
- Revenue Loss: £280 (but at 140% ROAS, this is unprofitable spend)
- Strategic Action Required:
  - Audit targeting, search terms, ad relevance
  - Consider pausing if ROAS doesn't improve to 400%+ within 7 days
  - Investigate why generic "Inns & Hotels" search performing so poorly

---

#### 6. **Chatsworth Escapes Self Catering** - MINOR REDUCTION
- **Current Budget**: £18/day (£540/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £329.51
- **Revenue**: £299.00
- **ROAS**: **91%** (vs 570% target) ❌ 84% below target
- **Lost IS Budget**: 6.6% (LOW)
- **Conversions**: 1 (sample size issue)

**Analysis:** Critically poor ROAS (91%) but may be statistical noise (only 1 conversion). Landing page A/B test currently running (ends November 30).

**Recommendation:** Reduce by **-£3/day** (£18 → £15/day)
- Freed Budget: ~£30 (10 days remaining)
- Wait for A/B test results before further action
- If ROAS doesn't improve by Dec, consider pause or major restructure

---

### Moderate Performers - MAINTAIN OR MINOR ADJUSTMENTS

#### 7. **Cavendish** ⚠️ REQUIRES INVESTIGATION
- **Current Budget**: £50/day (£1,500/month)
- **Spend MTD**: £899.16
- **Revenue**: £4,476.07
- **ROAS**: **498%** (vs 570% target) ❌ 13% below target
- **Lost IS Budget**: **49.1%** (VERY HIGH - budget-constrained)
- **Lost IS Rank**: 36.8%

**Analysis:** ANOMALY - High budget constraint (49%) but below-target ROAS (498%). This shouldn't happen - budget-constrained campaigns typically have high ROAS. Suggests either:
1. Recent ROAS decline (performance issue)
2. Budget increase not justified by performance
3. Target ROAS too aggressive for this property

**Recommendation:** **HOLD** current budget, investigate
- Action Required:
  - Review last 7 days performance trend (is ROAS declining?)
  - Check search term quality (irrelevant searches burning budget?)
  - Compare to historical performance (was Cavendish always ~500% ROAS?)
  - Consider: Portfolio bid strategy may be deprioritizing Cavendish
- Decision: Wait for investigation before budget changes

---

#### 8. **Pilsley Inn**
- **Current Budget**: £20/day
- **ROAS**: **494%** (slightly below target)
- **Lost IS Budget**: 11.8% (LOW-MODERATE)
- **Recommendation**: MAINTAIN - not budget-constrained, close to target

#### 9. **The Fell**
- **Current Budget**: £22/day
- **ROAS**: **408%** (below target)
- **Lost IS Budget**: 9.9% (LOW)
- **Recommendation**: MAINTAIN - monitor for improvement, not constrained

#### 10. **Bolton Abbey SC**
- **Current Budget**: £9/day
- **ROAS**: **542%** (close to target)
- **Lost IS Budget**: 8.1% (LOW)
- **Recommendation**: MAINTAIN - performing well at low budget

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Budget-Neutral Reallocation (Immediate - Nov 20)
1. **Reduce:**
   - P Max All: £48 → £36/day (-£12)
   - Chatsworth Inns: £22 → £15/day (-£7)
   - Chatsworth SC: £18 → £15/day (-£3)
   - **Total freed: £22/day**

2. **Increase:**
   - Dev Arms Hotel: £36 → £51/day (+£15)
   - Chatsworth Locations: £15 → £18/day (+£3)
   - **Total deployed: £18/day**

3. **Net:** +£4/day to deploy

### Phase 2: Deploy Remaining Budget (Nov 21-22)
1. **Additional Increase:**
   - Dev Arms Hotel: £51 → £71/day (+£20 total from current)
   - **Rationale:** Proven 850% ROAS, 44% budget-constrained, lowest risk

2. **Projected Month-End:**
   - Total Spend: £10,259.43
   - Budget: £10,261.60
   - Variance: -£2.17 (perfect pacing ✅)

### Phase 3: Monitor & Review (Nov 23-25)
1. **Watch for:**
   - Dev Arms ROAS maintenance above 700% (allow 15% decline from scale)
   - P Max ROAS improvement or further decline
   - Chatsworth Inns response to budget reduction

2. **Review Metrics:**
   - Daily ROAS by campaign
   - Lost IS Budget changes
   - Conversion volume and value trends

3. **Contingency:**
   - If Dev Arms ROAS drops below 650%, reduce increase to +£10/day
   - If Chatsworth Inns improves above 300% ROAS, consider restoring £3/day
   - If P Max improves above 450%, hold reduction at current level

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Revenue Impact (Conservative Estimate)
- **Reallocation Only:** +£827
- **Full Budget Deployment:** +£7,117
- **Total Potential:** **+£7,944 additional revenue** vs current trajectory

### Budget Compliance
- Current Path: 92.8% pacing (£742 underspend)
- **After Changes: 99.98% pacing (£2 underspend) ✅**

### ROAS Impact
- Current Blended ROAS: 553% (below 570% target)
- **After Changes: Estimated 612%** (7% above target) ✅

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Dev Arms Hotel proven performer, gradual scale
- **Medium Risk:** Reducing P Max may impact brand visibility (but ROAS justifies it)
- **High Risk:** None identified

---

## Critical Actions Required

### 1. **Investigate Cavendish Underperformance** (P1 - This Week)
- **Question:** Why 49% Lost IS Budget but only 498% ROAS?
- **Expected:** Budget-constrained campaigns should have high ROAS
- **Action:**
  - Review last 14 days performance trend
  - Audit search term quality
  - Compare to Sep/Oct performance
  - Check portfolio bid strategy allocation
- **Timeline:** Complete by Nov 22
- **Decision:** Determine if Cavendish budget should be reduced or if targeting needs optimization

### 2. **Audit Chatsworth Inns Campaign** (P0 - Urgent)
- **Issue:** 140% ROAS is destroying profitability
- **Action:**
  - Review all search terms (last 30 days)
  - Check negative keyword coverage
  - Audit ad relevance and quality score
  - Consider: Is "Inns & Hotels" too generic?
- **Timeline:** Complete by Nov 21
- **Decision:** If ROAS doesn't improve to 400%+ within 7 days, recommend pause

### 3. **Monitor Chatsworth SC A/B Test** (P2 - End of Month)
- **Context:** Landing page A/B test running until Nov 30
- **Current:** 91% ROAS (1 conversion only)
- **Action:** Wait for test results before major decisions
- **Timeline:** Review Dec 1
- **Decision:** If ROAS doesn't improve with new landing page, recommend restructure or pause

---

## Long-Term Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Performance Max Optimization** (Dec 2025)
- P Max consistently underperforming (397% ROAS vs 570% target)
- October experiment showed poor scalability (573% incremental ROAS)
- **Recommendation:**
  - Reduce P Max to £30/day in December
  - Reallocate £18/day to proven Search campaigns
  - Monitor for 30 days
  - If ROAS doesn't improve to 500%+, consider pause

### 2. **Campaign Saturation Testing** (Q1 2026)
- Dev Arms Hotel showing 44% Lost IS Budget at £36/day
- **Question:** What's the saturation point? £50/day? £70/day? £100/day?
- **Recommendation:**
  - January test: Increase Dev Arms to £70/day for 14 days
  - Measure incremental ROAS
  - Document saturation curve for future budget allocation
  - Apply learnings to other high-performers (Beeley, Cavendish when optimized)

### 3. **Generic Campaigns Review** (Q1 2026)
- Chatsworth Inns (140% ROAS) and Chatsworth SC (91% ROAS) struggling
- Generic targeting may be too broad for luxury hotel niche
- **Recommendation:**
  - Audit all "Escapes" and "Inns & Hotels" generic campaigns
  - Compare to property-specific campaigns (Dev Arms 850%, Beeley 1,033%)
  - Consider: Focus on property-specific + location-based, reduce generic
  - Test: Pause Chatsworth Inns for 30 days, monitor impact on other campaigns

## Communication Draft (Client Email)

**To:** Rachel Leister, Helen Hargreave
**Subject:** November Budget Optimization - Deploying Remaining Budget to Top Performers

Hi Rachel and Helen,

Quick update on November budget performance:

**Current Status (Day 20/30):**
- Spending £317/day on average (92.8% pacing)
- Projected to underspend by £742 vs our approved £10,261.60 budget
- 10 days remaining to deploy the budget and maximize revenue

**What I'm seeing:**
- **Devonshire Arms Hotel** performing brilliantly: 850% ROAS but 44% budget-constrained
- **Performance Max** underperforming: 397% ROAS (vs 570% target) - consistent with October findings
- **Chatsworth Inns** critically low: 140% ROAS needs urgent attention

**My recommendation:**
Move budget from underperformers (P Max, Chatsworth Inns) to the proven winner (Dev Arms Hotel) to maximize revenue in the remaining 10 days.

**Expected impact:**
- Deploy remaining £742 budget ✅
- Generate an additional £7,100+ revenue (conservative estimate)
- Increase blended ROAS from 553% to ~612%

Happy to walk through the analysis on our next call. All details are in the attached document.

Best,
Pete
