## 🎯 Rationale for Each Change

### Main Properties

**Big Decreases (Oct 30-31 end-of-month push reversal):**
- **P Max All**: £200 → £75 (-£125) - Reducing from temporary boost, still gets largest share
- **Devonshire Arms**: £200 → £48 (-£152) - Best ROAS (10.60) but reducing from temporary boost
- **Cavendish**: £150 → £45 (-£105) - Strong ROAS (6.89), reducing from temporary boost

**Moderate Decreases:**
- **The Beeley Inn**: £50 → £33 (-£17) - Maintaining good coverage, slight reduction
- **The Pilsley Inn**: £40 → £27 (-£13) - Lower ROAS (4.06), modest reduction
- **The Fell**: £35 → £24 (-£11) - Lower ROAS (4.05), modest reduction
- **Chatsworth Inns**: £30 → £28 (-£2) - Small reduction
- **Chatsworth Locations**: £25 → £18 (-£7) - Moderate reduction

**Small Increase:**
- **Bolton Abbey Locations**: £10 → £12 (+£2) - Underperforming but deserves more coverage

### Self-Catering

**Both Decreased:**
- **Bolton Abbey Self Catering**: £16 → £10 (-£6) - Low priority for November
- **Chatsworth Self Catering**: £30 → £20 (-£10) - Reduce to fit within £900 allocation

### The Hide

- Maintain £67/day to hit £2,000 monthly budget (separate tracking)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **These budgets assume:**
   - 30 days in November
   - Similar ROAS performance to October
   - No major seasonal fluctuations

2. **Monitor closely:**
   - First week of November - check if campaigns are hitting budgets
   - If high ROAS campaigns (Devonshire Arms, Cavendish) are limited by budget, consider shifting from lower performers

3. **The Hide:**
   - First full month of operation
   - May under-pace initially (still ramping up)
   - Budget can be reallocated mid-month if needed

4. **Self-Catering:**
   - Reduced significantly from October
   - Monitor if this impacts overall property bookings
   - Can be increased if main properties underspend

5. **October 30-31:**
   - Current inflated budgets (£200/£200/£150 on top 3) are for end-of-month push only
   - These revert on Nov 1st to the new recommended levels

---

## 📅 Mid-Month Review Checklist (Nov 15)

- [ ] Check if £5,500 spent (half of £11,000 budget)
- [ ] Verify ROAS is maintaining ~5.5 or higher
- [ ] Identify any campaigns limited by budget
- [ ] Identify any campaigns underspending
- [ ] Adjust budgets if needed to pace correctly
