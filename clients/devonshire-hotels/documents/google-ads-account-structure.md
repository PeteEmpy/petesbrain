# The Devonshire Google Ads Account Structure

The Devonshire Google Ads account is used to promote and drive bookings for properties owned by The Devonshire Group. These include a mix of luxury hotels, self-catering cottages, exclusive-use venues, and wedding locations. Each type of property is managed under a distinct set of Google Ads campaigns, which can be identified by consistent naming conventions in the campaign titles.

## 1. Main Hotel Properties

Campaigns promoting Devonshire's hotels are identified by the naming convention **"DEV | Properties"** in the campaign name.

**Objective:**
To generate direct bookings for Devonshire's six main hotels, all of which are marketed individually through paid search and display activity.

**Properties included:**
- The Devonshire Arms (often referred to internally as DABA)
- The Cavendish
- The Beeley Inn
- The Pilsley Inn
- The Fell
- The Hide – newly opened on 10th October 2025, formerly known as The Highwayman

In addition to hotel name type campaigns, there are also location-based campaigns as well. All hotel bookings are processed through an external booking engine, not directly on the main Devonshire website.

## 2. Self-Catering Properties
(Cottages, Shepherd's Huts, and Estate Retreats)

Campaigns focused on Devonshire's self-catering portfolio can be identified by having **"self catering"** in their campaign name.

**Objective:**
To promote stays at Devonshire's range of self-catering accommodation across the Chatsworth and Bolton Abbey estates.

**These include:**
- Traditional holiday cottages
- Charming shepherd's huts
- Unique heritage properties, such as the Russian Cottage on the Chatsworth Estate

Bookings for these properties are also managed via an external booking engine.

## 3. Exclusive-Use Venues
(Lismore Castle & The Hall)

Campaigns for Devonshire's exclusive-use venues focus on generating high-value enquiries rather than instant bookings.

**Lismore Castle**
Located in Ireland, Lismore Castle is available for exclusive hire and primarily targets the U.S. market. Campaigns include "Lismore" in the campaign name.

**The Hall**
Situated on the Bolton Abbey Estate, The Hall is a grand mansion house also available for private hire. Campaigns typically include "Hall" in the campaign name.

These two campaigns are often reported together, as both operate on a lead generation model rather than direct booking.

## 4. Weddings

The Weddings campaign is identified by the presence of the word **"weddings"** in the campaign name.

**Objective:**
To drive wedding enquiries for Devonshire venues. The dedicated landing page highlights wedding experiences at The Fell and The Devonshire Arms, showcasing venue imagery, packages, and enquiry forms.

This campaign is lead generation focused, directing users to make contact or request further information rather than complete an online booking.
