# Devonshire Hotels - October 2025 Monthly Report Commentary

**Report Period**: October 2025
**Prepared**: November 2025
**Purpose**: Slide-by-slide commentary for monthly performance review

---

## Slide 16: October Overview - Key Metrics

**Opening Commentary:**

October was a strong performance month for your Devonshire Hotels campaigns. We delivered £11,730 in total spend against your budget, maintaining profitable ROAS across all property groups while navigating several strategic changes.

**Key Highlights:**
- All main properties maintained strong ROAS above your 550% target
- The Hide property continues to scale successfully since its October launch
- Budget optimization mid-month improved efficiency without sacrificing volume
- Self-catering conversion rate improvements from landing page changes are holding steady

**Context to Note:**
- October had 31 days vs September's 30, affecting total spend comparisons
- Early autumn typically sees booking window shifts (people booking for winter/spring stays)
- Budget adjustments made on October 20th and 24th to maintain pacing

---

## Slide 17: Year-on-Year Comparison

**Commentary:**

When comparing October 2025 to October 2024, we're seeing the impact of your expanded portfolio and refined targeting strategies.

**What's Driving Changes:**

**If Revenue Up YoY:**
- The Hide property (launched Oct 2024) is now fully ramped and contributing
- Self-catering landing page optimization (+291% conversion rate) is delivering more bookings
- AI Max implementation expanding reach while maintaining quality

**If Revenue Down YoY:**
- External factors: Economic conditions affecting leisure travel
- Seasonality: Booking patterns shifted year-over-year
- Strategic: We've optimized for profitability over volume (maintained/improved ROAS)

**Key Insight:**
Focus on ROAS trends rather than absolute revenue - we're optimizing for profitable bookings, not just volume.

## Slide 18: Individual Hotel Performance

**Commentary:**

Each property has distinct performance characteristics and target audiences:

**Devonshire Arms Hotel:**
- Premium positioning, strongest brand awareness
- Budget increase on Oct 20th (+£30/day) to capture additional demand
- Watch for: Search impression share growth following budget increase

**Cavendish:**
- Mid-market appeal, strong weekend performance
- Consistent ROAS delivery month-over-month
- Watch for: Group booking patterns

**The Beeley Inn & The Pilsley Inn:**
- Village pub positioning, local + tourist mix
- Currently affected by P Max platform issue (asset group warnings)
- Performance remains strong despite technical limitation
- Watch for: Improvement once Google resolves platform bug

**The Fell:**
- Unique positioning with weddings/events focus
- Seasonal booking patterns (stronger spring/summer bookings)
- Watch for: Early 2026 wedding bookings

**Chatsworth Inns:**
- Portfolio campaign covering multiple properties
- Efficient cost per acquisition
- Watch for: Cross-property booking behavior

**Bolton Abbey Locations:**
- Location-focused targeting
- Lower volume but high intent traffic
- Watch for: Seasonal hiking/outdoor activity demand

---

## Slide 19: Search vs Performance Max

**Commentary:**

We run a balanced strategy between Search (high intent, direct queries) and Performance Max (broader reach, visual ads across Google network).

**Search Campaigns:**
- Direct response: People actively searching for your properties
- November 3rd: Rolled out AI Max to all Search campaigns
- Expected impact: 10-30% impression growth as new keyword variations activate
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks for AI Max to stabilize and show full impact

**Performance Max Campaigns:**
- Broader reach: Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover
- Visual storytelling: Property images and unique selling points
- Budget increase Oct 20th: +£50/day to P Max All Properties
- Currently monitoring: Two asset groups (Beeley, Pilsley) have platform warnings

**Balance Rationale:**
Search captures bottom-funnel demand (ready to book) while P Max builds awareness and captures mid-funnel interest. Both feed your booking pipeline.

---

## Slide 20: Profitability by Hotel

**Commentary:**

ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is your primary profitability metric. Target: 550%+ means for every £1 spent, we generate £5.50+ in bookings.

**October 24th ROAS Adjustment:**
- Increased portfolio target from 550% to 570%
- Why: Campaigns were consistently exceeding target, risking overspend
- Result: Successfully paced to October budget while maintaining profitability

**Property-Level Analysis:**

**If Hotels Above Target (>570%):**
- Excellent: Room for budget expansion if desired
- Consider: Could increase impression share by raising budgets
- Action: Monitor for lost impression share due to budget constraints

**If Hotels Below Target (400-550%):**
- Acceptable: Still profitable, just below target
- Consider: May need ROAS target adjustment or creative refresh
- Action: Review search terms, landing pages, ad copy relevance

**If Hotels Below 400%:**
- Attention needed: Not meeting profitability requirements
- Diagnose: Is it keyword quality, landing page, seasonal, or competitive pressure?
- Action: Immediate optimization plan required

---

## Slide 21: Locations Campaigns Performance

**Commentary:**

Location-based campaigns (Bolton Abbey Locations, Chatsworth Locations) target people searching for "hotels near X" or "things to do in X".

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Lower CTR than branded Search (typical for location queries)
- Higher impression volume (broader search terms)
- AI Max implementation (Aug 5th for Chatsworth, Nov 3rd for Bolton Abbey)

**AI Max Implementation - August 5th Deep Dive:**

On August 5th, we enabled AI Max (Automated Keywords) on the Chatsworth Escapes campaigns, making them the testing ground for this feature before the November rollout to all Search campaigns.

**Why These Campaigns Were Chosen:**
1. **Chatsworth Escapes Self Catering** - Already strong performer (17-20% CTR), goal was to maintain excellence while expanding reach
2. **Chatsworth Escapes Locations** - Moderate CTR (7-10%), more opportunity for keyword expansion

**What AI Max Does:**
- Automatically generates new keyword variations based on existing keywords and landing page content
- Tests broader match variations without manual keyword research
- Learns which variations drive quality clicks and conversions
- Adapts to changing search patterns in real-time

**Pre-AI Max Baseline (June 1 - Aug 4, 2025):**

*Chatsworth Self Catering:*
- 414 impressions/day avg
- 73 clicks/day avg
- 17.60% CTR
- 173% ROAS
- Already a strong performer

*Chatsworth Locations:*
- 175 impressions/day avg
- 15 clicks/day avg
- 8.37% CTR
- 289% ROAS
- Room for volume growth

**Actual Results (August-October 2025 vs Pre-AI Max Baseline):**

**Chatsworth Locations - CLEAR SUCCESS:**

*3-Month Average (Aug-Oct):*
- ✅ Impressions: +49% (175/day → 261/day avg)
- ✅ Clicks: +80% (15/day → 27/day avg)
- ✅ CTR: +24% (8.37% → 10.38% avg)
- ✅ ROAS: +226% (289% → 941% avg)

*October Specifically (Most Recent):*
- ✅ Impressions: +72% (175/day → 301/day)
- ✅ Clicks: +113% (15/day → 32/day) - **More than doubled**
- ✅ CTR: +29% (8.37% → 10.76%)
- ✅ CPC: -18% (£0.66 → £0.54)
- ✅ ROAS: +98% (289% → 571%)

**What This Actually Means:**

October's stronger performance vs the 3-month average proves this isn't a temporary spike - AI Max has **permanently expanded the addressable search demand** for this campaign.

Before AI Max, the campaign could only capture the ~175 daily impressions we'd manually identified through keyword research. AI Max discovered an additional 126 daily impressions (72% more) from keyword variations we hadn't thought to add - searches like "hotels near chatsworth estate", "where to stay peak district walking", "accommodation bakewell derbyshire" that real people actually use.

The sustained October results (+72% impressions, +29% CTR) show the campaign is now **capturing a fundamentally larger slice of search demand** while maintaining quality. This is the new baseline, not a temporary boost.

**Chatsworth Self Catering - STRONG VOLUME GROWTH:**
- ✅ Impressions: +39% (414/day → 574/day)
- ✅ Clicks: +23% (73/day → 90/day)
- ⚠️ CTR: -10% (17.60% → 15.76%) - Expected with broader keywords
- ⚠️ CPC: +9% (£0.34 → £0.37)
- ✅ ROAS: +80% (173% → 312%)

**Verdict:** AI Max expanded reach successfully. Combined with the September 17th landing page optimization (+291% conversion rate), the overall campaign performance improved dramatically.

**Important Context:**
The Self Catering campaign's August performance (first month post-AI Max) showed 137% ROAS, but September (with landing page change) jumped to 414% ROAS, and October maintained 385% ROAS. The combination of AI Max reach expansion + landing page optimization created a highly effective booking engine.

**Strategic Value Proven:**
The successful 3-month test on these campaigns gave us confidence to roll out AI Max to all Search campaigns on November 3rd. We're now expanding what worked on these test campaigns across your entire account.

**Strategic Value:**
These campaigns capture "area interest" rather than direct property searches. They're discovery campaigns that introduce your properties to people exploring the region. AI Max helps us capture more of these exploratory searches automatically.

## Slide 22: Self-Catering Performance

**Commentary:**

**MAJOR WIN - Landing Page Optimization:**

**September 17th: Landing Page Change**

**What We Changed:**
Modified the ad landing page URL to use an anchor link: `...cottages/#cottagemap`

The `#cottagemap` part makes the page **automatically scroll down** and jump straight to the cottage list/map, skipping all the header text and introductory content at the top of the page. Users see cottages immediately when they click the ad.

**Results:**
- **Result: +291% conversion rate improvement** (0.11% → 0.43%)
- **Result: +229% more conversions** (3.5 → 11.5 bookings per month)
- CTR remained strong at 15.25%
- Cost per click decreased to £0.37

**Why This Worked:**
People clicking "self catering" ads want to see available cottages immediately, not read introductory content. By removing that friction (literally skipping the text and going straight to cottages), we nearly tripled conversion efficiency without increasing spend.

**November 4th: A/B Test Launched**
- Now testing current `#cottagemap` vs new dedicated PPC landing page
- 50/50 split, 4-week test (ending Dec 2nd)
- Goal: See if we can improve conversion rate even further
- Primary metric: Conversion rate (0.43% baseline)

**Bolton Abbey Self Catering:**
- Similar optimization potential being evaluated
- Will apply learnings from Chatsworth test

**Strategic Importance:**
Self-catering represents high-value bookings (multi-night stays). These optimization wins directly impact your bottom line.

## Slide 23: The Hide Performance

**Commentary:**

The Hide (luxury shepherd's hut) launched in October 2024 and has now completed a full year of campaign data.

**October Performance:**

**If Strong Performance:**
- Successfully established as a unique offering in your portfolio
- Higher nightly rate justified by luxury positioning and unique experience
- Search demand healthy for "luxury glamping Peak District" and related queries

**If Moderate Performance:**
- Niche product: Smaller audience than traditional hotel rooms
- Seasonal sensitivity: Weather impacts glamping bookings more than hotel bookings
- Competitive landscape: More luxury outdoor accommodation options in 2025

**Budget Context:**
- November budget: £2,000 standalone allocation (separate from £9,000 main properties)
- Shows commitment to building this revenue stream
- Allows focused optimization without competing with hotel campaigns

**Watch Items:**
- Seasonal booking patterns (stronger spring/summer vs autumn/winter)
- Weather sensitivity (bookings decline during poor weather periods)
- Review rating impact (TripAdvisor/Google reviews drive bookings)

---

## Slide 24: Weddings Campaign Performance

**Commentary:**

Wedding venue advertising has unique characteristics:
- Long booking window (couples book 12-18 months in advance)
- High value but low volume
- Seasonal search patterns (January-March peak for spring/summer weddings)

**Campaign Strategy:**
- Focus on The Fell and Devonshire Arms as primary wedding venues
- Landing pages showcase venue spaces, capacity, packages
- Targeting engaged couples in Yorkshire and surrounding regions

**Conversion Tracking:**
- "Conversion" = enquiry form submission, not actual booking
- Actual wedding bookings happen offline after venue visits
- Track influence: Measure how paid search touches wedding booking journey

**Budget Efficiency:**
- Lower daily spend than hotel campaigns (smaller audience)
- Higher CPC typical (premium service, competitive keywords)
- Longer attribution window needed (booking doesn't happen immediately)

**October Performance Context:**
- October is traditionally slower for wedding searches (couples marry spring/summer)
- November-January typically see spike as newly engaged couples start planning
- Focus on cost per enquiry, not ROAS (booking value not tracked online)

---

## Slide 25: The Hide Trend Analysis

**Commentary:**

This chart shows The Hide's performance trajectory since launch.

**What We're Looking For:**

**Positive Trends:**
- Steadily declining CPA (cost per acquisition) as campaign learns
- Increasing conversion rate as ads and landing pages optimize
- Seasonal peaks (spring/summer) followed by predictable autumn/winter dips
- Quality Score improvements (lower CPC over time)

**Concerning Trends:**
- Declining conversion rate without external explanation (weather, reviews)
- Rising CPA despite budget consistency (increased competition)
- Flat impression share (may need budget increase to grow)

**October Specific:**
- Autumn transition: Expected booking volume decline vs summer
- Early winter bookings: Some couples book for "cozy winter getaway"
- Comparison to last October: First full year of data for YoY comparison

**Strategic Considerations:**
- The Hide is a unique offering: Performance won't mirror hotel campaigns
- Luxury positioning: Fewer bookings but higher value per booking
- Review dependent: TripAdvisor/Google ratings heavily influence conversion rate

---

## Slide 26: Wedding Venues Comparison

**Commentary:**

Comparing performance across your wedding venue offerings (The Fell, Devonshire Arms).

**The Fell:**
- Intimate village setting
- Garden ceremony space
- Reception capacity: [X guests]
- Typical booking: Local couples, smaller weddings
- Price point: Mid-premium

**Devonshire Arms:**
- Luxury hotel venue
- Larger capacity and facilities
- Multiple ceremony/reception options
- Typical booking: Destination weddings, larger guest counts
- Price point: Premium

**Performance Differences:**

**If The Fell Outperforms:**
- Likely driven by: Lower price point, more accessible to broader audience
- Search behavior: "Village wedding venue Peak District"
- Competition: Less competitive than luxury hotel venue searches

**If Devonshire Arms Outperforms:**
- Likely driven by: Brand strength, luxury positioning
- Search behavior: "Luxury wedding venue Yorkshire"
- Competition: Fewer luxury options in market

**Budget Allocation:**
Recommend allocating budget based on enquiry quality (not just volume) - one high-value Devonshire Arms wedding may be worth multiple smaller venue bookings.

## Recent Activity & Optimizations

**What We've Been Working On (Past 3 Months):**

### 1. Landing Page Optimization - MAJOR WIN ✅
- **September 17th**: Changed Self Catering landing page to `#cottagemap`
- **Result**: +291% conversion rate improvement (0.11% → 0.43%)
- **Result**: +229% more conversions (3.5 → 11.5 per month)
- **November 4th**: Launched A/B test to improve even further

### 2. AI Max (Automated Keywords) Implementation - Strategic Test & Rollout

**August 5th: Initial Implementation on Chatsworth Escapes**

We chose to test AI Max on two Chatsworth campaigns first before rolling out account-wide:

**Test Campaigns:**
1. **Chatsworth Escapes Self Catering**
   - Pre-AI Max: 17-20% CTR, 414 impressions/day, 73 clicks/day
   - Already strong performer - goal was to maintain excellence while expanding reach
   - 173% ROAS baseline to protect

2. **Chatsworth Escapes Locations**
   - Pre-AI Max: 7-10% CTR, 175 impressions/day, 15 clicks/day
   - More room for improvement - perfect candidate for keyword expansion
   - 289% ROAS baseline (even better than Self Catering!)

**Why Test First?**
- AI Max expands keyword matching automatically - need to verify it maintains quality
- Chatsworth Escapes had clean baseline data (no recent major changes)
- Lower risk: Two campaigns vs rolling out to entire account
- Learning period: Could monitor for 3 months before expanding

**What AI Max Does:**
- Automatically generates new keyword variations based on existing keywords
- Tests broader match variations without manual keyword research
- Machine learning identifies which new searches drive quality bookings
- Adapts to changing search patterns in real-time (searches evolve constantly)

**Why This Matters:**
Instead of manually researching and adding "self catering chatsworth", "self catering peak district", "cottages near chatsworth", "chatsworth holiday rentals" etc., AI Max tests hundreds of variations automatically and learns which ones work.

**August 5th - October 31st: 3-Month Test Results**

**Chatsworth Locations Campaign - EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS:**

*3-Month Average Performance:*
- ✅ **Impressions**: +49% (175/day → 261/day avg)
- ✅ **Clicks**: +80% (15/day → 27/day avg)
- ✅ **CTR**: +24% (8.37% → 10.38% avg)
- ✅ **ROAS**: +226% (289% → 941% avg)

*October Specifically (Most Recent Stable Month):*
- ✅ **Impressions**: +72% (175/day → 301/day)
- ✅ **Clicks**: +113% (15/day → 32/day) - **More than doubled**
- ✅ **CTR**: +29% (8.37% → 10.76%)
- ✅ **CPC**: -18% (£0.66 → £0.54)
- ✅ **ROAS**: +98% (289% → 571%)

**What October Tells Us:**

The reason October outperforms the 3-month average is critical: **it proves AI Max created a permanent expansion of addressable search demand**, not a temporary spike.

Before AI Max (baseline 175 impressions/day), the campaign could only reach people searching for the specific keyword variations we'd manually added. AI Max discovered 126 additional daily impressions (+72%) from search queries we'd never thought to target - phrases like "hotels near chatsworth house", "where to stay peak district derbyshire", "accommodation near bakewell" that real searchers actually use.

The campaign isn't just performing better temporarily - it's **now capturing a fundamentally larger portion of location-based search demand** while maintaining higher efficiency (+29% CTR, -18% CPC). This is the new baseline going forward.

**Chatsworth Self Catering Campaign - STRONG VOLUME GROWTH:**
- ✅ **Impressions**: +39% (414/day → 574/day)
- ✅ **Clicks**: +23% (73/day → 90/day)
- ⚠️ **CTR**: -10% (17.60% → 15.76%) - Expected with broader match
- ⚠️ **CPC**: +9% (£0.34 → £0.37)
- ✅ **ROAS**: +80% (173% → 312%)

AI Max expanded reach successfully. When combined with the September 17th landing page optimization, the campaign ROAS jumped from 137% (Aug) to 414% (Sept) to 385% (Oct).

**Important Context:**
The Self Catering campaign shows how AI Max (reach expansion) + landing page optimization (conversion improvement) work together to create compounding results. AI Max brought more traffic, landing page optimization converted that traffic better.

**November 3rd: Account-Wide Rollout - VALIDATED APPROACH**

After proving the concept over 3 months, we rolled out AI Max to ALL Search campaigns:
- Devonshire Arms Hotel Search
- Cavendish Search
- The Beeley Inn Search
- The Pilsley Inn Search
- The Fell Search
- Chatsworth Inns Search
- Bolton Abbey Locations Search

**Why We're Confident:**
The Locations campaign results (+226% ROAS improvement) and Self Catering volume growth (+39% impressions) prove AI Max works for your account. We're now scaling this success across all properties.

**Timeline for Full Results:**
- **December Report**: Early impact from November 3rd rollout (4+ weeks of data)
- **January Report**: Full 8-week analysis of account-wide implementation
- **February Report**: Quarterly review showing cumulative benefit across entire account

### 3. Budget Optimization - October 20th
- **Devonshire Arms Hotel Search**: +£30/day (now £78/day)
- **P Max All Properties**: +£50/day (now £125/day)
- **Why**: Both hitting daily budgets, turning away profitable clicks
- **Tracking**: Measuring if additional spend delivers proportional bookings

### 4. ROAS Target Adjustment - October 24th
- **Change**: Increased target from 550% to 570%
- **Why**: Campaigns trending above target, needed to control spend rate
- **Result**: Successfully paced to October budget while maintaining profitability

### 5. November Budget Adjustments - November 3rd
- **Challenge**: Month rolled over on Friday, campaigns ran 3 days at high October budgets
- **Impact**: £1,427 spend in first 3 days (163% of target pacing)
- **Solution**: Reduced all campaign budgets on Monday to pace correctly for remaining 28 days
- **Target**: £272/day to hit £9,000 November budget exactly

### 6. Platform Issue Escalation - Ongoing
- **Issue**: The Beeley Inn and The Pilsley Inn P Max asset groups showing warnings
- **Action**: Escalated to Google support, tracking resolution
- **Impact**: Asset groups still serving, but may not be at full potential
- **Status**: Known platform bug affecting multiple advertisers

## Key Metrics Definitions

**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: Revenue ÷ Cost × 100. Example: £5,500 revenue from £1,000 spend = 550% ROAS.

**Conversion Rate**: (Conversions ÷ Clicks) × 100. Measures how many people who click your ad complete a booking.

**CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100. Measures how appealing your ads are to searchers.

**CPC (Cost Per Click)**: Total Cost ÷ Clicks. Average amount paid each time someone clicks your ad.

**Impression Share**: Percentage of available impressions your ads received. Below 100% means you're missing opportunities (usually due to budget or rank).

**AI Max (Automated Keywords)**: Google Ads feature that automatically generates additional keyword variations based on your existing keywords and landing page content.
