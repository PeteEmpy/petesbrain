## Implementation Notes

**Bolton Abbey Locations:**
- Pause campaign (zero conversions, zero value)
- £11/day freed up for reallocation
- Consider future review: Is there potential to improve performance, or should this location be removed entirely?

**Budget Reallocation:**
- Implement immediately to capture booking opportunities for remainder of November
- Review impact after 14 days (Dec 2, 2025)
- Monitor ROAS and budget lost impression share for reallocated budget

**Expected Results:**
- Maintain or improve overall portfolio ROAS (both campaigns exceed 570% target)
- Capture missed bookings currently lost to budget constraints
- More efficient use of budget (0% ROAS → 695-1,049% ROAS)

## Context from Recent Changes

From tasks-completed.md, the following budget increases were implemented on Nov 17:
- The Fell: £21 → £26 (+£5)
- Devonshire Arms: £42 → £52 (+£10)
- Cavendish: £40 → £48 (+£8)

**Key Insight:** Even after these increases, Cavendish (49% lost IS) and Devonshire Arms (44% lost IS) remain heavily budget-constrained. This confirms these two campaigns can absorb additional budget efficiently.
