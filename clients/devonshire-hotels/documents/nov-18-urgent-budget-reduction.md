# URGENT: November Budget Overspend - Reduction Required
**Date:** 2025-11-18
**Priority:** P0 - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

---

## Current Situation

**November Budget:** £9,000
**Spent (Nov 1-18):** £5,788.55
**Remaining Budget:** £3,211.45
**Days Remaining:** 12 (Nov 19-30)
**Required Daily Spend:** £267.62/day

**Current Daily Budgets:** £319/day (after Bolton Abbey pause)
**Overspend Rate:** +£51.38/day
**Projected Overspend:** **£616.56** (12 days × £51.38)

**Projected Month-End Spend:** £9,616.56 (107% of budget) ❌

---

## Problem

Even with Bolton Abbey Locations paused and budget reallocated to Cavendish, we're still £51/day over pace.

**Why:**
- Campaigns consistently spending at or above daily budgets
- Recent budget increases (Nov 17: Fell, Dev Arms, Cavendish)
- Strong November performance driving spend velocity

---

## Solution: Reduce Budgets by £51/day

**Target:** Get to £267/day total across all campaigns

### Recommended Reductions

**Priority 1: Reduce highest spenders proportionally**

| Campaign | Current Budget | Reduction | New Budget |
|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **P Max All** | £66/day | -£10 | **£56/day** |
| **Cavendish** | £59/day | -£9 | **£50/day** |
| **Dev Arms** | £52/day | -£8 | **£44/day** |
| **Beeley** | £29/day | -£5 | **£24/day** |
| **The Fell** | £26/day | -£4 | **£22/day** |
| **Chatsworth Inns** | £25/day | -£4 | **£21/day** |
| **Pilsley** | £24/day | -£4 | **£20/day** |
| **Chatsworth SC** | £18/day | -£3 | **£15/day** |
| **Chatsworth Locations** | £16/day | -£2 | **£14/day** |
| **Bolton Abbey SC** | £9/day | -£2 | **£7/day** |

**Total Reduction:** £51/day ✅

**NEW TOTAL DAILY BUDGET:** £268/day

---

## Expected Outcome

**Remaining Days:** 12 (Nov 19-30)
**New Daily Spend:** £268/day
**Projected Remaining Spend:** £3,216 (12 days × £268)
**Total November Spend:** £5,788.55 + £3,216 = **£9,004.55**

**Result:** Hit budget target (£9,000) with £4.55 variance (0.05% margin) ✅

---

## Impact Assessment

**Cavendish Test:**
- Cavendish budget reduced from £59 to £50 (vs planned £59 test)
- Test still valid: £50 is £2 higher than original £48
- Still provides +£2/day above pre-reallocation baseline
- Budget lost IS may not reduce as much as hoped, but test data still useful

**Campaign Performance:**
- All campaigns remain healthy with adequate budgets
- Proportional reductions minimize impact on any single campaign
- ROAS targets unchanged (570% portfolio strategy)
- Campaigns maintain competitiveness

---

## Alternative Approach (If Client Objects)

**Option 2: Pause Bolton Abbey Self Catering**
- Currently £9/day budget
- Zero conversions Nov 1-18 (mentioned in analysis)
- If paused, reduces by additional £9/day
- Would allow keeping Cavendish at £59 with smaller cuts elsewhere

**Option 3: Split Reduction**
- Pause Bolton Abbey SC (£9/day saved)
- Reduce other campaigns by £42/day (instead of £51/day)
- Keeps Cavendish closer to £59 test budget

## Client Communication

**Message to Helen/Rachael:**

"Quick update on November budgets: After analysis, we're tracking to overspend by ~£617 if we continue at current pace. I've prepared budget adjustments (-£51/day across campaigns) to bring us back to the £9,000 target. This includes slight reduction to Cavendish test budget (£59 → £50), but still £2 above the original £48, so test remains valid.

Alternative: We could pause Bolton Abbey Self Catering (zero conversions) which would allow keeping Cavendish higher. Let me know your preference and I'll implement today."
