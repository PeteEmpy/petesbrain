### Before Asset Changes (1-25 November 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Spend** | £1,753.18 |
| **Conversions** | 16.0 |
| **Revenue** | £10,782.71 |
| **ROAS** | **615%** |

### After Asset Changes (26 Nov - 15 Dec 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Spend** | £1,311.41 |
| **Conversions** | 7.0 |
| **Revenue** | £4,605.01 |
| **ROAS** | **351%** |
| **Cost per Conversion** | £187.34 |

### ⚠️ Performance Impact

| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| **ROAS** | **-264 percentage points** (-43% decline) |
| **Conversion Rate** | -71% worse (cost per conversion increased 71%) |
| **Revenue** | **-£6,177.70** (-57% decline) |

**⚠️ CRITICAL DECISION**: Performance decline is significant, but December seasonality + conversion lag make this evaluation **premature**. **Re-test scheduled for 15 January 2026** when post-holiday booking patterns normalize and conversion lag clears.

**If January ROAS remains <400%**: Revert to original asset set and document learnings.

   - Strong performer despite lower impression volume

### What's Not Working ❌

1. **Long Headlines** - Across all 3 properties
   - Getting minimal impressions (under 500, often under 100)
   - Virtually 0 clicks when they do serve
   - Google's algorithm not favouring them in auction

2. **Generic Luxury Language**
   - "Luxury Rooms in Derbyshire" - 2.02% CTR (significantly below average)
   - Vague statements underperform specific benefits

3. **The Fell - Conversion Issue** ⚠️
   - Assets performing well (10-17% CTR on many)
   - But ROAS only 142% vs 297-744% for other properties
   - **This is NOT an asset problem - investigate landing pages and conversion tracking**

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Priority 1: Refresh Long Headlines

**All 3 asset groups** - Long headlines not competitive. Replace with:
- Award/recognition statements (shorter format)
- Location + benefit combinations
- Specific amenities (spa, dining, activities)

**Examples for The Cavendish:**
- "The Times Hotel of the Year - Luxury Peak District Escape"
- "4-Star Chatsworth Estate Hotel with Award-Winning Dining"
- "Derbyshire Luxury Hotel - Historic Charm Meets Modern Comfort"

### Priority 2: Amplify What's Working

Add more headlines focusing on:
- **Awards**: "2 AA Rosettes", "Michelin Recommendations" (if applicable)
- **Estate/Location**: More specific geographic hooks
- **Specific Benefits**: Dog-friendly, spa access, helicopter pad (unique differentiators)

### Priority 3: Investigate The Fell Conversion Path

Asset performance is **excellent** (10-17% CTR), but ROAS is **poor (142%)**. Investigate:
- Landing page relevance for The Fell
- Booking path friction
- Price competitiveness
- Conversion tracking accuracy

This is not an asset optimization issue - the text assets are performing very well at driving clicks.

### Priority 4: Test CTA-Focused Headlines

"Check Availability Online Now" achieved **11.46% CTR**. Test more direct CTA headlines:
- "Book Your Stay Today"
- "View Rooms & Availability"
- "Check Latest Offers"

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Week of 16th Dec**: Draft new long headline options for all 3 properties
2. **Week of 23rd Dec**: Implement new long headlines (replace underperformers)
3. **January 2025**:
   - Monitor long headline performance improvement
   - Deep-dive into The Fell conversion path (separate investigation)
   - A/B test CTA-focused headlines
