## ✓ Campaign-Specific Recommendations

### Priority 1: Pause Zero-Conversion Campaigns

**Chatsworth Escapes Locations** (£198 spend, 0 conversions)
- **Action:** Pause immediately
- **Reason:** Two consecutive months of zero conversions
- **Savings:** ~£400/month

**The Pilsley Inn** (£135.61 spend, 0 conversions)
- **Action:** Pause or reduce budget by 75%
- **Reason:** Consistent underperformance (zero conversions in Nov/Dec)
- **Savings:** ~£270/month (if paused) or £200/month (if reduced)

---

### Priority 2: Scale The Beeley Inn

**Current Performance:** 828% ROAS (far exceeds 570% target)

**Budget Test Recommendations:**
1. **Week 1 (16-22 Dec):** Increase to £25/day (+£7/day)
2. **Week 2 (23-29 Dec):** If ROAS holds above 600%, increase to £33/day (+£8/day)
3. **January:** If ROAS holds above 570%, increase to £40/day (+£7/day)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Month 1 additional spend: +£300
- Month 1 additional revenue: +£2,484 (828% ROAS maintained)
- Risk: ROAS may decline slightly as budget scales, but target cushion is significant (258 points above target)

---

### Priority 3: Investigate Devonshire Arms Underperformance

**Current:** £1,094.39 spend, 257% ROAS (highest spend, lowest ROAS)

**Possible Issues:**
- Budget too high for available inventory (forcing low-quality traffic)
- Keyword/search term quality issues
- Landing page conversion issues
- Competition intensity

**Action Plan:**
1. Review search terms report (week of 16 Dec)
2. Check auction insights for competitive landscape
3. Consider reducing budget by 20% (£200/month) to improve efficiency
4. Reallocate savings to The Beeley Inn

---

### Priority 4: Monitor Performance Max Asset Test

**Current:** £874.76 spend, 183% ROAS (significantly below target)

**Context:** Asset optimization test launched Nov 26
**Decision:** Hold until mid-January (seasonal factors + conversion lag)

**Action:** No budget changes until Jan 15, 2026 re-evaluation

---

## ✓ Historical Context - October Learning

**From October budget test:**
- **Devonshire Arms (Brand Search)** scaled 2-3x budget successfully (achieved 4,006% incremental ROAS)
- **Performance Max** failed to scale (achieved only 573% on incremental spend)

**Application to December Recommendations:**
- The Beeley Inn shows similar high-ROAS characteristics to successful Dev Arms Oct test
- Confidence level: HIGH that scaling will maintain strong ROAS

## ✓ Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
✅ Pausing Chatsworth Escapes Locations (0 conversions for 2 months)
✅ Pausing The Pilsley Inn (0 conversions for 2 months)
✅ Scaling The Beeley Inn (828% ROAS, 258 points above target)

### Medium Risk
⚠️ Reducing Dev Arms budget (highest spend campaign, but ROAS is poor)
⚠️ P Max asset changes (test ongoing, re-evaluate in January)

### High Risk
❌ Making budget changes during Christmas period (seasonal anomaly)
❌ Scaling campaigns beyond 2x current budget without testing

**Recommendation:** Implement Option 1 (revenue-neutral) immediately. Review January data before implementing Option 2.
