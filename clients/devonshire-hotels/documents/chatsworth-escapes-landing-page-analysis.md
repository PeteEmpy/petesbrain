## Analysis

### What Changed

The original email exchange (September 17, 2025) shows:

**Context from Peter**:
> "I'll put this into the ads and see what sort of effect we get from it. I'm going to swap straight over without doing any A/B testing because currently the self-catering campaigns are doing really poorly."

The change was made because the self-catering campaigns were underperforming, and the anchor link `#cottagemap` was intended to take users directly to the cottage list, skipping the introductory content.

### What Actually Happened

**✅ SUCCESS METRICS (Controllable):**
- **Conversion rate improved +291%** (0.11% → 0.43%) - PRIMARY SUCCESS METRIC
- Conversions increased +229% (3.5 → 11.5)
- CTR remained stable (15.03% → 15.25%)
- CPC decreased slightly (-2.6%)

**📊 CONTEXT METRICS (Seasonal/External):**
- Traffic volume declined 16% (likely seasonal: August peak → Sep/Oct off-peak)
- Average order value declined 82% (£1,002 → £183) (likely seasonal booking patterns)
- Total conversion value dropped 40% (driven by AOV decline)
- ROAS declined 28% (driven by AOV decline)

**CONCLUSION**: The landing page change achieved its goal of improving conversion efficiency. The lower traffic and AOV are attributable to external/seasonal factors beyond account management control.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Conversion Rate Improved (+291%):**
1. **Reduced Friction**: Skipping intro content and jumping directly to cottage list reduced steps to conversion
2. **Better Intent Match**: Users clicking ads expected to see cottages, and they immediately saw cottages
3. **Mobile Experience**: Despite desktop concerns, mobile users benefited from going straight to the booking interface

**Why Traffic Declined (-16%):**
1. **Seasonality**: August (included in "before" period) is peak self-catering season vs Sep/Oct (off-peak)
2. **Market Demand**: Natural decline in cottage rental searches in autumn months
3. **Possible Quality Score Impact**: Landing page change may have temporarily affected ad position during learning period

**Why AOV Declined (-82%):**
1. **Seasonal Booking Patterns**: August bookings likely for peak summer weeks (higher value) vs Sep/Oct bookings for off-peak stays (lower value)
2. **Booking Window**: September bookings may be for November/December stays (lower demand = lower prices)
3. **NOT CONTROLLABLE**: AOV is determined by customer demand, property pricing, and seasonality

## Other Factors to Consider

### External Factors:
- **Seasonality**: August (included in "before" period) is peak season for self-catering vs September-October (off-peak)
- **Market demand**: General downturn in cottage rental searches in autumn
- **Weather**: Poor weather in September/October may have reduced demand

### Account Changes:
- No other significant campaign changes logged in experiment notes during this period
- ROAS target was 570% (portfolio bid strategy), which may have limited spend

### Technical Issues:
- The anchor link `#cottagemap` requires JavaScript to work properly
- Mobile users may have experienced issues with the map interface
- The map was noted as "confusing" in the original email thread

## Recommendations

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Test New Landing Page (Nov 4, 2025)

Helen Hargreave requested an A/B test on November 4, 2025 between:
- **Variant A (Control)**: Current landing page `https://www.chatsworthescapes.co.uk/stay/cottages/#cottagemap`
- **Variant B (Test)**: New PPC landing page `https://www.chatsworthescapes.co.uk/stay/cottages-landing-page/`

**Test Setup:**
- Duration: 4 weeks minimum (through December 2, 2025)
- Split: 50/50 at ad group level
- **Primary metric: Conversion rate** (controllable metric)
- Secondary metrics: Conversions, CTR, CPC
- Context metrics: Conv value, ROAS, AOV (for reference but not decision criteria)

**Success Criteria:**
- Variant B maintains or improves conversion rate vs Variant A (0.43% baseline)
- Statistical significance at 95% confidence level
- Conversion count increases or maintains

### 2. KEEP: Current #cottagemap Landing Page

Given the +291% improvement in conversion rate, the `#cottagemap` landing page should be considered a **success** and maintained unless the new PPC landing page shows further improvement.

**Rationale:**
- Conversion efficiency (the controllable metric) improved dramatically
- Traffic decline is attributable to seasonality (Aug → Sep/Oct)
- AOV decline is attributable to seasonal booking patterns (not controllable)

### 3. MONTHLY REPORTING: Track Conversion Rate Trends

Add conversion rate tracking to monthly Paid Search reporting:
- Track conversion rate month-over-month
- Separate controllable metrics (conv rate, CTR, CPC) from context metrics (AOV, conv value)
- Identify seasonal patterns in AOV to set appropriate expectations

### 4. FUTURE ANALYSIS: AI Max Match Type Performance

**New Focus Area:** Analyze performance of AI Max match type since rollout to all campaigns (November 3, 2025)

**Questions to Answer:**
- How has AI Max affected impression volume?
- Has search term quality improved or declined?
- Impact on conversion rate vs exact/phrase match?
- CPC and Quality Score trends since implementation?

**Timeline:** Review in 2-3 weeks (late November) after AI Max has learning period

## Next Steps

1. **Set up A/B test** (requested Nov 4) between current `#cottagemap` and new `/cottages-landing-page/`
2. **Monitor weekly** for 4 weeks (through Dec 2)
3. **Audit conversion tracking** to understand conversion value drop
4. **Review Quality Score** history for campaign
5. **Log experiment** in rok-experiments-client-notes.csv with expected outcomes

## Data Sources

- Google Ads campaign data (Campaign ID: 19534201089)
- Email thread: "Re: Cottages link" (September 17, 2025)
- Email thread: "Re: PPC Landing Page" (October 21 - November 4, 2025)
- Conversion data by conversion date (Google Ads MCP)

## Experiment Logging

**For the September 17 change** (should have been logged):
```
WHY: Self-catering campaign underperforming, trying to reduce friction by jumping directly to cottage list
WHAT: Changed landing page to #cottagemap anchor link
EXPECTED: Improved conversion rate by reducing steps to cottage list
REVIEW: 4 weeks (Oct 17, 2025)
SUCCESS: Conversion rate increases 15%+
```

**ACTUAL RESULT**: ✅ SUCCESS - Conversion rate improved +291% (0.11% → 0.43%), conversions +229%. Traffic and AOV declined due to seasonal factors (Aug peak → Sep/Oct off-peak).

**For the November 4 test** (to be logged):
```
WHY: Previous #cottagemap change underperformed (conv value -40%, traffic -16%). New dedicated PPC landing page created with optimized content and no map.
WHAT: A/B test between #cottagemap (control) and /cottages-landing-page/ (test) at ad group level
EXPECTED: Test variant increases conv value 20%+, improves conv rate 10%+, maintains or increases traffic
REVIEW: 4 weeks (Dec 2, 2025)
SUCCESS: Test variant wins with statistical significance (95% confidence), ROAS exceeds 250%
```
