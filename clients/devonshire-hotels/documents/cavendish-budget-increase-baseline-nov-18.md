## Monthly Report Presentation

**Narrative for Client:**

"On November 18th, we paused the Bolton Abbey Locations campaign (zero conversions, £179.96 spend with no return) and reallocated the £11/day budget to the Cavendish campaign. Cavendish was heavily budget-constrained with 49% of potential bookings being missed due to daily budget limits, while maintaining exceptional 695% ROAS.

**Results (Nov 18-30):**
- [To be filled at month-end]
- Revenue impact: £[X] additional revenue
- ROAS maintained: [X]%
- Impression share improved: [X]% → [X]%
- Additional bookings captured: [X]

This test demonstrates that reallocating budget from non-performing campaigns to high-ROAS, budget-constrained campaigns delivers immediate revenue gains without additional spend."
