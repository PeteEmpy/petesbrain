## Category 1: ZERO CONVERSION KEYWORDS - PAUSE IMMEDIATELY

**Total waste: £2,319 (90 days) = £773/month**

### Castles Campaigns (Lismore & The Hall)
**Campaign wastage: £960 - Recommend pausing both campaigns entirely**

| Keyword | Match Type | Campaign | Spend | Clicks | Impr | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| castles to rent ireland | BROAD | Lismore | £384 | 341 | 5,162 | ❌ PAUSE |
| bolton abbey hall | BROAD | The Hall | £289 | 151 | 4,118 | ❌ PAUSE |
| castle vacation ireland | EXACT | Lismore | £137 | 45 | 291 | ❌ PAUSE |
| lismore castle | EXACT | Lismore | £101 | 147 | 1,165 | ❌ PAUSE |
| large country house for hire | EXACT | The Hall | £86 | 48 | 860 | ❌ PAUSE |
| the hall at bolton abbey | BROAD | The Hall | £63 | 53 | 1,056 | ❌ PAUSE |

**Finding:** Both Castles campaigns (Lismore, The Hall) mentioned in Nov 13 meeting as having zero conversions. This data confirms it - £489 spend in 90 days, zero conversions.

---

### Self-Catering Campaigns
**Wastage: £312**

| Keyword | Match Type | Campaign | Spend | Clicks | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| luxurious cottage | EXACT | Chatsworth SC | £200 | 154 | ❌ PAUSE |
| peak district holiday cottages | BROAD | Chatsworth SC | £111 | 199 | ❌ PAUSE |
| chatsworth estate holiday cottages | EXACT | Chatsworth SC | £52 | 212 | ⚠️ REVIEW (good CTR) |
| chatsworth cottages dog friendly | BROAD | Chatsworth SC | £66 | 128 | ❌ PAUSE |
| chatsworth estate cottages to rent | BROAD | Chatsworth SC | £57 | 155 | ❌ PAUSE |

**Finding:** "Luxurious cottage" is too generic - not attracting Chatsworth-specific bookers.

---

### The Hide Campaign
**Wastage: £278**

| Keyword | Match Type | Spend | Clicks | Conversions | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| the hide hotel chesterfield | EXACT | £158 | 342 | 0 | ⚠️ REVIEW (tracking?) |
| the hide hotel eastmoor | BROAD | £60 | 398 | 0 | ❌ PAUSE |
| beeley accommodation | BROAD | £60 | 171 | 0 | ❌ PAUSE (wrong property) |

**Note:** The Hide conversion tracking went live early November. Need exact date from Gary to determine if these should be paused or given more time.

---

### Cavendish Campaign
**Wastage: £355**

| Keyword | Match Type | Spend | Clicks | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| bed and breakfast baslow | BROAD | £150 | 164 | ❌ PAUSE |
| country hotels uk | EXACT | £121 | 66 | ❌ PAUSE (too generic) |

**Wastage: £81**

| Keyword | Match Type | Spend | Clicks | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| hotels in beeley | BROAD | £81 | 126 | ❌ PAUSE |

---

### Chatsworth Locations Campaign
**Wastage: £246**

| Keyword | Match Type | Spend | Clicks | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| luxury hotels peak district | EXACT | £71 | - | ❌ PAUSE |
| holidays in derbyshire peak district | BROAD | £67 | 137 | ❌ PAUSE |
| peak district getaways | BROAD | £54 | 100 | ❌ PAUSE |
| hotel peak district | BROAD | £54 | 81 | ❌ PAUSE |

### Chatsworth Inns Campaign
**Wastage: £183**

|---------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| chatsworth pubs with rooms | BROAD | £129 | 276 | ❌ PAUSE |

---

### Weddings Campaign
**Wastage: £443**

| Keyword | Match Type | Spend | Clicks | Conv Value | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| getting married bolton abbey | BROAD | £117 | 155 | £0 | ❌ PAUSE |
| tithe barn bolton abbey | EXACT | £92 | 70 | £0 | ❌ PAUSE |
| wedding yorkshire | BROAD | £92 | 69 | £0 | ❌ PAUSE |
| countryside wedding yorkshire | BROAD | £89 | 47 | £0 | ❌ PAUSE |
| luxury wedding yorkshire | BROAD | £53 | 51 | £0 | ❌ PAUSE |

**Note:** Weddings campaign has conversion value tracking issue (£1-2 per conversion instead of actual venue hire value). However, zero conversions indicates these keywords aren't working regardless of tracking.

---

## Category 2: VERY LOW ROAS (< 200%) - REVIEW & LIKELY PAUSE

**Target ROAS: 570% | Minimum acceptable: 200%**

| Keyword | Campaign | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Conv | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|------|------|--------|
| luxury wedding venues uk | Weddings | £564 | £5 | **0.9%** | 5 | ❌ PAUSE (tracking issue + poor) |
| pilsley pubs | Pilsley Inn | £307 | £393 | **128%** | 1 | ⚠️ REVIEW |
| yorkshire holiday cottages | Bolton Abbey SC | £239 | £465 | **195%** | 1 | ⚠️ REVIEW |
| fell hotel | The Fell | £201 | £701 | **349%** | 1.5 | ⚠️ KEEP (below target but converting) |

**Finding:** "luxury wedding venues uk" has disastrous 0.9% ROAS even with tracking issues.

---

## Category 3: DUPLICATE KEYWORDS (Internal Competition)

### "pilsley pubs" - APPEARS IN TWO CAMPAIGNS

**Campaign 1:** The Pilsley Inn
- Spend: £307 | Revenue: £393 | ROAS: **128%** | Conv: 1

**Campaign 2:** Chatsworth Escapes Inns & Hotels
- Spend: £80 | Revenue: £1,262 | ROAS: **1,587%** | Conv: 2.33

**Action:**
- ✅ KEEP in Chatsworth Escapes Inns (1,587% ROAS!)
- ❌ PAUSE in Pilsley Inn (128% ROAS)
- Add negative keyword "pilsley pubs" to Pilsley Inn campaign

**Why this matters:** Same keyword in two campaigns causes internal auction competition, driving up CPCs and confusing which property to show.

---

## Category 4: UNDERPERFORMING BUT CONVERTING

These keywords are below 570% target but above 200% minimum. Monitor closely.

| Keyword | Campaign | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Conv | Action |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|------|------|--------|
| the hide chesterfield | The Hide | £464 | £1,179 | **254%** | 2 | ⏳ WAIT (tracking went live Nov) |
| chatsworth cottages EXACT | Self Catering | £251 | £848 | **338%** | 1.5 | ⏳ MONITOR |
| fell hotel | The Fell | £201 | £701 | **349%** | 1.5 | ⏳ MONITOR |

## Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)

**1. Pause Castles Campaigns Entirely (£960 waste)**
- DEV | Castles | Lismore
- DEV | Castles | The Hall
- **Reason:** Zero conversions in 90 days, £489 spend
- **Already discussed:** Nov 13 meeting noted these have zero conversions

**2. Pause Zero-Conversion Keywords (£1,359 waste)**
- Self-Catering: 4 keywords (£286)
- Cavendish: 3 keywords (£355)
- Weddings: 5 keywords (£443)
- Chatsworth Locations: 4 keywords (£246)
- Chatsworth Inns: 2 keywords (£183)
- Beeley: 1 keyword (£81)

**3. Fix Duplicate Keyword Issue**
- Pause "pilsley pubs" in Pilsley Inn campaign
- Keep in Chatsworth Escapes Inns (1,587% ROAS vs 128% ROAS)

**Expected savings:** £773/month

---

### WAIT FOR TRACKING DATA (The Hide)

**The Hide keywords to review after Gary provides tracking go-live date:**
- "the hide hotel chesterfield" (£158, 0 conv)
- "the hide hotel eastmoor" (£60, 0 conv)
- If tracking went live after Nov 1: Give until Dec 1 to assess
- If tracking went live before Oct 15: Pause immediately (had time to convert)

---

### MONITOR CLOSELY (Next 30 Days)

**Low ROAS but converting - review end of November:**
- "pilsley pubs" (Pilsley): 128% ROAS - LIKELY PAUSE
- "yorkshire holiday cottages" (Bolton Abbey SC): 195% ROAS - LIKELY PAUSE
- "fell hotel" (The Fell): 349% ROAS - MONITOR (converting steadily)

---

## Additional Findings

### 1. Weddings Campaign Conversion Tracking Issue CONFIRMED

**Evidence:**
- "luxury wedding venues uk": £564 spend, 5 conversions, **£5 total value** = £1/conversion
- "getting married yorkshire": £287 spend, 3 conversions, **£3 total value** = £1/conversion
- "bolton abbey weddings": £154 spend, 2 conversions, **£2 total value** = £1/conversion

**This is clearly wrong** - wedding venue enquiries should have higher value. Fix tracking before assessing Weddings campaign ROI properly.

---

### 2. Strong Performers (Keep & Possibly Increase Budget)

| Keyword | Campaign | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Conv |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|------|------|
| best hotels peak district | Chatsworth Locations | £55 | £1,747 | **3,176%** | 2 |
| derbyshire holiday | Chatsworth Locations | £149 | £920 | **614%** | 1.83 |
| chatsworth escapes | Self Catering | £155 | £1,589 | **1,026%** | 3 |
| pilsley pubs | Chatsworth Inns | £80 | £1,262 | **1,587%** | 2.33 |

**These are the types of keywords to protect and potentially expand.**

6. **Monitor low ROAS keywords** for final decision
7. **Update CONTEXT.md** with decisions made

### Early December

8. **Fix Weddings conversion tracking** (if client wants to continue campaign)
9. **Assess The Hide keywords** now that tracking data is available
10. **Monthly report** should show budget savings from pauses

## Budget Impact Projection

**Current state (90 days):**
- Total waste: £3,107
- Monthly waste: £1,035

**After implementing recommendations:**
- Immediate savings: £773/month (zero-conversion keywords)
- Potential additional: £262/month (low ROAS keywords after review)
- **Total potential savings: £1,035/month**

**Where to reallocate saved budget:**
- High performers already identified in Nov 17 budget increases (The Fell, Dev Arms, Cavendish)
- Those campaigns increased by £23/day = £690/month
- Pausing wastage frees up £1,035/month - MORE than enough to cover increases

**Net effect:** Budget becomes more efficient, hitting same overall spend but with higher ROAS.
