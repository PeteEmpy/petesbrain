## Impact on Cavendish Test

**Cavendish Budget Journey:**
- Original (Nov 1-17): £48/day
- After reallocation (Nov 18 AM): £59/day (Bolton Abbey £11 added)
- After reduction (Nov 18 PM): £50/day

**Test Status:** Still valid
- £50/day is £2 above original £48 baseline
- Provides some incremental budget for testing
- Not the full £59 hoped for, but budget constraints necessitate this

---

## Rationale

**Why revenue-proportional?**
1. **Fair:** Higher revenue campaigns have proven ability to convert
2. **Lower risk:** Campaigns generating more revenue can absorb cuts better
3. **Maintains balance:** All campaigns reduced proportionally
4. **Protects emerging performers:** Smaller revenue campaigns get smaller cuts

**Why this protects overall performance:**
- P Max and Dev Arms (highest revenue) take biggest cuts but maintain healthy budgets
- All campaigns maintain competitive daily budgets
- No campaign gets cut so severely it can't function
- Self-catering protected entirely (as requested)

---

## Expected Outcome

**Remaining 12 days (Nov 19-30):**
- New daily spend: £253/day
- Projected spend: £3,036 (12 days × £253)
- **Total November:** £5,943.90 + £3,036 = **£8,979.90** ✅

**Result:** Hit £9,000 target with £20 margin (0.2% under budget)

## Client Communication

**Message:**

"Budget update: We're tracking to overspend by £906 if we continue at current pace (£315/day vs £255/day target). I've prepared budget adjustments that reduce property campaigns proportionally based on revenue contribution - higher revenue campaigns take proportionally larger cuts while maintaining their competitive position.

This protects self-catering campaigns entirely and ensures all property campaigns maintain healthy budgets to compete effectively. The reductions bring us to £253/day, which puts us on track to hit the £9,000 November target.

Note: This affects the Cavendish test budget (£59 → £50), but it still provides £2/day above the original £48 baseline, so we'll still get useful test data."
