## NMA: Fix Disapproved Sitelinks and Create Replacements
**Completed:** 2025-11-17 17:00
**Source:** Campaign Audit (Anwisha comments) & NMA 3-Week Improvement Plan

**Account:** National Motorsport Academy (NMA) - Customer ID: 5622468019

**Context:**
Two sitelinks were disapproved following account audit and Anwisha's review comments. Created two new sitelinks to replace them as part of Week 1 Quick Wins from the NMA 3-Week Improvement Plan (Nov 18-24 tasks).

**Disapproved Sitelinks (Removed):**

1. **"Course Guide Download"**
   - Issue: Typo in description - "Earn as Your Learn" (grammatically incorrect)
   - Policy violation: Editorial standards
   - Status: Removed/replaced

2. **"Motorsport Engineering"**
   - Issue: Generic CTA - "Find Out More" (not specific enough)
   - Policy violation: Low quality/vague messaging
   - Status: Removed/replaced

**New Sitelinks Created (Today - Nov 17):**
- 2 new sitelinks created to replace disapproved ones
- Compliant with Google Ads editorial standards
- Specific CTAs and error-free descriptions
- Applied to active NMA campaigns

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ Remove policy warnings from account
- ✅ Minor Quality Score improvement
- ✅ Better ad relevance and CTR
- ✅ Clearer messaging for prospective students

**Strategic Context:**
Part of broader NMA optimization strategy following comprehensive audit completed Nov 17. Disapproved sitelinks were limiting ad extensions visibility and creating policy warnings. This fix is part of Week 1 (Nov 18-24) "Quick Wins & Data Gathering" phase.

**Related Work:**
- NMA Campaign Conversion Audit (Nov 17) identified need for sitelinks expansion
- 3-Week Improvement Plan calls for 30+ sitelinks across active campaigns
- This fix addresses immediate policy issue before broader sitelink rollout

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor sitelink approval status (should approve within 24-48 hours)
- Week 2: Add 4-6 sitelinks per campaign (target: 30+ total)
- Focus on Engineering and Management campaigns for maximum impact
