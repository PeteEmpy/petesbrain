- 'Them: Peter.'
- 'Me: Sorry. I just get my video on. All this playing funny Packers. You see me okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Can''t see you. Right. Why is that? There we go. Bright and breezy this morning.'
- 'Them: Very good. Do I?'
- 'Me: Yeah. It''s usually because I''m speaking about midnight or something.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I wish.'
- 'Them: Hi. Hi. How are you?'
- 'Me: Good. Thank you. Ready for Christmas. Let''s get this thing out the way with.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I was talking to someone the other day who''s in Saudi, said it was quite amazing
  how little. Well, there is nothing, absolutely nothing. You go down our road at
  the moment, there''s just lights everywhere. He said there''s not an inkling of
  it anywhere. Not even from the expat community. Is it about the same there?'
- 'Them: No, no, it''s. Christmas is everywhere here.'
- 'Me: Oh, is it?'
- 'Them: You can''t. You can''t miss it. It''s. There''s a radio show, 92 Dubai. 92.
  I listened to most of the time, and it''s all Christmas songs now.'
- 'Me: Really?'
- 'Them: All the malls are all Christmas and yeah.'
- 'Me: Nice. Oh, very nice.'
- 'Them: When I was in Canada, it used to be a nightmare to shop. Actually, every
  time you''re in a mall it''s Christmas songs. But in Dubai, I always gift it. Firstly,
  I don''t go to shopping malls. So that''s the relevant of my life. That''s done.'
- 'Me: That''s a good idea.'
- 'Them: With.'
- 'Me: The more people like Joan, we should buy online. Thank you.'
- 'Them: It''s like. Buy online. Yeah, just. Just leave all of it out of the way.
  Listen to your own music. You''re good.'
- 'Me: Lovely. Or we''re going to go way between Christmas and New Year. Get away
  from the madness. As usual. In the middle of Kilda Forest, just miles from anywhere.
  Very nice. Yes, I am a grinch.'
- 'Them: Yes, now it sounds good to me. Sounds good to me. I keep having. Oh, it''s
  raining. There''s water falling from the sky.'
- 'Me: Really?'
- 'Them: I''m we sure? What''s going on? I haven''t seen that for months. The water
  hasn''t fall from the sky out here, so it''s very specific. To you. It''s probably
  coming your way. I''m Jamera partway, so. All right. It''s coming to you. It''s
  coming to you. Yeah. Started on the front of the house and it''s coming to the back
  or the other way around. From a tropical country. It''s very strange when I don''t
  see rainfall all the. It''s not okay. I''m. I''m from a reigning country. It just
  rains and it''s very. It''s very odd.'
- 'Me: Yep. Straight ahead.'
- 'Them: It''s odd when there''s no rain.'
- 'Me: It''s really wet here at the moment. There''s been some nasty flooding up in
  the Lake District. So, yeah, it''s not great.'
- 'Them: We''ve actually got gills. So the. The Brits. It rains so much, we''ve actually
  developed gills over time.'
- 'Me: I can imagine there people are running out in the street going, oh.'
- 'Them: I think people here have gotten really terrified of rain. So ever since that
  happened, I believe it was last year or the year before that. And like, are there
  all the purchase at the Bentleys kind of just went underwater because the city is
  not equipped for rain.'
- 'Me: W. Ow.'
- 'Them: So anytime there''s even a little bit, it''s like we get alerts, like nationwide
  alerts to everyone''s cell phones. There. There might be rain. And I''m just like,
  it''s just a little rain.'
- 'Me: Really? We get alerts when it''s not raining today. Nice one.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: So I thought. I thought I''d save this meeting for the last one pretty much
  of the year, because we want to have a. Have a tweet with the budgets, but I don''t
  want to tweak them too early. And I think about now is about the right time. Obviously,
  we lose the uk. Team tomorrow. So if there is anything that we need desperately,
  we can just about get it done tomorrow, but I don''t think there will be. I think
  we''re basically good to go. We''ve got three of 18 now on wishes, so we''ve got
  two more on the on one course and 11 on. The other 11 of 18 on the other. Okay?
  I''ve also got the awareness campaign going and I spoke to Basma in the morning
  and we''re thinking of doing like a separate India campaign as well. Just assign
  a small budget like 50 Durhams a day just for India that way at the moment, like
  we add group them with the Gulf and India. But she''s saying it might be worthwhile
  to separate it. But keep an eye on it though, just, just because I don''t want to
  waste even if it''s 50 Durhams or 10 quid a day. I don''t really want to. Want to
  waste it. And we do have. I think we. If we go through the Google Ads now, we''ve
  probably. We''re probably underspending, really. We''re in low mode at the moment.'
- 'Me: I''ve done a little bit of analysis on the enrollments. You know, I get the.
  I now get the spreadsheet coming from Kelly. So I''ve just broken it down into country
  and region. As to how they''re performing, which hopefully. Will steer us a little
  bit towards the budgets on the individual campaigns. Do you want me to share that
  with you? Okay? This is where it''s up to at the moment in terms of. Enrolments,
  bear in mind. I''ve just realized about five minutes before showing this. I''ve
  not actually put ICE uses a filter paid in full on this. So this enrollments that
  are showing on that spreadsheet, but at least it gives us an indication from a geographic
  perspective as to which particular regions are working and which ones aren''t. So
  this is where the UK is against last year. And this is where the Internationals
  are. So the International has been the purple line. Against the last academic year
  on the blue line. Now the Geographic stuff. So what I''ve done is I''ve taken that
  spreadsheet and I''ve compared it with. The spend for the geographic locations on
  Google Ads. And then created. You''ll see. Further down a percentage, so a cost
  per enrollment. So there is some regions that don''t have a cost per enrollment.
  That''s because we don''t do any Google Ads. Advertising there. But again, this
  just gives us an idea on how efficient the individual geographic locations are.
  So there''s a further breakdown of this. I''m sort of just going to quickly move
  through this. It just gives us an idea as far as international, where what savings.'
- 'Them: Sorry, peter, one question. Is this NDA and nma together or is this just
  NDA?'
- 'Me: And da.'
- 'Them: Okay? Because USA looks quite high and but they do reasonably well with nma
  and it just wouldn''t perhaps if we''ve got NM.'
- 'Me: No, it''s all NDA. This is straight off that. Straight off that spreadsheet.'
- 'Them: Okay? All right. Good to know.'
- 'Me: So 40% in the UAE. This is quite interesting ones. Things like Germany and
  Spain, they''re actually quite strong. Switzerland and so on. So the regional groupings,
  this doesn''t necessarily tie up with the campaigns. That''s going to be the challenge
  when to adopt this is to actually put it to those individual campaigns. So you can
  see here the CPE column span sends to international and enrollments by those individual
  groups. So the uae, well, the Europe is the strongest. It''s the cheapest out of
  all of them. Again. This doesn''t include the uk. This is just international business.
  So 40 enrollments and 101 pound CPE, which is the lowest out of all of them. I think
  if you know, based upon this data, The initial thought is to fish where the fish
  are. Are we actually putting enough money into these? The European. Campaigns don''t
  get a huge amount of money. You know, that''s four grands that it''s got out of
  that total allocation for the budget. He''s broken this down. I''m not familiar
  with the term gcc, but it''s the Gulf countries, isn''t it? So it''s grouped all
  those together.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Again. High cost on that one. Rest of the world does particularly well. But
  obviously there''s a bigger picture there as to exactly what they are. So the detailed
  breakdown. So I''ve now taken these regions and broken them down into the individual
  countries within that region. Germany. 77 pound cost per enrollment again. We don''t
  really focus on that.'
- 'Them: It is. It is a good stat. But if you think about it is so such low numbers.
  It could be one ex student who''s got their own company and has put four of their
  staff on and said, right, you need to do the course. And then it completely kind
  of.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well. And you can view this in a number of different ways, these statistics,
  but they''re the only ones we''ve got.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: If you look. This is why I''ve grouped it together as a region. The region
  itself. Europe does very well. And it does very well in terms of cpe. So whilst
  these are low numbers, it''s showing a certain level of intent. So the Romania one
  here, we don''t do any Google Ads, advertising tools. So this is where it''s come
  through from another source. It might be organic or direct. It''s not immediately
  trackable. So uae, one of them.'
- 'Them: Yeah. We do? Romania. The metads.'
- 'Me: It could be sorry, apologies, and we get it could be from paid media.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Paid social media.'
- 'Them: No, no, I. I understand. I. I only brought it up because I know attribution
  is tricky, and those are always questions I have as well.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So uae. That is what it is. It''s one of them was down in Abu Dhabi.
  So it''s lumped them all together. So rest of the world. Some are strong, some are
  not. These cases in this to actually exclude places like South Africa, which is
  a real outlier. Do we really want to be spending this much money in one country?
  One We''ve only had one enrollment in that period of time, so this is September
  to mid December. GCC.'
- 'Them: Yeah. That''s.'
- 'Me: Bahrain being the most expensive one, Q8 being the cheapest one. And there''s
  the USA and Canada. So we do spend money there, but again, it''s expensive. So 46%
  spending the UK and 53% spend in international. So, relatively speaking, we''re
  just going to do this as a numbers exercise. The UK is underfunded, but you''ve
  got to reach a point where it''s saturation point. The purpose of the exercise here
  is to break it out. Into new markets, into new international markets. So whether
  that''s relevant or not, and we''re going to be costing more money in the rest of
  the world than it is in the UK anyway, because it''s the UK based enterprise. So
  this was the starting point for it, really.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- "Me: This is quite enlightening. Since September we have only had three enrolments\
  \ from India. Do we continue to spend as much as we have when it's costing us \xA3\
  2,700 per enrollment? Are we targeting it incorrectly? I don't know. But."
- 'Them: When. When we''re. When were those three? Because I know Amwish has just
  done a new video and have we put the new video up on Google Ads? The new India video
  on Google Ads. So that''s that. Working with pmax. Okay, and how''s that performing
  now with the new video? Is that. Getting better.'
- 'Me: Yes. Well, there''s been three enrollments since the beginning of September,
  so I''m not too sure when they actually are. I mean, I could break that down even
  further than this. This was just a starting point for doing, like, percentages.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah, I think if. If we''ve had. I must say, I have had recently quite
  a few good calls from India. People who aren''t idiots. They''ve called me up and
  said, you know, ask good questions about the course. So I think it''d be good to
  find out when those enrolments happen. Because if they''ve happened in the last
  couple of weeks, then then I think that''s a positive sign. But I, I don''t necessarily
  think we want to increase the budget in Indian necessarily. Perhaps just leave it
  running as it is. I, I would, I, I''d prefer just, I mean, just from, you know,
  a feel point of view, my natural reaction would be to increase uae, then increase
  Gulf countries. That''s based on the fact that we''ve got these in studio courses
  starting in January. And so there is, you know, we do need to target the local area
  to. To actually get those sold because they''re, you know, after. In February, they''re
  worthless. We can only sell them once. Then, from what you''ve told me, it seems
  like giving Europe as a whole a bit more budget would be a, a good idea. And of
  course, we need to do UK as well, because that''s the bread and butter. And we will
  find that in January, the, the costs will go up. People will start to be. You know,
  there''ll be people. More people bidding in January than they are now.'
- 'Me: Absolutely.'
- 'Them: So best to get in here. Get in there for the tail end of December and get
  a few cheap clicks before. Before January starts. That that would be my gut. But
  I''m happy to be guided as well by any data that we''ve that that gives us. Some.
  Some good ideas.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. Well, the next. The next stage with this. I mean, this. The purpose
  of this is to. Is to present this as. As a breakdown and as a. And as a template
  for the distribution of the budget. The next thing to do is to. Is to weigh this
  up against the actual campaigns themselves. To see what the individual campaigns.
  Because ideally, what I would like to do ultimately is to, is to use these regions.
  To create the campaigns, but I don''t want to start breaking campaigns up now at
  this. At this particular point, I need to be done a bit more gradual.'
- 'Them: Exactly. And also remember that we''ve got a lot of downtime in the summer.
  So I think let''s. Let''s just do what we can now. Get it through till May and then
  in June we can have. We can perhaps start from scratch and say, right, where''s.
  Where''s the low click? Areas? Where''s the high click areas? Let''s group those
  together. Let''s group those together. Let''s simplify everything and give a bit
  more catchment to for pmax to be able to play with.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Well, if. I mean, if you.'
- 'Them: So.'
- 'Me: Have. Sorry. If you''re happy with the principle of this, I can then come up
  with a plan for the actual allocation of the budget. So if you can. If you can let
  me know what the overall budget is going to be for international and for the uk,
  then I can spread that out amongst the campaigns that are actually producing. The
  conversions.'
- 'Them: Go on.'
- 'Me: As a next stage and present that and see what you think about it. And then,
  you know, the nice thing about this is that we''re, you''re applying the business
  knowledge to it and what''s coming on in the, in the, in the, in the coming months.
  That you might say, well, let''s not bother with that one, because it''s like. Like
  you''re saying about the studio. Let''s actually put a bit more money towards that
  because there''s. There''s a new. A new thing that''s coming up, so that''s what
  I would propose. Is to. Is to. The next stage is to do those allocations.'
- 'Them: We. We''ve also got to adjust the elephant. The room as well, which is that
  the previous landing pages were awful, and they''re much, much better now. And so
  we''ve only had, what, two or three weeks of new landing pages and so on. So. So
  we could just organically see a better roi. Anyway, just, just on the back of that,
  with set budget, same tactics, but yeah, let''s, let''s. I think those are good
  things to let''s. Let''s use from now till May as a learning period. We obviously
  need to increase budgets a bit for January, so let''s get that ticked off. And then
  we''ll have a lot more data for. For May. And then I think perhaps let''s revisit
  this conversation as how. How we do it in May, because. Because we''ll probably
  have a better lay of the land. What''s interesting, though, is the graph you sent
  shows the UK is below. Where it was last year. And International is above where
  it was last year. Significantly.'
- 'Me: The Internationals above and UK is above.'
- 'Them: Uk is above.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So I can''t really see that. I can''t. Can you zoom in a little bit? It looks
  to me like the green is this year, is that not correct?'
- 'Me: No, the Greens last year.'
- 'Them: Oh, I see. Right. I was just wondering why the. The blue line is longer.'
- 'Me: Is.'
- 'Them: So well.'
- 'Me: It''s the way in which the data has been held in the. In the spreadsheets.
  A bit weird.'
- 'Them: Okay? Well, I mean. That''s a really, really good stat then, because the.
  If the UK''s historically UK has been sort of 60% of advertising budget, international
  40, then last year it was approximately 50 50, and now it looks like there''s a
  slight lean towards international and it hasn''t affected uk, and that kind of goes
  back to the theory that in the UK we are ranking top three for most of our keywords
  anyway, and so Google will have much less effect there. And like I said to you before,
  sometimes wonder if I should just completely cancel the UK ad budget and just see
  what happens, because if it''s not particularly effective, we''ve doubled our ad
  budget for for International, but I haven''t got. The appetite to take that risk.'
- 'Me: Or kahunas.'
- 'Them: So I think. I think perhaps a gradual, you know, if we. If we keep whatever
  the stat is Now, I think it''s 55, 45, something along those lines, you know, that''s
  probably not a bad ratio.'
- 'Me: So that''s 40, 46% of spend in the UK, so we''re spending more in the international.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay, can I also interject? One little thing from my side on the Gulf
  countries. I you were mentioning, Peter, that''s about Rain''s cost was extremely
  high and the results were quite low. Right. But even like I was chatting with Basma
  as well, like, we do get a lot of interest from Saudi, so it might be beneficial
  to kind of like, tweak that grouping so that Saudi gets more of the budget than
  Bahrain does.'
- 'Me: Y. Eah. And absolutely, that''s the challenge, I suppose, Anweesha, because
  the way in which to run the budgets, you, you would actually like to say, well,
  let''s do like with this one GCC as a campaign and the others as individual ad groups
  and allocate, you know, try and, try and play around with it that way. Which is
  not possible to do. And so in other ways to do it as. As individual campaigns for
  countries. But then they won''t have enough conversions to be able to optimize correctly.
  So we have to. You have to lump it together a little bit.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: And, you know, when you''re looking at Bahrain having, you know, three conversions
  in three. Sorry, one conversion in three months. You almost look at it and go, is
  that really worth it? Should we not be putting the more money into Saudi in Q8?
  And not bothering Bahrain again. That''s a Kahuna''s thing, you know. Do. Do you
  actually say enough is enough? If you need to look over. And the nice thing is there''s
  a lot of data in that spreadsheet, you know, looking at over a longer period of
  time. If we were to see that Bahrain has had one conversion in four years, is it
  actually worth doing? Should it actually more spend be going into the others? But
  again, that''s a. That''s the thing between now and now in May to do. You know,
  are these. Are these. Are we actually chasing countries where it''s. That it''s
  not actually worth chasing?'
- 'Them: It might be worthwhile to have a Saudi campaign as well. That''s just separate
  from the GCC ones, because even over. Even out here, like, whenever, like, I''m
  running creatives, that. That''s. That''s got, like, an Arabic woman woman on it.
  Like, that''s one. Those are the ones that are, like, getting the maximum number
  of attention. Yeah, exactly. I think let''s, let''s keep it and let''s, let''s focus
  our time in the next four or five months on adapting copy to suit that place. And
  if we''ve got a video that has Arabic woman in it, that''s that goes there. Maybe
  we get higher ROI on it. Just with copy chasing. So I think let''s, let''s use this
  next five months to tweak all the other, all the other variables. And then in May,
  we''ve got a pretty good idea what works, what doesn''t work, and then we can completely
  revisit the targeting plan, the budgetary plan.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: And one more thing from my side. Sorry, Peter. So we did a studio shoot a
  couple weeks back out here, and we have, like, videos in square, vertical, horizontal.
  So those are the kind of creatives you feel that might be beneficial for Google
  Ads. I''m happy to send those over to you.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, anything like that.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Yeah, superb. I think, on your. On your point, though, Paul.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The one thing that Google''s not going to like with this is hypnotized by the
  rain.'
- 'Them: I mean, it''s absolutely.'
- 'Me: Is it?'
- 'Them: Bucketing down. Yeah, look. Look at that.'
- 'Me: Wow.'
- 'Them: That''s in, what, five minutes?'
- 'Me: Gosh.'
- 'Them: I still haven''t had rain. Out here. No, no, no. The same country. I think
  you''re live. I just wanted. Just to make sure that the window is closed upstairs.
  Just give me a sec.'
- 'Me: I can look out the window any day, aren''t we? It''s actually stopped raining
  now. It''s wet out there, but it''s stopped.'
- 'Them: Well, it''s not trading here at. We''re in the same city. No.'
- 'Me: I was in.'
- 'Them: Not yet.'
- 'Me: Good old climate change. Of course, it doesn''t exist. Climate change. Does
  it?'
- 'Them: My God. Like, you should hear the latest news come that that comes out of
  India. It''s so terrifying. Especially like Delhi, that, like the capital of the
  country, it''s invisible because we have smog like that. The level of pollution
  there, it''s. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Really?'
- 'Them: It''s hard to even imagine.'
- 'Me: Which is? People are ignoring this thing, aren''t they? It''s crazy.'
- 'Them: They''re, they''re living in it. And the amount of the. How obscene the property
  prices are out there and what they''re breathing and what they''re drinking, like
  the water, it''s like, I don''t know how these ultra rich people are living this.
  Way.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah. I was. I was talking to a Google rep in Mumbai one day. And he
  said, I talked to the Google reps because you find them interesting. I''m not bothered
  about the Google Ad stuff because they just took the same stuff all the time anyway.
  And this. This guy said. He said, yeah, it''s quite. It''s quite warm here at the
  moment. I said. He said, it''s so hot, usually I come to work on my bicycle. He
  said, I can''t ride my bicycle today.'
- 'Them: Yeah, absolutely, I''ll do that. For. What''s the next.'
- 'Me: I said, how hot is. He said, It''s 50 degrees. That''s.'
- 'Them: One. Was. Bad. When was it? 50. When was this?'
- 'Me: Sorry.'
- 'Them: This would be a while back because I was in India recently and it wasn''t
  50 degrees.'
- 'Me: It was. Yeah, it took. It was two or three years ago. When I was speaking to
  him.'
- 'Them: Okay? I mean. You got to imagine it''s 50 with the plus humidity. We get
  50 out here, but we don''t get that kind of humidity.'
- 'Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, is it over 50? It''s unsustainable for human life
  or something. It''s, you know, gets to a certain point.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: And it. And you could argue that, you know, if, if you lived in Sweden, you
  could. If it''s like mine is 20 or something, that''s unsustainable for human life,
  so people just stay indoors. It''s the same now with the, the, the temper, the high
  temperatures, isn''t it, that you. Stay indoors and put the aircon on. In the same
  way as you would do a heater.'
- 'Them: Also. Also bear in mind that when it says it''s 49, 50, that''s in the shade,
  it''s not in the sun. When it''s in, in the sun is much, much higher.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Them: We. We played a golf round a few years ago and it was. They''ve got a Mercury
  on. On the first hole and it was 63. On the mercury.'
- 'Me: 63.'
- 'Them: We''ve all got to move. Living in cities is no longer an option.'
- 'Me: I''ll be in the bar, mate. I wouldn''t be on the course.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, we only played four holes of that round and. And then we had
  a sandstorm, so we had to come in. Anyway, it was quite a brutal day.'
- 'Me: God. Yeah, I was going to say with your point about doing this in in May time.
  We''ve got to be careful not to do things sort of like all in one go, just a big
  bang approach. I want to be able. I want to be wriggling around a little bit now,
  moving, moving stuff around. Not in January, because that is, that is the busy time,
  but doing, doing some small changes to structure. Prior to that so it can settle
  in.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: And so I don''t. I don''t want to do anything too dramatic either, but it needs.
  It needs some sort of thought on restructure. I''ll pass it by you before I do anything.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we''ll talk about it.'
- 'Me: But just some thoughts. On it.'
- 'Them: We''ll talk about it at the end of January, can''t we? Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: All right, so should we. Should we lock in on the budget and see what we
  can tweak and where we should go?'
- 'Me: Well, can I. Can I. Do you want me to get together some ideas on. On budget?'
- 'Them: I think let''s just have a look at what we''re spending because there might
  be some obvious things that need to change. I know that we changed a lot. Recently.'
- 'Me: Because that seemed to work well, didn''t it? Over over december. You know,
  using that, use that data, data driven approach to.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: Allocate the. The reductions in the budget. Seems to have worked well.'
- 'Them: Can you zoom in slightly?'
- 'Me: How''s that?'
- 'Them: Yeah, that''s better. Yeah. So if we list it in terms of budgets, so what
  our highest first, I don''t think we need to change the uk. And that''s probably
  not spending all it is still limited by budget. That''s a Google problem. I don''t
  think that. I think. Yeah, so? So that. That''s plenty. What did it spend yesterday?'
- 'Me: Pretty much the budget. 285.'
- 'Them: 285. Yeah. Okay, look, that''s the highest we''ve ever run it at, and I think
  let''s. Let''s just leave it there because it''s pretty significant. So NDA interior
  design, uae. Now that''s removed.'
- 'Me: Nothing.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Wrong.'
- 'Them: So NDA uk brand. New custom no target.'
- 'Me: Look at that. That shows the drop in demand.'
- 'Them: What? Did. Yeah. What? Did what? Did uae spend yesterday?'
- 'Me: 2:31.'
- 'Them: No, I mean. Cost 15 1. So it''s. But I see. So. So the search campaign spent
  151 of the 90.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: So I think that''s something we can increase. So if we can put that at, say,
  120.'
- 'Me: It''s not limited by budget.'
- 'Them: It did spend 150 yesterday.'
- "Me: So the budget is \xA390 over 30 days. Decided there was a bit of a something\
  \ to go after yesterday, so up the budget."
- 'Them: Yeah. So let. Let''s stick that onto 120. Because in theory, it will be.
  If it''s. It will be taking money off other days. So degree isn''t spending. Yet,
  so I don''t know.'
- 'Me: This is dangerous being it over one day.'
- 'Them: It is, but it''s better information. I mean, we can look at. Well, to be
  fair, yesterday is a good day. It''s a midweek. It''s. It''s. It''s better than
  a weekend.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s just. It''s just dangerous to base a spend on the whole of January
  on one day, though. About what this ban was.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I mean. So the alternative would be.'
- 'Me: Well, if we. If we look at. We, if we look at it over if we look at it over
  14 days. And then do. Predicted and not predicted one percentage of daily of daily
  budget spent here. This then tells us how much of it is, whether it''s up to its
  limits or not at this particular point in time. So things like the like we wouldn''t
  necessarily do. There''s a landscape Design is spending 100 of its 106 of his budget,
  so it is up to its limit, whereas the interior design diploma is only spending 77
  of its budget.'
- 'Them: Okay? Yeah. Y.'
- 'Me: So it doesn''t have the potential to grow yet.'
- 'Them: Eah. Okay?'
- 'Me: But what we''re looking at is moving into a time where there''s going to be
  higher demand in January.'
- 'Them: Where it will.'
- 'Me: So it''s trying to second guess that what that''s going to be, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Okay, so let''s stick. So degrees obviously need to go
  up a bit. They''re 50, I think. Let''s put those up to 60. It''d be helpful to have
  that column so we can see it.'
- 'Me: It. Would. Hope. You come.'
- 'Them: Then the P max, that''s only 20 a day, so I think that can be 40. Landscape.
  Yeah, let''s put that up to 15, at least. What? What''s the difference between the.
  Pmax at 24 4. And 28 5. So the bot.'
- 'Me: They''re just dates. Once a diploma wants a degree.'
- 'Them: Oh, I see. Yeah.'
- 'Me: These are just my notes at the end.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Got it, got it. Okay. All right. I. I think that that''s probably okay
  for the uae. Next stage, let''s look at gcc.'
- 'Me: Right. That''s a good point. Actually, what I''ll do. After the meeting today
  is actually. Actually mark these as gcc. That''s if that''s the terminology we''re
  going to use for those particular countries. They''re a little bit all over the
  show. These because we''ve got. We''ve got things like this one here. This is why
  I want to try and consolidate it all together. Because to do this kind of exercise
  with those regions is nigh on impossible.'
- 'Them: Are we missing Qatar on there? Because Qatar would probably be a good. Are
  we missing Syria? On that. That tells you a good one.'
- 'Me: Syria. Okay, I''m not saying Syria anywhere in the enrollment stats at all.'
- 'Them: You think that''s good one and. There''s a lot of Syrians out here as well.
  They''re quite design oriented. Okay? I''d be good to experiment at least. Terms
  of audience.'
- 'Me: Yeah, it''s just those four.'
- 'Them: Okay, so we need to include Qatar and Syria.'
- 'Me: Qatar will be somewhere else.'
- 'Them: And then give it a bit more. All right.'
- 'Me: It''s doing this in a. In a. In. In this sort of last minute kind of way. Makes
  me uncomfortable that we''re not actually covering all this because I don''t know
  what. Where. Where you''re going to be wanting to put all these budget changes.
  Based upon what I''ve got in here, because they are dotted around. This is. This
  is why. You know, thinking about doing this going to go into May, when we start
  to look at these individual regions makes me uncomfortable because we''re at peak
  time now in January. We''ve absolutely got to get this right, that we''re actually
  aiming the money at the right sort of places, but with the current structure the
  way it is. I''m going to find it very difficult to. To fulfill your wishes, to actually
  put it towards the right countries. Because they are dotted around.'
- 'Them: Well, we can, we can put Qatar in there because Qatar is.'
- 'Me: Yeah, but it''s probably covered somewhere else. It''s not as though Qatar
  is not actually covered, it''s just not in that particular campaign.'
- 'Them: But qatar is is a gcc country.'
- 'Me: Yes. Yes, it is. But that''s not a piece. Yeah, but that''s not a GCC campaign
  yet.'
- 'Them: And so we''re to not have it in that one.'
- 'Me: Those regions that I''m. I''m describing to you. Are what I found from the
  enrollments. They''re not reflective of what the Google Ad structure is at the moment.
  Is what I would like it to be so we can get more tight with it.'
- 'Them: Okay, sure. So what? What do you suggest?'
- 'Me: Well, I''d like. I''d like to. I''d like to. I''d like to revisit this. I''d
  like to. I''d like to be able to. I can''t even do that. I''d like to be able to
  do. Some organization of this, even if he''s just a naming organization. So we can
  actually understand the way in which that the, the, the regions in that report are
  actually reflected in the campaigns that are on the, on the, the website. So if
  you are actually tweaking it, we know which countries we''re actually doing. It
  towards. You know, that enrollment data for me is fairly. Is fairly new. We''ve
  been able to analyze it recently.'
- 'Them: Okay? Should we?'
- 'Me: But it''s never been used before. In this. In this particular way. So even
  if it''s just like, give me a couple of days just to get this into a naming convention
  that makes sense,'
- 'Them: Okay, well, she would just save. Qatar is being covered. Because if it''s
  not being covered, it''s. It''d be quite easy just to add it in.'
- 'Me: I''m just trying to find. It. Don''t. Know why I can''t search on that.'
- 'Them: The rain stopped.'
- 'Me: Yeah, catal''s in. There.'
- 'Them: Okay, which campaign is that under?'
- 'Me: So it''s bahrain. Cy being. Cyprus.'
- 'Them: Okay, but Kuwait being covered in there.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: But it''s also covered in the other one.'
- 'Me: Yep. Yep.'
- 'Them: So they''ll be competing, will they?'
- 'Me: The other one was a pmax campaign. I think this is a search campaign. This
  is what I mean. It''s all over. It''s all over the show. It needs consolidating.
  We''ve got Singapore in there as well. You. We''ve discussed it before about whether
  to have. Because of those regions. I think you. You mooted it in the first place.
  Is to say is to do it more as a time zone kind of thing. Because with the individual
  time zones, we''re looking at individual cultures as well, which will match better
  with potentially with the text that we''re going to be using in the, in the ads.
  And that would be a better way to do it, rather than what''s happened before, is
  that this has been targeted towards intent. So it was the. It was the best performing
  ones grouped together and the middle and then the. And the. Then the lower ones
  and that suddenly just spread the whole thing out and gave it no sort of logical
  grouping at all. Because that''s why we got Singapore and Cyprus in the. In the.
  The same things here. So it''s just doing that, that consolidation.'
- 'Them: We''ll Qatar seems to be performing reasonably well. 29 clicks. For $29.
  29.'
- 'Me: Yeah. And if you look at this, Let''s see if I. One conversion in that. In
  that period of time, which is probably not bad considering that level of spend.'
- 'Them: One. Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: But is that. Is that relationship between the two of them we need to. We need
  to fully understand.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Okay, so should we just go through the budgets, then? And then? And
  then you want to have a little play with it and reword it?'
- 'Me: Okay? Yeah.'
- 'Them: Find that there. So, so the next one, let''s have. If we just look at all
  the campaigns and if we can keep that percentage, we can. We should see straight
  away. So the Oman, Syria, the search campaign there is 102. So I think it''s the
  fifth or sixth one down. $50 a day. I think we put that up to 60. So, interior design
  degree, uk. That can go up to 60. Remarketing UK looks like it''s under spending
  that can go up to 50. Rest of the world diploma. Let''s put that up to 50. Psalm30.
  So it''s just the one. It''s the one above, limited by budget. That''s the one.
  So put that up to 50. Austria, france, holland, malta. That''s the degree. So put
  that up to 20. So it''s a few down.'
- 'Me: See, that''s the one that''s smashing it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So let''s put that up to 20. Sorry, let''s first say 25. And what.
  What are other European ones?'
- 'Me: That one there. That was that was Paul Wright back in the last. In the last
  change.'
- 'Them: Actually, let''s put that up to 20 then, because that seems like that was
  a good performer, wasn''t it?'
- 'Me: Y. Eah.'
- 'Them: Okay? I think that''s probably got the meat out the sandwich there. And just
  off the top, like, off the top of my head, I think we''ve added something like a
  hundred pounds to the budget, which is like, about. About 10%, so I think that''s
  not a bad start.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Them: And then. And then we can revisit it. You know, either end of December or
  early Jan. And then if you, if you''ve got some ideas in the next couple of days
  of how you want to restructure it, just let me know and I can jump in the call with
  you.'
- 'Me: Yeah, I''m gonna. I''m gonna start off by just putting those regions in. If
  we use those as a starting point. Just in the campaign name. So if you say to me,
  what, which one''s a European ones, at least we can actually see which of the European
  which are the GC3s and then whether there''s. Yeah. I''m. I''m not going to change
  huge amounts of. Of reorganization. I''m on the first blinders guy at Sami window
  scares the life out of me every time. They wouldn''t have cleaner comes. I''m not
  going to move things around dramatically at this stage, but I will as far as the
  naming conventions are concerned. I think that would be a good starting point.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: Sounds good. All right. Thank you.'
- 'Me: The. The pmax text assets. Those. Those ones are sent over you okay for me
  to implement those.'
- 'Them: I haven''t had a chance to take a look at it. Do you mind just holding it
  off until today? I''ll take a look today.'
- 'Me: Okay? Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Lovely.'
- 'Them: Sure.'
- 'Me: These guys. Bye. Bye now.'
- 'Them: Okay. All right.'

- Them: Peter.
- Me: Sorry. I just get my video on. All this playing funny Packers. You see me okay?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Can't see you. Right. Why is that? There we go. Bright and breezy this morning.
- Them: Very good. Do I?
- Me: Yeah. It's usually because I'm speaking about midnight or something.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: I wish.
- Them: Hi. Hi. How are you?
- Me: Good. Thank you. Ready for Christmas. Let's get this thing out the way with.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I was talking to someone the other day who's in Saudi, said it was quite amazing how little. Well, there is nothing, absolutely nothing. You go down our road at the moment, there's just lights everywhere. He said there's not an inkling of it anywhere. Not even from the expat community. Is it about the same there?
- Them: No, no, it's. Christmas is everywhere here.
- Me: Oh, is it?
- Them: You can't. You can't miss it. It's. There's a radio show, 92 Dubai. 92. I listened to most of the time, and it's all Christmas songs now.
- Me: Really?
- Them: All the malls are all Christmas and yeah.
- Me: Nice. Oh, very nice.
- Them: When I was in Canada, it used to be a nightmare to shop. Actually, every time you're in a mall it's Christmas songs. But in Dubai, I always gift it. Firstly, I don't go to shopping malls. So that's the relevant of my life. That's done.
- Me: That's a good idea.
- Them: With.
- Me: The more people like Joan, we should buy online. Thank you.
- Them: It's like. Buy online. Yeah, just. Just leave all of it out of the way. Listen to your own music. You're good.
- Me: Lovely. Or we're going to go way between Christmas and New Year. Get away from the madness. As usual. In the middle of Kilda Forest, just miles from anywhere. Very nice. Yes, I am a grinch.
- Them: Yes, now it sounds good to me. Sounds good to me. I keep having. Oh, it's raining. There's water falling from the sky.
- Me: Really?
- Them: I'm we sure? What's going on? I haven't seen that for months. The water hasn't fall from the sky out here, so it's very specific. To you. It's probably coming your way. I'm Jamera partway, so. All right. It's coming to you. It's coming to you. Yeah. Started on the front of the house and it's coming to the back or the other way around. From a tropical country. It's very strange when I don't see rainfall all the. It's not okay. I'm. I'm from a reigning country. It just rains and it's very. It's very odd.
- Me: Yep. Straight ahead.
- Them: It's odd when there's no rain.
- Me: It's really wet here at the moment. There's been some nasty flooding up in the Lake District. So, yeah, it's not great.
- Them: We've actually got gills. So the. The Brits. It rains so much, we've actually developed gills over time.
- Me: I can imagine there people are running out in the street going, oh.
- Them: I think people here have gotten really terrified of rain. So ever since that happened, I believe it was last year or the year before that. And like, are there all the purchase at the Bentleys kind of just went underwater because the city is not equipped for rain.
- Me: W. Ow.
- Them: So anytime there's even a little bit, it's like we get alerts, like nationwide alerts to everyone's cell phones. There. There might be rain. And I'm just like, it's just a little rain.
- Me: Really? We get alerts when it's not raining today. Nice one.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Cool.
- Them: So I thought. I thought I'd save this meeting for the last one pretty much of the year, because we want to have a. Have a tweet with the budgets, but I don't want to tweak them too early. And I think about now is about the right time. Obviously, we lose the uk. Team tomorrow. So if there is anything that we need desperately, we can just about get it done tomorrow, but I don't think there will be. I think we're basically good to go. We've got three of 18 now on wishes, so we've got two more on the on one course and 11 on. The other 11 of 18 on the other. Okay? I've also got the awareness campaign going and I spoke to Basma in the morning and we're thinking of doing like a separate India campaign as well. Just assign a small budget like 50 Durhams a day just for India that way at the moment, like we add group them with the Gulf and India. But she's saying it might be worthwhile to separate it. But keep an eye on it though, just, just because I don't want to waste even if it's 50 Durhams or 10 quid a day. I don't really want to. Want to waste it. And we do have. I think we. If we go through the Google Ads now, we've probably. We're probably underspending, really. We're in low mode at the moment.
- Me: I've done a little bit of analysis on the enrollments. You know, I get the. I now get the spreadsheet coming from Kelly. So I've just broken it down into country and region. As to how they're performing, which hopefully. Will steer us a little bit towards the budgets on the individual campaigns. Do you want me to share that with you? Okay? This is where it's up to at the moment in terms of. Enrolments, bear in mind. I've just realized about five minutes before showing this. I've not actually put ICE uses a filter paid in full on this. So this enrollments that are showing on that spreadsheet, but at least it gives us an indication from a geographic perspective as to which particular regions are working and which ones aren't. So this is where the UK is against last year. And this is where the Internationals are. So the International has been the purple line. Against the last academic year on the blue line. Now the Geographic stuff. So what I've done is I've taken that spreadsheet and I've compared it with. The spend for the geographic locations on Google Ads. And then created. You'll see. Further down a percentage, so a cost per enrollment. So there is some regions that don't have a cost per enrollment. That's because we don't do any Google Ads. Advertising there. But again, this just gives us an idea on how efficient the individual geographic locations are. So there's a further breakdown of this. I'm sort of just going to quickly move through this. It just gives us an idea as far as international, where what savings.
- Them: Sorry, peter, one question. Is this NDA and nma together or is this just NDA?
- Me: And da.
- Them: Okay? Because USA looks quite high and but they do reasonably well with nma and it just wouldn't perhaps if we've got NM.
- Me: No, it's all NDA. This is straight off that. Straight off that spreadsheet.
- Them: Okay? All right. Good to know.
- Me: So 40% in the UAE. This is quite interesting ones. Things like Germany and Spain, they're actually quite strong. Switzerland and so on. So the regional groupings, this doesn't necessarily tie up with the campaigns. That's going to be the challenge when to adopt this is to actually put it to those individual campaigns. So you can see here the CPE column span sends to international and enrollments by those individual groups. So the uae, well, the Europe is the strongest. It's the cheapest out of all of them. Again. This doesn't include the uk. This is just international business. So 40 enrollments and 101 pound CPE, which is the lowest out of all of them. I think if you know, based upon this data, The initial thought is to fish where the fish are. Are we actually putting enough money into these? The European. Campaigns don't get a huge amount of money. You know, that's four grands that it's got out of that total allocation for the budget. He's broken this down. I'm not familiar with the term gcc, but it's the Gulf countries, isn't it? So it's grouped all those together.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Again. High cost on that one. Rest of the world does particularly well. But obviously there's a bigger picture there as to exactly what they are. So the detailed breakdown. So I've now taken these regions and broken them down into the individual countries within that region. Germany. 77 pound cost per enrollment again. We don't really focus on that.
- Them: It is. It is a good stat. But if you think about it is so such low numbers. It could be one ex student who's got their own company and has put four of their staff on and said, right, you need to do the course. And then it completely kind of.
- Me: Yeah. Well. And you can view this in a number of different ways, these statistics, but they're the only ones we've got.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: If you look. This is why I've grouped it together as a region. The region itself. Europe does very well. And it does very well in terms of cpe. So whilst these are low numbers, it's showing a certain level of intent. So the Romania one here, we don't do any Google Ads, advertising tools. So this is where it's come through from another source. It might be organic or direct. It's not immediately trackable. So uae, one of them.
- Them: Yeah. We do? Romania. The metads.
- Me: It could be sorry, apologies, and we get it could be from paid media.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Paid social media.
- Them: No, no, I. I understand. I. I only brought it up because I know attribution is tricky, and those are always questions I have as well.
- Me: Yeah. So uae. That is what it is. It's one of them was down in Abu Dhabi. So it's lumped them all together. So rest of the world. Some are strong, some are not. These cases in this to actually exclude places like South Africa, which is a real outlier. Do we really want to be spending this much money in one country? One We've only had one enrollment in that period of time, so this is September to mid December. GCC.
- Them: Yeah. That's.
- Me: Bahrain being the most expensive one, Q8 being the cheapest one. And there's the USA and Canada. So we do spend money there, but again, it's expensive. So 46% spending the UK and 53% spend in international. So, relatively speaking, we're just going to do this as a numbers exercise. The UK is underfunded, but you've got to reach a point where it's saturation point. The purpose of the exercise here is to break it out. Into new markets, into new international markets. So whether that's relevant or not, and we're going to be costing more money in the rest of the world than it is in the UK anyway, because it's the UK based enterprise. So this was the starting point for it, really.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: This is quite enlightening. Since September we have only had three enrolments from India. Do we continue to spend as much as we have when it's costing us £2,700 per enrollment? Are we targeting it incorrectly? I don't know. But.
- Them: When. When we're. When were those three? Because I know Amwish has just done a new video and have we put the new video up on Google Ads? The new India video on Google Ads. So that's that. Working with pmax. Okay, and how's that performing now with the new video? Is that. Getting better.
- Me: Yes. Well, there's been three enrollments since the beginning of September, so I'm not too sure when they actually are. I mean, I could break that down even further than this. This was just a starting point for doing, like, percentages.
- Them: Okay? Yeah, I think if. If we've had. I must say, I have had recently quite a few good calls from India. People who aren't idiots. They've called me up and said, you know, ask good questions about the course. So I think it'd be good to find out when those enrolments happen. Because if they've happened in the last couple of weeks, then then I think that's a positive sign. But I, I don't necessarily think we want to increase the budget in Indian necessarily. Perhaps just leave it running as it is. I, I would, I, I'd prefer just, I mean, just from, you know, a feel point of view, my natural reaction would be to increase uae, then increase Gulf countries. That's based on the fact that we've got these in studio courses starting in January. And so there is, you know, we do need to target the local area to. To actually get those sold because they're, you know, after. In February, they're worthless. We can only sell them once. Then, from what you've told me, it seems like giving Europe as a whole a bit more budget would be a, a good idea. And of course, we need to do UK as well, because that's the bread and butter. And we will find that in January, the, the costs will go up. People will start to be. You know, there'll be people. More people bidding in January than they are now.
- Me: Absolutely.
- Them: So best to get in here. Get in there for the tail end of December and get a few cheap clicks before. Before January starts. That that would be my gut. But I'm happy to be guided as well by any data that we've that that gives us. Some. Some good ideas.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. Well, the next. The next stage with this. I mean, this. The purpose of this is to. Is to present this as. As a breakdown and as a. And as a template for the distribution of the budget. The next thing to do is to. Is to weigh this up against the actual campaigns themselves. To see what the individual campaigns. Because ideally, what I would like to do ultimately is to, is to use these regions. To create the campaigns, but I don't want to start breaking campaigns up now at this. At this particular point, I need to be done a bit more gradual.
- Them: Exactly. And also remember that we've got a lot of downtime in the summer. So I think let's. Let's just do what we can now. Get it through till May and then in June we can have. We can perhaps start from scratch and say, right, where's. Where's the low click? Areas? Where's the high click areas? Let's group those together. Let's group those together. Let's simplify everything and give a bit more catchment to for pmax to be able to play with.
- Me: Yeah. Well, if. I mean, if you.
- Them: So.
- Me: Have. Sorry. If you're happy with the principle of this, I can then come up with a plan for the actual allocation of the budget. So if you can. If you can let me know what the overall budget is going to be for international and for the uk, then I can spread that out amongst the campaigns that are actually producing. The conversions.
- Them: Go on.
- Me: As a next stage and present that and see what you think about it. And then, you know, the nice thing about this is that we're, you're applying the business knowledge to it and what's coming on in the, in the, in the, in the coming months. That you might say, well, let's not bother with that one, because it's like. Like you're saying about the studio. Let's actually put a bit more money towards that because there's. There's a new. A new thing that's coming up, so that's what I would propose. Is to. Is to. The next stage is to do those allocations.
- Them: We. We've also got to adjust the elephant. The room as well, which is that the previous landing pages were awful, and they're much, much better now. And so we've only had, what, two or three weeks of new landing pages and so on. So. So we could just organically see a better roi. Anyway, just, just on the back of that, with set budget, same tactics, but yeah, let's, let's. I think those are good things to let's. Let's use from now till May as a learning period. We obviously need to increase budgets a bit for January, so let's get that ticked off. And then we'll have a lot more data for. For May. And then I think perhaps let's revisit this conversation as how. How we do it in May, because. Because we'll probably have a better lay of the land. What's interesting, though, is the graph you sent shows the UK is below. Where it was last year. And International is above where it was last year. Significantly.
- Me: The Internationals above and UK is above.
- Them: Uk is above.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So I can't really see that. I can't. Can you zoom in a little bit? It looks to me like the green is this year, is that not correct?
- Me: No, the Greens last year.
- Them: Oh, I see. Right. I was just wondering why the. The blue line is longer.
- Me: Is.
- Them: So well.
- Me: It's the way in which the data has been held in the. In the spreadsheets. A bit weird.
- Them: Okay? Well, I mean. That's a really, really good stat then, because the. If the UK's historically UK has been sort of 60% of advertising budget, international 40, then last year it was approximately 50 50, and now it looks like there's a slight lean towards international and it hasn't affected uk, and that kind of goes back to the theory that in the UK we are ranking top three for most of our keywords anyway, and so Google will have much less effect there. And like I said to you before, sometimes wonder if I should just completely cancel the UK ad budget and just see what happens, because if it's not particularly effective, we've doubled our ad budget for for International, but I haven't got. The appetite to take that risk.
- Me: Or kahunas.
- Them: So I think. I think perhaps a gradual, you know, if we. If we keep whatever the stat is Now, I think it's 55, 45, something along those lines, you know, that's probably not a bad ratio.
- Me: So that's 40, 46% of spend in the UK, so we're spending more in the international.
- Them: Yeah. Okay, can I also interject? One little thing from my side on the Gulf countries. I you were mentioning, Peter, that's about Rain's cost was extremely high and the results were quite low. Right. But even like I was chatting with Basma as well, like, we do get a lot of interest from Saudi, so it might be beneficial to kind of like, tweak that grouping so that Saudi gets more of the budget than Bahrain does.
- Me: Y. Eah. And absolutely, that's the challenge, I suppose, Anweesha, because the way in which to run the budgets, you, you would actually like to say, well, let's do like with this one GCC as a campaign and the others as individual ad groups and allocate, you know, try and, try and play around with it that way. Which is not possible to do. And so in other ways to do it as. As individual campaigns for countries. But then they won't have enough conversions to be able to optimize correctly. So we have to. You have to lump it together a little bit.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: And, you know, when you're looking at Bahrain having, you know, three conversions in three. Sorry, one conversion in three months. You almost look at it and go, is that really worth it? Should we not be putting the more money into Saudi in Q8? And not bothering Bahrain again. That's a Kahuna's thing, you know. Do. Do you actually say enough is enough? If you need to look over. And the nice thing is there's a lot of data in that spreadsheet, you know, looking at over a longer period of time. If we were to see that Bahrain has had one conversion in four years, is it actually worth doing? Should it actually more spend be going into the others? But again, that's a. That's the thing between now and now in May to do. You know, are these. Are these. Are we actually chasing countries where it's. That it's not actually worth chasing?
- Them: It might be worthwhile to have a Saudi campaign as well. That's just separate from the GCC ones, because even over. Even out here, like, whenever, like, I'm running creatives, that. That's. That's got, like, an Arabic woman woman on it. Like, that's one. Those are the ones that are, like, getting the maximum number of attention. Yeah, exactly. I think let's, let's keep it and let's, let's focus our time in the next four or five months on adapting copy to suit that place. And if we've got a video that has Arabic woman in it, that's that goes there. Maybe we get higher ROI on it. Just with copy chasing. So I think let's, let's use this next five months to tweak all the other, all the other variables. And then in May, we've got a pretty good idea what works, what doesn't work, and then we can completely revisit the targeting plan, the budgetary plan.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: And one more thing from my side. Sorry, Peter. So we did a studio shoot a couple weeks back out here, and we have, like, videos in square, vertical, horizontal. So those are the kind of creatives you feel that might be beneficial for Google Ads. I'm happy to send those over to you.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, anything like that.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Yeah, superb. I think, on your. On your point, though, Paul.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The one thing that Google's not going to like with this is hypnotized by the rain.
- Them: I mean, it's absolutely.
- Me: Is it?
- Them: Bucketing down. Yeah, look. Look at that.
- Me: Wow.
- Them: That's in, what, five minutes?
- Me: Gosh.
- Them: I still haven't had rain. Out here. No, no, no. The same country. I think you're live. I just wanted. Just to make sure that the window is closed upstairs. Just give me a sec.
- Me: I can look out the window any day, aren't we? It's actually stopped raining now. It's wet out there, but it's stopped.
- Them: Well, it's not trading here at. We're in the same city. No.
- Me: I was in.
- Them: Not yet.
- Me: Good old climate change. Of course, it doesn't exist. Climate change. Does it?
- Them: My God. Like, you should hear the latest news come that that comes out of India. It's so terrifying. Especially like Delhi, that, like the capital of the country, it's invisible because we have smog like that. The level of pollution there, it's. Yeah.
- Me: Really?
- Them: It's hard to even imagine.
- Me: Which is? People are ignoring this thing, aren't they? It's crazy.
- Them: They're, they're living in it. And the amount of the. How obscene the property prices are out there and what they're breathing and what they're drinking, like the water, it's like, I don't know how these ultra rich people are living this. Way.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah. I was. I was talking to a Google rep in Mumbai one day. And he said, I talked to the Google reps because you find them interesting. I'm not bothered about the Google Ad stuff because they just took the same stuff all the time anyway. And this. This guy said. He said, yeah, it's quite. It's quite warm here at the moment. I said. He said, it's so hot, usually I come to work on my bicycle. He said, I can't ride my bicycle today.
- Them: Yeah, absolutely, I'll do that. For. What's the next.
- Me: I said, how hot is. He said, It's 50 degrees. That's.
- Them: One. Was. Bad. When was it? 50. When was this?
- Me: Sorry.
- Them: This would be a while back because I was in India recently and it wasn't 50 degrees.
- Me: It was. Yeah, it took. It was two or three years ago. When I was speaking to him.
- Them: Okay? I mean. You got to imagine it's 50 with the plus humidity. We get 50 out here, but we don't get that kind of humidity.
- Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, is it over 50? It's unsustainable for human life or something. It's, you know, gets to a certain point.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: And it. And you could argue that, you know, if, if you lived in Sweden, you could. If it's like mine is 20 or something, that's unsustainable for human life, so people just stay indoors. It's the same now with the, the, the temper, the high temperatures, isn't it, that you. Stay indoors and put the aircon on. In the same way as you would do a heater.
- Them: Also. Also bear in mind that when it says it's 49, 50, that's in the shade, it's not in the sun. When it's in, in the sun is much, much higher.
- Me: Yeah. Yeah.
- Them: We. We played a golf round a few years ago and it was. They've got a Mercury on. On the first hole and it was 63. On the mercury.
- Me: 63.
- Them: We've all got to move. Living in cities is no longer an option.
- Me: I'll be in the bar, mate. I wouldn't be on the course.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, we only played four holes of that round and. And then we had a sandstorm, so we had to come in. Anyway, it was quite a brutal day.
- Me: God. Yeah, I was going to say with your point about doing this in in May time. We've got to be careful not to do things sort of like all in one go, just a big bang approach. I want to be able. I want to be wriggling around a little bit now, moving, moving stuff around. Not in January, because that is, that is the busy time, but doing, doing some small changes to structure. Prior to that so it can settle in.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: And so I don't. I don't want to do anything too dramatic either, but it needs. It needs some sort of thought on restructure. I'll pass it by you before I do anything.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we'll talk about it.
- Me: But just some thoughts. On it.
- Them: We'll talk about it at the end of January, can't we? Yeah.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: All right, so should we. Should we lock in on the budget and see what we can tweak and where we should go?
- Me: Well, can I. Can I. Do you want me to get together some ideas on. On budget?
- Them: I think let's just have a look at what we're spending because there might be some obvious things that need to change. I know that we changed a lot. Recently.
- Me: Because that seemed to work well, didn't it? Over over december. You know, using that, use that data, data driven approach to.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: Allocate the. The reductions in the budget. Seems to have worked well.
- Them: Can you zoom in slightly?
- Me: How's that?
- Them: Yeah, that's better. Yeah. So if we list it in terms of budgets, so what our highest first, I don't think we need to change the uk. And that's probably not spending all it is still limited by budget. That's a Google problem. I don't think that. I think. Yeah, so? So that. That's plenty. What did it spend yesterday?
- Me: Pretty much the budget. 285.
- Them: 285. Yeah. Okay, look, that's the highest we've ever run it at, and I think let's. Let's just leave it there because it's pretty significant. So NDA interior design, uae. Now that's removed.
- Me: Nothing.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Wrong.
- Them: So NDA uk brand. New custom no target.
- Me: Look at that. That shows the drop in demand.
- Them: What? Did. Yeah. What? Did what? Did uae spend yesterday?
- Me: 2:31.
- Them: No, I mean. Cost 15 1. So it's. But I see. So. So the search campaign spent 151 of the 90.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: So I think that's something we can increase. So if we can put that at, say, 120.
- Me: It's not limited by budget.
- Them: It did spend 150 yesterday.
- Me: So the budget is £90 over 30 days. Decided there was a bit of a something to go after yesterday, so up the budget.
- Them: Yeah. So let. Let's stick that onto 120. Because in theory, it will be. If it's. It will be taking money off other days. So degree isn't spending. Yet, so I don't know.
- Me: This is dangerous being it over one day.
- Them: It is, but it's better information. I mean, we can look at. Well, to be fair, yesterday is a good day. It's a midweek. It's. It's. It's better than a weekend.
- Me: Yeah, it's just. It's just dangerous to base a spend on the whole of January on one day, though. About what this ban was.
- Them: Yeah. I mean. So the alternative would be.
- Me: Well, if we. If we look at. We, if we look at it over if we look at it over 14 days. And then do. Predicted and not predicted one percentage of daily of daily budget spent here. This then tells us how much of it is, whether it's up to its limits or not at this particular point in time. So things like the like we wouldn't necessarily do. There's a landscape Design is spending 100 of its 106 of his budget, so it is up to its limit, whereas the interior design diploma is only spending 77 of its budget.
- Them: Okay? Yeah. Y.
- Me: So it doesn't have the potential to grow yet.
- Them: Eah. Okay?
- Me: But what we're looking at is moving into a time where there's going to be higher demand in January.
- Them: Where it will.
- Me: So it's trying to second guess that what that's going to be, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Okay, so let's stick. So degrees obviously need to go up a bit. They're 50, I think. Let's put those up to 60. It'd be helpful to have that column so we can see it.
- Me: It. Would. Hope. You come.
- Them: Then the P max, that's only 20 a day, so I think that can be 40. Landscape. Yeah, let's put that up to 15, at least. What? What's the difference between the. Pmax at 24 4. And 28 5. So the bot.
- Me: They're just dates. Once a diploma wants a degree.
- Them: Oh, I see. Yeah.
- Me: These are just my notes at the end.
- Them: Yeah. Got it, got it. Okay. All right. I. I think that that's probably okay for the uae. Next stage, let's look at gcc.
- Me: Right. That's a good point. Actually, what I'll do. After the meeting today is actually. Actually mark these as gcc. That's if that's the terminology we're going to use for those particular countries. They're a little bit all over the show. These because we've got. We've got things like this one here. This is why I want to try and consolidate it all together. Because to do this kind of exercise with those regions is nigh on impossible.
- Them: Are we missing Qatar on there? Because Qatar would probably be a good. Are we missing Syria? On that. That tells you a good one.
- Me: Syria. Okay, I'm not saying Syria anywhere in the enrollment stats at all.
- Them: You think that's good one and. There's a lot of Syrians out here as well. They're quite design oriented. Okay? I'd be good to experiment at least. Terms of audience.
- Me: Yeah, it's just those four.
- Them: Okay, so we need to include Qatar and Syria.
- Me: Qatar will be somewhere else.
- Them: And then give it a bit more. All right.
- Me: It's doing this in a. In a. In. In this sort of last minute kind of way. Makes me uncomfortable that we're not actually covering all this because I don't know what. Where. Where you're going to be wanting to put all these budget changes. Based upon what I've got in here, because they are dotted around. This is. This is why. You know, thinking about doing this going to go into May, when we start to look at these individual regions makes me uncomfortable because we're at peak time now in January. We've absolutely got to get this right, that we're actually aiming the money at the right sort of places, but with the current structure the way it is. I'm going to find it very difficult to. To fulfill your wishes, to actually put it towards the right countries. Because they are dotted around.
- Them: Well, we can, we can put Qatar in there because Qatar is.
- Me: Yeah, but it's probably covered somewhere else. It's not as though Qatar is not actually covered, it's just not in that particular campaign.
- Them: But qatar is is a gcc country.
- Me: Yes. Yes, it is. But that's not a piece. Yeah, but that's not a GCC campaign yet.
- Them: And so we're to not have it in that one.
- Me: Those regions that I'm. I'm describing to you. Are what I found from the enrollments. They're not reflective of what the Google Ad structure is at the moment. Is what I would like it to be so we can get more tight with it.
- Them: Okay, sure. So what? What do you suggest?
- Me: Well, I'd like. I'd like to. I'd like to. I'd like to revisit this. I'd like to. I'd like to be able to. I can't even do that. I'd like to be able to do. Some organization of this, even if he's just a naming organization. So we can actually understand the way in which that the, the, the regions in that report are actually reflected in the campaigns that are on the, on the, the website. So if you are actually tweaking it, we know which countries we're actually doing. It towards. You know, that enrollment data for me is fairly. Is fairly new. We've been able to analyze it recently.
- Them: Okay? Should we?
- Me: But it's never been used before. In this. In this particular way. So even if it's just like, give me a couple of days just to get this into a naming convention that makes sense,
- Them: Okay, well, she would just save. Qatar is being covered. Because if it's not being covered, it's. It'd be quite easy just to add it in.
- Me: I'm just trying to find. It. Don't. Know why I can't search on that.
- Them: The rain stopped.
- Me: Yeah, catal's in. There.
- Them: Okay, which campaign is that under?
- Me: So it's bahrain. Cy being. Cyprus.
- Them: Okay, but Kuwait being covered in there.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: But it's also covered in the other one.
- Me: Yep. Yep.
- Them: So they'll be competing, will they?
- Me: The other one was a pmax campaign. I think this is a search campaign. This is what I mean. It's all over. It's all over the show. It needs consolidating. We've got Singapore in there as well. You. We've discussed it before about whether to have. Because of those regions. I think you. You mooted it in the first place. Is to say is to do it more as a time zone kind of thing. Because with the individual time zones, we're looking at individual cultures as well, which will match better with potentially with the text that we're going to be using in the, in the ads. And that would be a better way to do it, rather than what's happened before, is that this has been targeted towards intent. So it was the. It was the best performing ones grouped together and the middle and then the. And the. Then the lower ones and that suddenly just spread the whole thing out and gave it no sort of logical grouping at all. Because that's why we got Singapore and Cyprus in the. In the. The same things here. So it's just doing that, that consolidation.
- Them: We'll Qatar seems to be performing reasonably well. 29 clicks. For $29. 29.
- Me: Yeah. And if you look at this, Let's see if I. One conversion in that. In that period of time, which is probably not bad considering that level of spend.
- Them: One. Y. Eah.
- Me: But is that. Is that relationship between the two of them we need to. We need to fully understand.
- Them: Y. Eah. Okay, so should we just go through the budgets, then? And then? And then you want to have a little play with it and reword it?
- Me: Okay? Yeah.
- Them: Find that there. So, so the next one, let's have. If we just look at all the campaigns and if we can keep that percentage, we can. We should see straight away. So the Oman, Syria, the search campaign there is 102. So I think it's the fifth or sixth one down. $50 a day. I think we put that up to 60. So, interior design degree, uk. That can go up to 60. Remarketing UK looks like it's under spending that can go up to 50. Rest of the world diploma. Let's put that up to 50. Psalm30. So it's just the one. It's the one above, limited by budget. That's the one. So put that up to 50. Austria, france, holland, malta. That's the degree. So put that up to 20. So it's a few down.
- Me: See, that's the one that's smashing it.
- Them: Yeah. So let's put that up to 20. Sorry, let's first say 25. And what. What are other European ones?
- Me: That one there. That was that was Paul Wright back in the last. In the last change.
- Them: Actually, let's put that up to 20 then, because that seems like that was a good performer, wasn't it?
- Me: Y. Eah.
- Them: Okay? I think that's probably got the meat out the sandwich there. And just off the top, like, off the top of my head, I think we've added something like a hundred pounds to the budget, which is like, about. About 10%, so I think that's not a bad start.
- Me: Okay? Okay?
- Them: And then. And then we can revisit it. You know, either end of December or early Jan. And then if you, if you've got some ideas in the next couple of days of how you want to restructure it, just let me know and I can jump in the call with you.
- Me: Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna start off by just putting those regions in. If we use those as a starting point. Just in the campaign name. So if you say to me, what, which one's a European ones, at least we can actually see which of the European which are the GC3s and then whether there's. Yeah. I'm. I'm not going to change huge amounts of. Of reorganization. I'm on the first blinders guy at Sami window scares the life out of me every time. They wouldn't have cleaner comes. I'm not going to move things around dramatically at this stage, but I will as far as the naming conventions are concerned. I think that would be a good starting point.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Cool.
- Them: Sounds good. All right. Thank you.
- Me: The. The pmax text assets. Those. Those ones are sent over you okay for me to implement those.
- Them: I haven't had a chance to take a look at it. Do you mind just holding it off until today? I'll take a look today.
- Me: Okay? Okay?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Lovely.
- Them: Sure.
- Me: These guys. Bye. Bye now.
- Them: Okay. All right.

## Strategic Decisions

- Increase January budget by approximately 10% across campaigns
- Focus increased spend on UAE, Gulf countries, Europe, and UK
- Use January-May as a learning period for campaign restructuring
- Consider creating separate campaign for Saudi Arabia

## Key Learnings

- New landing pages showing potential improvement in performance
- Individual country performance varies dramatically (e.g., India at £2,700 CPE)
- Current campaign structure is scattered and needs consolidation
- Time zone and cultural grouping might be better than current targeting

### Campaign Performance Analysis by Geographic Region

- Enrollment data analysis by country/region from September to mid-December
- UK above last year’s performance levels
- International significantly above last year
- Current spend split: 46% UK, 54% international (previously 60/40 UK/international)
- Regional cost per enrollment (CPE) performance:
- Europe: strongest performer at £101 CPE (40 enrollments)
- Germany: £77 CPE showing good intent despite low numbers
- UAE: mixed performance across Emirates
- India: only 3 enrollments at £2,700 CPE since September
- GCC countries: Bahrain most expensive, Kuwait cheapest
- USA/Canada: expensive at current spend levels

### Weather Interruption and Regional Context

- Heavy rainfall in Dubai (rare occurrence)
- City not equipped for rain, causes flooding alerts
- Previous flooding damaged luxury vehicles
- Climate change discussion
- Delhi pollution making city “invisible” from smog
- Extreme temperatures (50°C+ in Mumbai, 63°C on Dubai golf course)

### Budget Allocation Strategy for January

- Immediate budget increases for peak January demand:
- UAE search campaign: £90 → £120 daily
- Degrees campaigns: £50 → £60 daily
- P-Max: £20 → £40 daily
- Landscape: increase to £15 daily
- Various European campaigns: increases to £20-25 daily
- Total increase: approximately £100 daily (\~10% budget boost)
- Focus areas for increased spend:
1. UAE (studio courses starting January)
2. Gulf countries (local targeting priority)
3. Europe (strong CPE performance)
4. UK (maintaining bread and butter market)

### Campaign Restructuring and Next Steps

- Current campaign structure scattered across regions
- Qatar covered in multiple campaigns (search + P-Max)
- Singapore and Cyprus grouped illogically
- Need consolidation by time zones/cultural regions
- Proposed naming convention updates to reflect regional groupings
- May 2025: comprehensive restructuring review
- Use January-May as learning period
- Analyze performance with new landing pages (only 2-3 weeks of data available)
- Consider separate Saudi Arabia campaign (high interest, Arabic creative performs well)
- New creative assets available from Dubai studio shoot (square, vertical, horizontal formats)

### Action Items

- Peter: Implement budget increases before January peak season
- Peter: Update campaign naming conventions to reflect regional groupings
- Peter: Hold off on P-Max text asset implementation until Paul reviews today
- Paul: Review P-Max text assets today
- Team: Revisit budget allocation and restructuring end of January
- Anweesha: Send new video creative assets to Peter for Google Ads

Them: Peter.
Me: Sorry. I just get my video on. All this playing funny Packers. You see me okay?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Can't see you. Right. Why is that? There we go. Bright and breezy this morning.
Them: Very good. Do I?
Me: Yeah. It's usually because I'm speaking about midnight or something.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: I wish.
Them: Hi. Hi. How are you?
Me: Good. Thank you. Ready for Christmas. Let's get this thing out the way with.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I was talking to someone the other day who's in Saudi, said it was quite amazing how little. Well, there is nothing, absolutely nothing. You go down our road at the moment, there's just lights everywhere. He said there's not an inkling of it anywhere. Not even from the expat community. Is it about the same there?
Them: No, no, it's. Christmas is everywhere here.
Me: Oh, is it?
Them: You can't. You can't miss it. It's. There's a radio show, 92 Dubai. 92. I listened to most of the time, and it's all Christmas songs now.
Me: Really?
Them: All the malls are all Christmas and yeah.
Me: Nice. Oh, very nice.
Them: When I was in Canada, it used to be a nightmare to shop. Actually, every time you're in a mall it's Christmas songs. But in Dubai, I always gift it. Firstly, I don't go to shopping malls. So that's the relevant of my life. That's done.
Me: That's a good idea.
Them: With.
Me: The more people like Joan, we should buy online. Thank you.
Them: It's like. Buy online. Yeah, just. Just leave all of it out of the way. Listen to your own music. You're good.
Me: Lovely. Or we're going to go way between Christmas and New Year. Get away from the madness. As usual. In the middle of Kilda Forest, just miles from anywhere. Very nice. Yes, I am a grinch.
Them: Yes, now it sounds good to me. Sounds good to me. I keep having. Oh, it's raining. There's water falling from the sky.
Me: Really?
Them: I'm we sure? What's going on? I haven't seen that for months. The water hasn't fall from the sky out here, so it's very specific. To you. It's probably coming your way. I'm Jamera partway, so. All right. It's coming to you. It's coming to you. Yeah. Started on the front of the house and it's coming to the back or the other way around. From a tropical country. It's very strange when I don't see rainfall all the. It's not okay. I'm. I'm from a reigning country. It just rains and it's very. It's very odd.
Me: Yep. Straight ahead.
Them: It's odd when there's no rain.
Me: It's really wet here at the moment. There's been some nasty flooding up in the Lake District. So, yeah, it's not great.
Them: We've actually got gills. So the. The Brits. It rains so much, we've actually developed gills over time.
Me: I can imagine there people are running out in the street going, oh.
Them: I think people here have gotten really terrified of rain. So ever since that happened, I believe it was last year or the year before that. And like, are there all the purchase at the Bentleys kind of just went underwater because the city is not equipped for rain.
Me: W. Ow.
Them: So anytime there's even a little bit, it's like we get alerts, like nationwide alerts to everyone's cell phones. There. There might be rain. And I'm just like, it's just a little rain.
Me: Really? We get alerts when it's not raining today. Nice one.
Them: Okay?
Me: Cool.
Them: So I thought. I thought I'd save this meeting for the last one pretty much of the year, because we want to have a. Have a tweet with the budgets, but I don't want to tweak them too early. And I think about now is about the right time. Obviously, we lose the uk. Team tomorrow. So if there is anything that we need desperately, we can just about get it done tomorrow, but I don't think there will be. I think we're basically good to go. We've got three of 18 now on wishes, so we've got two more on the on one course and 11 on. The other 11 of 18 on the other. Okay? I've also got the awareness campaign going and I spoke to Basma in the morning and we're thinking of doing like a separate India campaign as well. Just assign a small budget like 50 Durhams a day just for India that way at the moment, like we add group them with the Gulf and India. But she's saying it might be worthwhile to separate it. But keep an eye on it though, just, just because I don't want to waste even if it's 50 Durhams or 10 quid a day. I don't really want to. Want to waste it. And we do have. I think we. If we go through the Google Ads now, we've probably. We're probably underspending, really. We're in low mode at the moment.
Me: I've done a little bit of analysis on the enrollments. You know, I get the. I now get the spreadsheet coming from Kelly. So I've just broken it down into country and region. As to how they're performing, which hopefully. Will steer us a little bit towards the budgets on the individual campaigns. Do you want me to share that with you? Okay? This is where it's up to at the moment in terms of. Enrolments, bear in mind. I've just realized about five minutes before showing this. I've not actually put ICE uses a filter paid in full on this. So this enrollments that are showing on that spreadsheet, but at least it gives us an indication from a geographic perspective as to which particular regions are working and which ones aren't. So this is where the UK is against last year. And this is where the Internationals are. So the International has been the purple line. Against the last academic year on the blue line. Now the Geographic stuff. So what I've done is I've taken that spreadsheet and I've compared it with. The spend for the geographic locations on Google Ads. And then created. You'll see. Further down a percentage, so a cost per enrollment. So there is some regions that don't have a cost per enrollment. That's because we don't do any Google Ads. Advertising there. But again, this just gives us an idea on how efficient the individual geographic locations are. So there's a further breakdown of this. I'm sort of just going to quickly move through this. It just gives us an idea as far as international, where what savings.
Them: Sorry, peter, one question. Is this NDA and nma together or is this just NDA?
Me: And da.
Them: Okay? Because USA looks quite high and but they do reasonably well with nma and it just wouldn't perhaps if we've got NM.
Me: No, it's all NDA. This is straight off that. Straight off that spreadsheet.
Them: Okay? All right. Good to know.
Me: So 40% in the UAE. This is quite interesting ones. Things like Germany and Spain, they're actually quite strong. Switzerland and so on. So the regional groupings, this doesn't necessarily tie up with the campaigns. That's going to be the challenge when to adopt this is to actually put it to those individual campaigns. So you can see here the CPE column span sends to international and enrollments by those individual groups. So the uae, well, the Europe is the strongest. It's the cheapest out of all of them. Again. This doesn't include the uk. This is just international business. So 40 enrollments and 101 pound CPE, which is the lowest out of all of them. I think if you know, based upon this data, The initial thought is to fish where the fish are. Are we actually putting enough money into these? The European. Campaigns don't get a huge amount of money. You know, that's four grands that it's got out of that total allocation for the budget. He's broken this down. I'm not familiar with the term gcc, but it's the Gulf countries, isn't it? So it's grouped all those together.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: Again. High cost on that one. Rest of the world does particularly well. But obviously there's a bigger picture there as to exactly what they are. So the detailed breakdown. So I've now taken these regions and broken them down into the individual countries within that region. Germany. 77 pound cost per enrollment again. We don't really focus on that.
Them: It is. It is a good stat. But if you think about it is so such low numbers. It could be one ex student who's got their own company and has put four of their staff on and said, right, you need to do the course. And then it completely kind of.
Me: Yeah. Well. And you can view this in a number of different ways, these statistics, but they're the only ones we've got.
Them: Yeah.
Me: If you look. This is why I've grouped it together as a region. The region itself. Europe does very well. And it does very well in terms of cpe. So whilst these are low numbers, it's showing a certain level of intent. So the Romania one here, we don't do any Google Ads, advertising tools. So this is where it's come through from another source. It might be organic or direct. It's not immediately trackable. So uae, one of them.
Them: Yeah. We do? Romania. The metads.
Me: It could be sorry, apologies, and we get it could be from paid media.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Paid social media.
Them: No, no, I. I understand. I. I only brought it up because I know attribution is tricky, and those are always questions I have as well.
Me: Yeah. So uae. That is what it is. It's one of them was down in Abu Dhabi. So it's lumped them all together. So rest of the world. Some are strong, some are not. These cases in this to actually exclude places like South Africa, which is a real outlier. Do we really want to be spending this much money in one country? One We've only had one enrollment in that period of time, so this is September to mid December. GCC.
Them: Yeah. That's.
Me: Bahrain being the most expensive one, Q8 being the cheapest one. And there's the USA and Canada. So we do spend money there, but again, it's expensive. So 46% spending the UK and 53% spend in international. So, relatively speaking, we're just going to do this as a numbers exercise. The UK is underfunded, but you've got to reach a point where it's saturation point. The purpose of the exercise here is to break it out. Into new markets, into new international markets. So whether that's relevant or not, and we're going to be costing more money in the rest of the world than it is in the UK anyway, because it's the UK based enterprise. So this was the starting point for it, really.
Them: Yeah.
Me: This is quite enlightening. Since September we have only had three enrolments from India. Do we continue to spend as much as we have when it's costing us £2,700 per enrollment? Are we targeting it incorrectly? I don't know. But.
Them: When. When we're. When were those three? Because I know Amwish has just done a new video and have we put the new video up on Google Ads? The new India video on Google Ads. So that's that. Working with pmax. Okay, and how's that performing now with the new video? Is that. Getting better.
Me: Yes. Well, there's been three enrollments since the beginning of September, so I'm not too sure when they actually are. I mean, I could break that down even further than this. This was just a starting point for doing, like, percentages.
Them: Okay? Yeah, I think if. If we've had. I must say, I have had recently quite a few good calls from India. People who aren't idiots. They've called me up and said, you know, ask good questions about the course. So I think it'd be good to find out when those enrolments happen. Because if they've happened in the last couple of weeks, then then I think that's a positive sign. But I, I don't necessarily think we want to increase the budget in Indian necessarily. Perhaps just leave it running as it is. I, I would, I, I'd prefer just, I mean, just from, you know, a feel point of view, my natural reaction would be to increase uae, then increase Gulf countries. That's based on the fact that we've got these in studio courses starting in January. And so there is, you know, we do need to target the local area to. To actually get those sold because they're, you know, after. In February, they're worthless. We can only sell them once. Then, from what you've told me, it seems like giving Europe as a whole a bit more budget would be a, a good idea. And of course, we need to do UK as well, because that's the bread and butter. And we will find that in January, the, the costs will go up. People will start to be. You know, there'll be people. More people bidding in January than they are now.
Me: Absolutely.
Them: So best to get in here. Get in there for the tail end of December and get a few cheap clicks before. Before January starts. That that would be my gut. But I'm happy to be guided as well by any data that we've that that gives us. Some. Some good ideas.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Well, the next. The next stage with this. I mean, this. The purpose of this is to. Is to present this as. As a breakdown and as a. And as a template for the distribution of the budget. The next thing to do is to. Is to weigh this up against the actual campaigns themselves. To see what the individual campaigns. Because ideally, what I would like to do ultimately is to, is to use these regions. To create the campaigns, but I don't want to start breaking campaigns up now at this. At this particular point, I need to be done a bit more gradual.
Them: Exactly. And also remember that we've got a lot of downtime in the summer. So I think let's. Let's just do what we can now. Get it through till May and then in June we can have. We can perhaps start from scratch and say, right, where's. Where's the low click? Areas? Where's the high click areas? Let's group those together. Let's group those together. Let's simplify everything and give a bit more catchment to for pmax to be able to play with.
Me: Yeah. Well, if. I mean, if you.
Them: So.
Me: Have. Sorry. If you're happy with the principle of this, I can then come up with a plan for the actual allocation of the budget. So if you can. If you can let me know what the overall budget is going to be for international and for the uk, then I can spread that out amongst the campaigns that are actually producing. The conversions.
Them: Go on.
Me: As a next stage and present that and see what you think about it. And then, you know, the nice thing about this is that we're, you're applying the business knowledge to it and what's coming on in the, in the, in the, in the coming months. That you might say, well, let's not bother with that one, because it's like. Like you're saying about the studio. Let's actually put a bit more money towards that because there's. There's a new. A new thing that's coming up, so that's what I would propose. Is to. Is to. The next stage is to do those allocations.
Them: We. We've also got to adjust the elephant. The room as well, which is that the previous landing pages were awful, and they're much, much better now. And so we've only had, what, two or three weeks of new landing pages and so on. So. So we could just organically see a better roi. Anyway, just, just on the back of that, with set budget, same tactics, but yeah, let's, let's. I think those are good things to let's. Let's use from now till May as a learning period. We obviously need to increase budgets a bit for January, so let's get that ticked off. And then we'll have a lot more data for. For May. And then I think perhaps let's revisit this conversation as how. How we do it in May, because. Because we'll probably have a better lay of the land. What's interesting, though, is the graph you sent shows the UK is below. Where it was last year. And International is above where it was last year. Significantly.
Me: The Internationals above and UK is above.
Them: Uk is above.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So I can't really see that. I can't. Can you zoom in a little bit? It looks to me like the green is this year, is that not correct?
Me: No, the Greens last year.
Them: Oh, I see. Right. I was just wondering why the. The blue line is longer.
Me: Is.
Them: So well.
Me: It's the way in which the data has been held in the. In the spreadsheets. A bit weird.
Them: Okay? Well, I mean. That's a really, really good stat then, because the. If the UK's historically UK has been sort of 60% of advertising budget, international 40, then last year it was approximately 50 50, and now it looks like there's a slight lean towards international and it hasn't affected uk, and that kind of goes back to the theory that in the UK we are ranking top three for most of our keywords anyway, and so Google will have much less effect there. And like I said to you before, sometimes wonder if I should just completely cancel the UK ad budget and just see what happens, because if it's not particularly effective, we've doubled our ad budget for for International, but I haven't got. The appetite to take that risk.
Me: Or kahunas.
Them: So I think. I think perhaps a gradual, you know, if we. If we keep whatever the stat is Now, I think it's 55, 45, something along those lines, you know, that's probably not a bad ratio.
Me: So that's 40, 46% of spend in the UK, so we're spending more in the international.
Them: Yeah. Okay, can I also interject? One little thing from my side on the Gulf countries. I you were mentioning, Peter, that's about Rain's cost was extremely high and the results were quite low. Right. But even like I was chatting with Basma as well, like, we do get a lot of interest from Saudi, so it might be beneficial to kind of like, tweak that grouping so that Saudi gets more of the budget than Bahrain does.
Me: Y. Eah. And absolutely, that's the challenge, I suppose, Anweesha, because the way in which to run the budgets, you, you would actually like to say, well, let's do like with this one GCC as a campaign and the others as individual ad groups and allocate, you know, try and, try and play around with it that way. Which is not possible to do. And so in other ways to do it as. As individual campaigns for countries. But then they won't have enough conversions to be able to optimize correctly. So we have to. You have to lump it together a little bit.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: And, you know, when you're looking at Bahrain having, you know, three conversions in three. Sorry, one conversion in three months. You almost look at it and go, is that really worth it? Should we not be putting the more money into Saudi in Q8? And not bothering Bahrain again. That's a Kahuna's thing, you know. Do. Do you actually say enough is enough? If you need to look over. And the nice thing is there's a lot of data in that spreadsheet, you know, looking at over a longer period of time. If we were to see that Bahrain has had one conversion in four years, is it actually worth doing? Should it actually more spend be going into the others? But again, that's a. That's the thing between now and now in May to do. You know, are these. Are these. Are we actually chasing countries where it's. That it's not actually worth chasing?
Them: It might be worthwhile to have a Saudi campaign as well. That's just separate from the GCC ones, because even over. Even out here, like, whenever, like, I'm running creatives, that. That's. That's got, like, an Arabic woman woman on it. Like, that's one. Those are the ones that are, like, getting the maximum number of attention. Yeah, exactly. I think let's, let's keep it and let's, let's focus our time in the next four or five months on adapting copy to suit that place. And if we've got a video that has Arabic woman in it, that's that goes there. Maybe we get higher ROI on it. Just with copy chasing. So I think let's, let's use this next five months to tweak all the other, all the other variables. And then in May, we've got a pretty good idea what works, what doesn't work, and then we can completely revisit the targeting plan, the budgetary plan.
Me: Okay?
Them: And one more thing from my side. Sorry, Peter. So we did a studio shoot a couple weeks back out here, and we have, like, videos in square, vertical, horizontal. So those are the kind of creatives you feel that might be beneficial for Google Ads. I'm happy to send those over to you.
Me: Yeah, yeah, anything like that.
Them: Okay?
Me: Yeah, superb. I think, on your. On your point, though, Paul.
Them: Yeah.
Me: The one thing that Google's not going to like with this is hypnotized by the rain.
Them: I mean, it's absolutely.
Me: Is it?
Them: Bucketing down. Yeah, look. Look at that.
Me: Wow.
Them: That's in, what, five minutes?
Me: Gosh.
Them: I still haven't had rain. Out here. No, no, no. The same country. I think you're live. I just wanted. Just to make sure that the window is closed upstairs. Just give me a sec.
Me: I can look out the window any day, aren't we? It's actually stopped raining now. It's wet out there, but it's stopped.
Them: Well, it's not trading here at. We're in the same city. No.
Me: I was in.
Them: Not yet.
Me: Good old climate change. Of course, it doesn't exist. Climate change. Does it?
Them: My God. Like, you should hear the latest news come that that comes out of India. It's so terrifying. Especially like Delhi, that, like the capital of the country, it's invisible because we have smog like that. The level of pollution there, it's. Yeah.
Me: Really?
Them: It's hard to even imagine.
Me: Which is? People are ignoring this thing, aren't they? It's crazy.
Them: They're, they're living in it. And the amount of the. How obscene the property prices are out there and what they're breathing and what they're drinking, like the water, it's like, I don't know how these ultra rich people are living this. Way.
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I was. I was talking to a Google rep in Mumbai one day. And he said, I talked to the Google reps because you find them interesting. I'm not bothered about the Google Ad stuff because they just took the same stuff all the time anyway. And this. This guy said. He said, yeah, it's quite. It's quite warm here at the moment. I said. He said, it's so hot, usually I come to work on my bicycle. He said, I can't ride my bicycle today.
Them: Yeah, absolutely, I'll do that. For. What's the next.
Me: I said, how hot is. He said, It's 50 degrees. That's.
Them: One. Was. Bad. When was it? 50. When was this?
Me: Sorry.
Them: This would be a while back because I was in India recently and it wasn't 50 degrees.
Me: It was. Yeah, it took. It was two or three years ago. When I was speaking to him.
Them: Okay? I mean. You got to imagine it's 50 with the plus humidity. We get 50 out here, but we don't get that kind of humidity.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, is it over 50? It's unsustainable for human life or something. It's, you know, gets to a certain point.
Them: Yes.
Me: And it. And you could argue that, you know, if, if you lived in Sweden, you could. If it's like mine is 20 or something, that's unsustainable for human life, so people just stay indoors. It's the same now with the, the, the temper, the high temperatures, isn't it, that you. Stay indoors and put the aircon on. In the same way as you would do a heater.
Them: Also. Also bear in mind that when it says it's 49, 50, that's in the shade, it's not in the sun. When it's in, in the sun is much, much higher.
Me: Yeah. Yeah.
Them: We. We played a golf round a few years ago and it was. They've got a Mercury on. On the first hole and it was 63. On the mercury.
Me: 63.
Them: We've all got to move. Living in cities is no longer an option.
Me: I'll be in the bar, mate. I wouldn't be on the course.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, we only played four holes of that round and. And then we had a sandstorm, so we had to come in. Anyway, it was quite a brutal day.
Me: God. Yeah, I was going to say with your point about doing this in in May time. We've got to be careful not to do things sort of like all in one go, just a big bang approach. I want to be able. I want to be wriggling around a little bit now, moving, moving stuff around. Not in January, because that is, that is the busy time, but doing, doing some small changes to structure. Prior to that so it can settle in.
Them: Okay?
Me: And so I don't. I don't want to do anything too dramatic either, but it needs. It needs some sort of thought on restructure. I'll pass it by you before I do anything.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we'll talk about it.
Me: But just some thoughts. On it.
Them: We'll talk about it at the end of January, can't we? Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Them: All right, so should we. Should we lock in on the budget and see what we can tweak and where we should go?
Me: Well, can I. Can I. Do you want me to get together some ideas on. On budget?
Them: I think let's just have a look at what we're spending because there might be some obvious things that need to change. I know that we changed a lot. Recently.
Me: Because that seemed to work well, didn't it? Over over december. You know, using that, use that data, data driven approach to.
Them: Yes.
Me: Allocate the. The reductions in the budget. Seems to have worked well.
Them: Can you zoom in slightly?
Me: How's that?
Them: Yeah, that's better. Yeah. So if we list it in terms of budgets, so what our highest first, I don't think we need to change the uk. And that's probably not spending all it is still limited by budget. That's a Google problem. I don't think that. I think. Yeah, so? So that. That's plenty. What did it spend yesterday?
Me: Pretty much the budget. 285.
Them: 285. Yeah. Okay, look, that's the highest we've ever run it at, and I think let's. Let's just leave it there because it's pretty significant. So NDA interior design, uae. Now that's removed.
Me: Nothing.
Them: Okay?
Me: Wrong.
Them: So NDA uk brand. New custom no target.
Me: Look at that. That shows the drop in demand.
Them: What? Did. Yeah. What? Did what? Did uae spend yesterday?
Me: 2:31.
Them: No, I mean. Cost 15 1. So it's. But I see. So. So the search campaign spent 151 of the 90.
Me: Yeah.
Them: So I think that's something we can increase. So if we can put that at, say, 120.
Me: It's not limited by budget.
Them: It did spend 150 yesterday.
Me: So the budget is £90 over 30 days. Decided there was a bit of a something to go after yesterday, so up the budget.
Them: Yeah. So let. Let's stick that onto 120. Because in theory, it will be. If it's. It will be taking money off other days. So degree isn't spending. Yet, so I don't know.
Me: This is dangerous being it over one day.
Them: It is, but it's better information. I mean, we can look at. Well, to be fair, yesterday is a good day. It's a midweek. It's. It's. It's better than a weekend.
Me: Yeah, it's just. It's just dangerous to base a spend on the whole of January on one day, though. About what this ban was.
Them: Yeah. I mean. So the alternative would be.
Me: Well, if we. If we look at. We, if we look at it over if we look at it over 14 days. And then do. Predicted and not predicted one percentage of daily of daily budget spent here. This then tells us how much of it is, whether it's up to its limits or not at this particular point in time. So things like the like we wouldn't necessarily do. There's a landscape Design is spending 100 of its 106 of his budget, so it is up to its limit, whereas the interior design diploma is only spending 77 of its budget.
Them: Okay? Yeah. Y.
Me: So it doesn't have the potential to grow yet.
Them: Eah. Okay?
Me: But what we're looking at is moving into a time where there's going to be higher demand in January.
Them: Where it will.
Me: So it's trying to second guess that what that's going to be, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Okay, so let's stick. So degrees obviously need to go up a bit. They're 50, I think. Let's put those up to 60. It'd be helpful to have that column so we can see it.
Me: It. Would. Hope. You come.
Them: Then the P max, that's only 20 a day, so I think that can be 40. Landscape. Yeah, let's put that up to 15, at least. What? What's the difference between the. Pmax at 24 4. And 28 5. So the bot.
Me: They're just dates. Once a diploma wants a degree.
Them: Oh, I see. Yeah.
Me: These are just my notes at the end.
Them: Yeah. Got it, got it. Okay. All right. I. I think that that's probably okay for the uae. Next stage, let's look at gcc.
Me: Right. That's a good point. Actually, what I'll do. After the meeting today is actually. Actually mark these as gcc. That's if that's the terminology we're going to use for those particular countries. They're a little bit all over the show. These because we've got. We've got things like this one here. This is why I want to try and consolidate it all together. Because to do this kind of exercise with those regions is nigh on impossible.
Them: Are we missing Qatar on there? Because Qatar would probably be a good. Are we missing Syria? On that. That tells you a good one.
Me: Syria. Okay, I'm not saying Syria anywhere in the enrollment stats at all.
Them: You think that's good one and. There's a lot of Syrians out here as well. They're quite design oriented. Okay? I'd be good to experiment at least. Terms of audience.
Me: Yeah, it's just those four.
Them: Okay, so we need to include Qatar and Syria.
Me: Qatar will be somewhere else.
Them: And then give it a bit more. All right.
Me: It's doing this in a. In a. In. In this sort of last minute kind of way. Makes me uncomfortable that we're not actually covering all this because I don't know what. Where. Where you're going to be wanting to put all these budget changes. Based upon what I've got in here, because they are dotted around. This is. This is why. You know, thinking about doing this going to go into May, when we start to look at these individual regions makes me uncomfortable because we're at peak time now in January. We've absolutely got to get this right, that we're actually aiming the money at the right sort of places, but with the current structure the way it is. I'm going to find it very difficult to. To fulfill your wishes, to actually put it towards the right countries. Because they are dotted around.
Them: Well, we can, we can put Qatar in there because Qatar is.
Me: Yeah, but it's probably covered somewhere else. It's not as though Qatar is not actually covered, it's just not in that particular campaign.
Them: But qatar is is a gcc country.
Me: Yes. Yes, it is. But that's not a piece. Yeah, but that's not a GCC campaign yet.
Them: And so we're to not have it in that one.
Me: Those regions that I'm. I'm describing to you. Are what I found from the enrollments. They're not reflective of what the Google Ad structure is at the moment. Is what I would like it to be so we can get more tight with it.
Them: Okay, sure. So what? What do you suggest?
Me: Well, I'd like. I'd like to. I'd like to. I'd like to revisit this. I'd like to. I'd like to be able to. I can't even do that. I'd like to be able to do. Some organization of this, even if he's just a naming organization. So we can actually understand the way in which that the, the, the regions in that report are actually reflected in the campaigns that are on the, on the, the website. So if you are actually tweaking it, we know which countries we're actually doing. It towards. You know, that enrollment data for me is fairly. Is fairly new. We've been able to analyze it recently.
Them: Okay? Should we?
Me: But it's never been used before. In this. In this particular way. So even if it's just like, give me a couple of days just to get this into a naming convention that makes sense,
Them: Okay, well, she would just save. Qatar is being covered. Because if it's not being covered, it's. It'd be quite easy just to add it in.
Me: I'm just trying to find. It. Don't. Know why I can't search on that.
Them: The rain stopped.
Me: Yeah, catal's in. There.
Them: Okay, which campaign is that under?
Me: So it's bahrain. Cy being. Cyprus.
Them: Okay, but Kuwait being covered in there.
Me: Yep.
Them: But it's also covered in the other one.
Me: Yep. Yep.
Them: So they'll be competing, will they?
Me: The other one was a pmax campaign. I think this is a search campaign. This is what I mean. It's all over. It's all over the show. It needs consolidating. We've got Singapore in there as well. You. We've discussed it before about whether to have. Because of those regions. I think you. You mooted it in the first place. Is to say is to do it more as a time zone kind of thing. Because with the individual time zones, we're looking at individual cultures as well, which will match better with potentially with the text that we're going to be using in the, in the ads. And that would be a better way to do it, rather than what's happened before, is that this has been targeted towards intent. So it was the. It was the best performing ones grouped together and the middle and then the. And the. Then the lower ones and that suddenly just spread the whole thing out and gave it no sort of logical grouping at all. Because that's why we got Singapore and Cyprus in the. In the. The same things here. So it's just doing that, that consolidation.
Them: We'll Qatar seems to be performing reasonably well. 29 clicks. For $29. 29.
Me: Yeah. And if you look at this, Let's see if I. One conversion in that. In that period of time, which is probably not bad considering that level of spend.
Them: One. Y. Eah.
Me: But is that. Is that relationship between the two of them we need to. We need to fully understand.
Them: Y. Eah. Okay, so should we just go through the budgets, then? And then? And then you want to have a little play with it and reword it?
Me: Okay? Yeah.
Them: Find that there. So, so the next one, let's have. If we just look at all the campaigns and if we can keep that percentage, we can. We should see straight away. So the Oman, Syria, the search campaign there is 102. So I think it's the fifth or sixth one down. $50 a day. I think we put that up to 60. So, interior design degree, uk. That can go up to 60. Remarketing UK looks like it's under spending that can go up to 50. Rest of the world diploma. Let's put that up to 50. Psalm30. So it's just the one. It's the one above, limited by budget. That's the one. So put that up to 50. Austria, france, holland, malta. That's the degree. So put that up to 20. So it's a few down.
Me: See, that's the one that's smashing it.
Them: Yeah. So let's put that up to 20. Sorry, let's first say 25. And what. What are other European ones?
Me: That one there. That was that was Paul Wright back in the last. In the last change.
Them: Actually, let's put that up to 20 then, because that seems like that was a good performer, wasn't it?
Me: Y. Eah.
Them: Okay? I think that's probably got the meat out the sandwich there. And just off the top, like, off the top of my head, I think we've added something like a hundred pounds to the budget, which is like, about. About 10%, so I think that's not a bad start.
Me: Okay? Okay?
Them: And then. And then we can revisit it. You know, either end of December or early Jan. And then if you, if you've got some ideas in the next couple of days of how you want to restructure it, just let me know and I can jump in the call with you.
Me: Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna start off by just putting those regions in. If we use those as a starting point. Just in the campaign name. So if you say to me, what, which one's a European ones, at least we can actually see which of the European which are the GC3s and then whether there's. Yeah. I'm. I'm not going to change huge amounts of. Of reorganization. I'm on the first blinders guy at Sami window scares the life out of me every time. They wouldn't have cleaner comes. I'm not going to move things around dramatically at this stage, but I will as far as the naming conventions are concerned. I think that would be a good starting point.
Them: Okay?
Me: Cool.
Them: Sounds good. All right. Thank you.
Me: The. The pmax text assets. Those. Those ones are sent over you okay for me to implement those.
Them: I haven't had a chance to take a look at it. Do you mind just holding it off until today? I'll take a look today.
Me: Okay? Okay?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Lovely.
Them: Sure.
Me: These guys. Bye. Bye now.
Them: Okay. All right.
