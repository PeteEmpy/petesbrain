# Google Ads budget optimization for international campaigns


### Budget Reduction Strategy

- October spend 27k, targeting reduction to ~26k (saving Â£1.4k/month)
- Proposed approach: reduce campaigns by 95% rather than pause completely
  - No conversions = 95% reduction (landscape design, etc.)
  - Few conversions = 90% reduction
  - Converting campaigns = maintain current budgets
- Intelligence-based cuts using actual conversion data from Google Ads system
- UAE campaigns to remain unchanged until after 15 November (7 diploma spaces still available)

### Campaign Performance Analysis

- Interior Design Diploma PMAX MENA: Â£750 October spend, zero conversions
  - Proposed new budget: Â£37/month despite being âtop bracketâ campaign
- UK campaigns spending full Â£300/day budget unusual for November
- Offline conversions contributing only ~5% of total conversions
  - Still working on technical alignment with Google for better tracking
  - Gap between actual enrollments and tracked conversions remains significant
- Debate over conversion accuracy vs actual enrollments
  - Zero conversions doesnât guarantee zero enrollments
  - Conversions donât guarantee actual enrollments (India example: appeared high conversions, zero actual enrollments)

### Strategic Considerations

- International spend now exceeds UK spend
- UK naturally ranks top 3 for most keywords due to .ac.uk domain and backlinks
  - Potential to cut UK ad spend entirely and reallocate internationally
- Video content improvements in development for India/UAE PMAX campaigns
- November/December ideal for budget experimentation (typically lower months)
- Building knowledge database for more intelligent budget allocation decisions
  - League table approach for international targeting
  - GA4 integration for organic vs paid performance analysis
