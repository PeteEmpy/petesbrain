**Peter Empson:**
> Great, thanks. I'll do some crunching tomorrow

---

### Invoice Payment Query (August 2025)

**Peter Empson:**
> Hi Paul, just doing the accounts and there is a payment missing from 31/7 number 2388. You usually pay pretty quick and there was no payment in August

**Paul Riley:**
> Hi Peter, I paid from an AED accont last couple of months as there was no GBP left on the other account. can you check it wasn't sent for the other one?
>
> I can take a look later if not

**Peter Empson:**
> When I say I've been doing the accounts its actually my wife!
>
> She's reconciled the bank and there is an invoice without a payment so its either from a while back or its this months (issued at the end of last month). There isn't a reference number on the payments to be able to tie it to an invoice

**Paul Riley:**
> Haha, right ok. i'll check later

---

### Historical UK Data Request

**Peter Empson:**
> Is the data available per year for the UK in the same as it is for the international?

**Paul Riley:**
> No, shes just started it with a back up. I have asked to go as far back as possible

---

### October 2025 Enrolment Performance

**Peter Empson:**
> *[Shared chart image]* Looks as though October 2025 isn't going to be too bad after all

**Paul Riley:**
> we'll see. is this from the enrolment data sheet?

**Peter Empson:**
> Yes, it is

**Paul Riley:**
> Yeah I don't think it'll be a very bad month. Problem is UK made 190k last october and theyre just above 100 now. Compared to Sept we'll prob be slightly down but on last October we'll be way down. That said Nov-Feb should be up so not too concerned

---

### Top 5 Landing Pages Request (November 2025)

**Paul Riley:**
> Hi Peter, talking with our UX adviser. Can you send me the links of the top 5 pages/landing pages in terms of the most traffic from G ads?

**Peter Empson:**
> Morning Paul, here you go https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJktKam6vquuwYF0qMO1z8xmZ3P5o0tdsVNJrUlFLF8/edit?gid=0#gid=0 This is from the last 30 days

**Paul Riley:**

### Budget Reduction Request (November 2025)

**Paul Riley:**
> revenue data from last month. Need to get the budget under control quickly 24%
> *[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 16.42.19.png]*

**Paul Riley:**
> sent you this weeks enrolment data

**Peter Empson:**
> Where would you like the spend to be, roughly

**Paul Riley:**
> july/aug levels

**Peter Empson:**
> Okay I'll come up with a plan
>
> It will be based on where we are getting the actual enrolments from

**Paul Riley:**
> Can we see what our exact budget was in Aug and work from that? We had increased revenues but budget didn't move too much

**Paul Riley:**
> Free to chat?

**Peter Empson:**
> Will be at 3

**Paul Riley:**
> ok

**Peter Empson:**
> July 23K, Aug 27K, Sept 40K

**Paul Riley:**
> lets go aug levels now, july levels dec, 30k for Jan and aug levels till may, then july levels till july

---

### Revenue Analysis & Dubai Income Clarification

**Peter Empson:**
> IS the Dubai income everything non UK?

**Paul Riley:**
> All international
> Everything outside uk
> Yeah it's classified as Dubai because of Dubai office

**Peter Empson:**
> I've answered my own question. I've just verified that with the Excel spreadsheet. So I'm assuming Dubai income is equivalent to international income

**Paul Riley:**
> yes
> Dubai is the POS
> for all international

---

### Revenue Per Enrolment Analysis

**Peter Empson:**
> I've analysed the enrolment and financial data, and there's a significant finding I need to understand: Revenue per enrolment dropped from £7,217 (2024-25) to £2,467 (2025-26) - a 66% decline. Despite 210% enrolment growth (+218 students), total revenue only grew 6%. Can you help me understand what changed?

**Peter Empson:**
> Okay so found out what the issue is. I will now assume that the complete enrolment fee has been paid if it appears on that spreadsheet, rather than looking at the amount paid

**Paul Riley:**
> You've also got to consider revenue from NMA and learner loans which don't appear online the weekly report
> It won't be possible to get that data
> I don't think this data will work for what you want.
> Also admin are terrible with data in general. I only use the checkout and bank revenue which I don't have for the UK.

---

### Budget Reduction Plan Submission

**Peter Empson:**
> Here's the plan; it's all based upon conversions and CPAs. There was another version which actually paused campaigns. But instead of pausing, I've got a reduced by 95% which keeps the campaign active, which is probably preferable. Could you take a look and see what you think? It actually reduces the spend the October spend down by £14,000

> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E3sQRVHxPbg5mVsm2vp7vIBbMl3DK5gf_npOCxhKQYc/edit?gid=0#gid=0

**Peter Empson:**
> Any thoughts on this, Paul? Nothing's been applied yet

**Paul Riley:**
> Sorry Pater I missed this. Are you free to chat today?
>
> Whoile I remember, we need a little boost for UAE for studio diploma. Still have 7 seats to sell

**Peter Empson:**
> I've got 15 minutes at 11 o'clock. Is that enough?

**Paul Riley:**
> probably

>
> https://www.nda.ac.uk/study/courses/diploma-interior-design
>
> You won't need to do anything. Once weve pushed live it will take over from the previous URL. BUt if you have any comments before it goes live let us know

**Peter Empson:**
> Yep like the new page; it's a lot more clear. I like the price transparency as well.

**Paul Riley:**
> Pages are going liv e in 30. Don't think theres anything for you to do. they replace the old URL.s Just keep an eye oout for notifcations

### Duplicate Degree Landing Pages Discovery

>
> 3    Interior Design Degrees    https://www.nda.ac.uk/study/interior-design-degrees/    11834 clicks
> 4    Degrees Interior Design    https://www.nda.ac.uk/study/courses/degrees-interior-design    2398 clicks

**Paul Riley:**
> hi Peter, there are 2 degree landing pages in the sheet you sent thorugh. One has more clicks that the othe. what are they used for?
>
> Are they different ads?
>
> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJktKam6vquuwYF0qMO1z8xmZ3P5o0tdsVNJrUlFLF8/edit?gid=0#gid=0
>
> from this page you sent

**Paul Riley:**
> Looks like henry has changed the second degree page (the one with less hits) can we change both or is there a reason we have 2 versions?

**Peter Empson:**

### CRITICAL: Diploma Campaigns → Degree Page Issue Discovered

**Peter Empson:**
> Three asset groups in Diploma campaigns are sending traffic to the Degree page instead of the Diploma page:
>
> • UAE Diploma campaign - Remarketing asset group
> • UAE Diploma (older campaign) - Remarketing asset group
> • Australia/NZ Diploma campaign - Main asset group
>
> All three are live right now, which means people interested in Diplomas are landing on the Degree course page.

**Paul Riley:**
> terrific
>
> Maybe why we didn't fill the last studio diploma

**Paul Riley:**
> weve got the new diploma page live now. you know which one?
>
> https://www.nda.ac.uk/study/courses/diploma-interior-design/
>
> This is the new diploma page. Presume thats the best place to direct them?

**Peter Empson:**
> IMPACT (Last 30 Days):
> 271 clicks (£162 spend) sent to wrong page with 0 enrolments
> 0% conversion rate on wrong page vs 0.26% on correct page
> Estimated loss: ~0.7 enrolments/month (~8 enrolments/year)
>
> ROOT CAUSE:
> Three asset groups in Diploma campaigns are sending traffic to the Degree page instead of the Diploma page:
>
> 1. UAE Diploma campaign - Remarketing asset group (ACTIVE - this is the one losing enrolments)
> 2. UAE Diploma (older campaign) - Remarketing asset group (dormant, no traffic)
> 3. Australia/NZ Diploma campaign - Main asset group (dormant, no traffic)
>
> Change final URLs from:
> Wrong: /courses/degrees-interior-design/ (Degree page)
> Correct: /courses/diploma-interior-design/ (Diploma page)

**Peter Empson:**
> I've implemented the change

### Campaign Performance & Landing Page Concerns

**Paul Riley:**
> Ok, we reduced budget for some non performing campaigns recently. Where they all going to the correct pages?

**Peter Empson:**
> There is only this one campaign that's active

**Paul Riley:**
> Not sure what you mean

**Paul Riley:**
> There were a few campaigns which we paused or massively reduced budget. Are their landing pages correct?

**Peter Empson:**
> The asset group that this campaign sits in is the only one that's actually generating any traffic.

**Paul Riley:**
> If they aaren't correct maybe thats why they were under performing

**Peter Empson:**
> Yes this is a full analysis of where this URL was being used
>
> It has only been used in this one place - 271 clicks in 30 days
>
> The correct URL is being used everywhere else

**Paul Riley:**
> Which URL?

**Peter Empson:**
> The incorrect one

**Paul Riley:**
> Link?

**Paul Riley:**
> Weve changed the content on one url. Weve recently found out 3 campaigns were sent to the degree URL not the diploma URL
>
> Weve also reduce significantly or paused a few other campaigns based on performance.
>
> The question is, can we be sure that the lack of performance was because of disinterest or because they were pointing to either a degree url or a diploma URL that was poorly converting

**Peter Empson:**
> The Issue
>
> Three Diploma campaign asset groups were accidentally sending traffic to the Degree page instead of the Diploma page.
>
> Affected Asset Groups (Last 30 Days Performance):
>
> 1. Remarketing UAE - NDA | P Max Reboot | Interior Design Diploma - UAE 175 no target 28/5
>    - 283 clicks sent to wrong page
>    - £166.12 spent
>    - 48,896 impressions
>    - 0 conversions
> 2. Remarketing UAE - NDA | P Max | Interior Design Diploma - UAE 175
>    - 0 clicks (campaign appears paused/inactive)
> 3. Interior Design Diploma - NDA | P Max | Interior Design - Australia/New Zealand
>    - 0 clicks (campaign appears paused/inactive)
>
> Wrong vs Correct URLs:
>
> ❌ WRONG URL (what they were using):
> https://www.nda.ac.uk/study/courses/degrees-interior-design/
>
> ✅ CORRECT URL (what they should use):
> https://www.nda.ac.uk/study/courses/diploma-interior-design/

**Peter Empson:**
> It's only really one asset group we're talking about here and there is traffic coming through from the other asset group in the same campaign so no, I don't think that's the case

**Paul Riley:**
> Yes, but we reduced the budgets/ paused the priviouls campaigns outside the last 30 days

**Peter Empson:**
> The second asset group here is one that was replaced with the reboot campaign at number one
>
> So that leaves one campaign which is the Australia/New Zealand one

**Paul Riley:**
> I remeber looking at some of the campaigns when we paused or reduced budgets thinking they shuuld be primary campaigns but they had no conversions
>
> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E3sQRVHxPbg5mVsm2vp7vIBbMl3DK5gf_npOCxhKQYc/edit?gid=0#gid=0
>
> this was done at the beginning of this month. I think we need to look at the performance of the new landing pages and take a view on the budget requirments. I thought the old landing page was very confusing. Especially for non english speakers. Now weve fixed that we should look at increasing budgets for the january campaign in about 2-3 weeks
>
> Especially in the mena region. We only sold 11 of the 18 places for the DUbai studio course last week. That a loss of $25k which is almost all our google budget
