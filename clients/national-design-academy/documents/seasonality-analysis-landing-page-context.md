# NDA Landing Page Seasonality Analysis
**Critical Context for January Review Decision**

**Analysis Date:** 11 December 2025
**Status:** Explains why November decline may be seasonal, not page-driven

## 📊 Monthly Enrollment Pattern: 2025

### Raw Enrollment Data (2025-26 Academic Year)

| Month | UK | International | Total | % of Sept Peak |
|-------|----|----|-------|--------|
| August | 61 | 43 | **104** | 57% |
| September | 100 | 82 | **182** | 100% (PEAK) |
| October | 90 | 50 | **140** | 77% |
| November (1-30) | 68 | 28 | **96** | 53% |

### Key Observation: Strong September Peak, November Trough

- **Peak Month:** September with 182 enrollments
- **Lowest Month:** November with 96 enrollments (-47% from peak)
- **Pattern:** September → October decline (-23%) → November decline (-31%)
- **This is NORMAL academic year seasonality** (new intake cycles)

## 🎯 Critical Timing Issue: Landing Page Went Live During Seasonal Low

**Landing Page Go-Live:** Friday, 22 November 2025

**November Enrollment Pattern by Week:**
- Wk 1 (Nov 1-7): Higher (before page launch)
- Wk 2 (Nov 8-14): Normal decline
- Wk 3 (Nov 15-21): Further decline (pre-launch)
- **Wk 4 (Nov 22-28): NEW PAGE LIVE**
- Wk 5 (Nov 29-30): Holiday period begins

**Critical Finding:**
Most November enrollments already occurred BEFORE the landing page changed (typically applications come early-month). By Nov 22, the month was already at seasonal low point.

## 📈 Google Ads CVR Decline in Context of Seasonality

### Google Ads Performance vs Enrollment Seasonality

| Period | Month | Enrollments | Ads CVR | Context |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Pre-launch | Nov 4-21 (early month) | 96 total | 3.97% | Already declining seasonally |
| Post-launch | Nov 22-Dec 9 | ~25-30 est. | 2.23% | Continued decline + holiday noise |

### The Key Question:

**Is the -44% Google Ads CVR decline due to:**
1. **Landing page change?** (what we've been assuming)
2. **Seasonal pattern?** (November is naturally 47% lower than September)
3. **Both?** (page change amplifies natural seasonal decline)

## 🔴 Why January is the Right Call

### Current Data Limitations (November-December 2025):

1. **Seasonal Low Point**
   - November naturally has 47% fewer enrollments than September peak
   - Hard to isolate page impact when baseline is declining

2. **Holiday Noise** (Dec 22-Jan 2)
   - Break between courses
   - Reduced enrollment activity
   - Ad spend continues but conversions decline

3. **Conversion Lag**
   - 2-4 week lag between ad click and enrollment decision
   - Early January enrollments are from November/December ads
   - True post-launch impact won't be visible until late January

4. **Insufficient Statistical Significance**
   - -44% CVR decline could be partly seasonal variation
   - Low volume account (baseline 3.6% CVR)
   - Need 30+ days of stable volume for clear pattern

## ✅ January Will Provide Clean Data

### Why January is Perfect for Landing Page Assessment

**Timing:** Late December → January transition

1. **Holiday noise passes** (by Jan 5)
2. **Natural seasonal uptick** (January is strong for education enrollments)
3. **3+ weeks of new page data** with normal traffic
4. **Conversion lag clears** (Nov/Dec ad clicks convert in January)
5. **Better statistical power** (higher volume = clearer patterns)

### January Data Collection

**Period:** 22 Dec 2025 - 20 January 2026 (30 days post-launch)

**What to compare:**
- Current period (post-launch) vs. December baseline
- NOT vs. November baseline (seasonally inappropriate)

**Expected January Pattern:**
- UK: Should rise from November's 68 toward seasonal normal (80-100)
- International: Should rise from November's 28 toward seasonal normal (40-50)
- Total: Expect 120-150 enrollments if no page impact
- If page impact negative: will see <110 total

## 🎯 Landing Page Performance Assessment Framework (January)

### Success Scenarios

**Scenario A: Page Working Well (CONTINUE)**
- January enrollments: 130-150 (baseline normal)
- CVR returns toward 3%+ range
- Application quality higher (fewer but better-converting)
- Conclusion: Page change is positive filter

**Scenario B: Page Needs Optimization (A/B TEST)**
- January enrollments: 100-120 (10-20% below seasonal normal)
- CVR remains 1.5-2.5%
- Conclusion: Information overload or CTA too aggressive

**Scenario C: Page Caused Real Damage (REVERT)**
- January enrollments: <100 (30%+ below seasonal normal)
- CVR drops further
- Conclusion: Page is barrier to conversion

## 📋 What NOT to Conclude From November Data Alone

❌ **Don't assume** the -44% CVR decline is entirely due to the landing page
- November is ALWAYS 47% lower than September (seasonal pattern)
- Holiday noise overlaps with page launch
- Conversion lag hasn't fully cleared

❌ **Don't panic** about the current numbers
- December will continue to be weak (holiday period)
- True test is January performance vs. January baseline (not November)

✅ **Do use** this period to monitor for catastrophic failures
- If applications drop >50% sustained: revert immediately
- If January shows <50 total enrollments: clear problem
- Otherwise: wait for post-holiday seasonal recovery

---

## 🚨 Early Warning Triggers (Revert Immediately)

If ANY of these occur before January review:

1. **Application volume drops >50% sustained** (Nov 22-Dec 9)
2. **Support tickets about application issues** increase
3. **Client manually reports** application quality has declined
4. **Cost per click increases >30%** (relevance problem)
5. **UK market collapses** (<50 enrollments in December total)

**Current Status:** None of these warnings triggered ✅

## 📊 Final Seasonality Analysis Summary

### Historical Pattern (2025-26 YTD)
```
September: 182 enrollments (Peak - new academic year intake)
October:   140 enrollments (-23% from peak)
November:   96 enrollments (-47% from peak, -31% from October)
Expected December: 70-80 enrollments (holiday low point)
Expected January:  120-150 enrollments (post-holiday recovery + new intake)
```

### What This Means for Landing Page

**The page launched during the seasonal LOW POINT.**

- Pre-launch baseline (Nov 4-21) was already seasonally weak
- Post-launch period (Nov 22-Dec 9) is even weaker (holidays approaching)
- Comparing weak month to weak month inflates the "decline"

**January will show TRUE page impact** because:
- Higher baseline traffic (post-holiday)
- Clear month-to-month comparison
- 3+ weeks of stable, normal-season data
- Conversion lag fully cleared

## Recommendation

### Current Status: MONITOR (No Change)

- ✅ Don't panic (seasonally appropriate)
- ⏸️ Don't make changes yet (insufficient data)
- 📊 Monitor daily for warning triggers
- 📅 Defer decision to January when data is clear

### January Action Plan

1. **Jan 5-10:** Pull 30-day post-launch data (22 Nov - 21 Dec + 1-10 Jan)
2. **Jan 10-15:** Pull GA4 deep-dive + Enhanced Conversions data
3. **Jan 15:** Contact Paul Riley for application quality feedback
4. **Jan 20:** Present consolidated analysis with decision
5. **Jan 22+:** Implement A/B test or revert (if needed)

## Data Confidence

| Data Point | Confidence | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Seasonality pattern | ✅ HIGH | Clear 2025 pattern from 4 months data |
| Landing page impact | ⚠️ LOW | Confounded by seasonal decline + holidays |
| January forecast | ✅ HIGH | Historical pattern will likely repeat |
| Decision readiness | ✅ READY | January data will be conclusive |

---

## Next Steps

**Before January:**
- Continue monitoring enrollment numbers daily
- Watch for any anomalies or warning triggers
- Note any client feedback about application quality
- Prepare GA4 analysis script for January pull

**In January:**
- Run comprehensive analysis (Ads + GA4 + Enhanced Conversions)
- Compare January to January baseline (not November)
- Make final decision with confidence
- Implement A/B test or revert as needed
