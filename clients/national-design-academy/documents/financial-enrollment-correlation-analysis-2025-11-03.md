## 4. Market-Specific Analysis

### UK Market

**Income Performance:**
- 2024-25: £461,250 (61 enrollments) = £7,561/enrollment
- 2025-26: £390,083 (190 enrollments) = £2,053/enrollment
- **Change:** -15.4% income despite +211.5% enrollments

**Estimated Cost Per Enrollment:**
- 2024-25: £731/enrollment
- 2025-26: £338/enrollment
- **Improvement:** -53.8%

**Key Insight:** UK is acquiring more students at lower cost, but each student is generating significantly less revenue (-73% per student). This suggests either:
1. Course mix shift (lower-priced courses)
2. Payment plan changes (less upfront payment)
3. Discounting or promotions

---

### International Market (Dubai)

**Income Performance:**
- 2024-25: £289,296 (43 enrollments) = £6,728/enrollment
- 2025-26: £404,160 (132 enrollments) = £3,062/enrollment
- **Change:** +39.7% income with +207% enrollments

**Estimated Cost Per Enrollment:**
- 2024-25: £650/enrollment
- 2025-26: £504/enrollment
- **Improvement:** -22.5%

**Key Insight:** International is the growth engine (+39.7% revenue) with improving cost efficiency. Revenue per enrollment dropped 54.5%, but less severely than UK market.

---

## 5. Key Findings & Implications

### 🔴 CRITICAL CONCERNS

**1. Revenue Per Enrollment Collapse**

The 65.8% drop in revenue per enrollment is the most significant finding. Possible causes:

- **Course Mix Shift:** More students enrolling in lower-priced courses (e.g., short courses vs. diploma programs)
- **Payment Plans:** Increased use of installment plans (revenue recognized over time, not upfront)
- **Discounting:** Heavy promotions to drive volume
- **Student Quality:** Lower-commitment students who pay less upfront

**Action Required:** Urgent analysis of:
- Course enrollment breakdown by price tier
- Payment method distribution (full vs. installment vs. loan)
- Average order value trends by month
- Scholarship/discount usage

---

**2. UK Market Decline**

UK income dropped 15.4% despite 3x enrollment growth:

- Market appears saturated or highly competitive
- May indicate shift to lower-value courses
- Possible conversion tracking issues (revenue attribution)

**Action Required:**
- Review UK campaign targeting and messaging
- Analyze UK course mix changes
- Check conversion tracking accuracy (offline conversions)

---

**3. ROAS Efficiency Loss**

ROAS dropped from 819% to 538% (-34% efficiency):

- Still profitable (5.4x return) but declining rapidly
- Ad spend increased 61% while income only grew 6%
- Diminishing returns from increased spend

**Action Required:**
- Audit Google Ads campaigns for waste
- Review bidding strategies and ROAS targets
- Consider budget reallocation (reduce less efficient campaigns)

---

### ✅ POSITIVE INDICATORS

**1. Enrollment Volume Growth**

+209.6% enrollment growth demonstrates:
- Strong demand generation
- Effective marketing reach
- Brand awareness building

**2. Cost Per Enrollment Improvement**

Cost per enrollment down 47.9%:
- More efficient at driving applications
- Good sign for top-of-funnel performance

**3. Dubai Market Growth**

+39.7% revenue growth with improving efficiency:
- Dubai is the growth engine
- International demand strong
- Less price-sensitive market (revenue/enrollment higher than UK)

---

## 6. Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did Revenue Per Enrollment Drop So Dramatically?

**Most Likely Causes (ranked by probability):**

1. **Course Mix Shift** (HIGH probability)
   - More students enrolling in short courses (£325-£1,250) vs. diplomas (£1,645-£3,225)
   - Data needed: Enrollment breakdown by course type

2. **Payment Plan Adoption** (HIGH probability)
   - Increased use of installment plans or loans
   - Revenue recognized over time, not as lump sum in current period
   - Data needed: Payment method distribution

3. **Promotional Activity** (MEDIUM probability)
   - Discounts or scholarships to drive volume
   - Data needed: Average discount rate per enrollment

4. **Timing/Attribution Lag** (MEDIUM probability)
   - Students enrolled but haven't paid full course fee yet
   - Installments not yet collected
   - Data needed: Payment collection timeline

5. **Conversion Tracking Issues** (LOW probability)
   - Revenue attribution not matching enrollments
   - Unlikely given data from client's own systems

## 8. Questions for Client

To complete this analysis, please provide:

1. **Course Enrollment Breakdown:**
   - How many students enrolled in each course type?
   - What was the average course fee by market?

2. **Payment Method Distribution:**
   - What % paid in full vs. installments vs. loans?
   - What is the typical payment timeline?

3. **Revenue Recognition:**
   - Is revenue recognized at enrollment or over course duration?
   - Are installment payments reflected in YTD income?

4. **Historical Context:**
   - Did you change pricing, course offerings, or promotions this year?
   - Any major strategic shifts we should be aware of?

5. **Goals:**
   - What is more important: enrollment volume or revenue per student?

## 9. Data Quality Notes

**Assumptions Made:**
- "Dubai" income represents all international students (132 enrollments)
- Ad spend attribution is proportional to income by market
- All enrollments in dataset are paid enrollments (not applications)

**Potential Data Limitations:**
- Revenue may be recognized differently than enrollment timing
- Installment plans may create revenue/enrollment timing mismatch
- Google Ads spend may not be split evenly between UK/International campaigns

---

## Appendix: Detailed Calculations

### ROAS Formula:
```
ROAS = (Total Income / Total Ad Spend) × 100
```

### Cost Per Enrollment:
```
Cost/Enrollment = Total Ad Spend / Total Enrollments
```

### Revenue Per Enrollment:
```
Revenue/Enrollment = Total Income / Total Enrollments
```

### Market-Specific Cost (Estimated):
```
UK Cost/Enrollment = (Google Spend × UK Income %) / UK Enrollments
International Cost/Enrollment = (Google Spend × Dubai Income %) / Int'l Enrollments
```
