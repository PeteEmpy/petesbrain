## Why Excluded

User requested removal of all UAE campaigns from the budget import. Reasons could include:
- Separate budget management for UAE market
- Different strategic priorities for UAE campaigns
- Awaiting additional data before making UAE budget decisions
- Client-specific UAE market considerations

## Impact on Budget Plan

### With UAE (Original)
- Total campaigns: 39
- Total daily: £857.33
- Total monthly: £26,097.13

### Without UAE (Final)
- Total campaigns: 33
- Total daily: £795.07
- Total monthly: £24,201.93

### Difference
- Campaigns excluded: 6
- Daily budget excluded: £62.26
- Monthly budget excluded: £1,895.19

## What This Means

1. **November import CSV**: Contains 33 campaigns (no UAE)
2. **UAE campaigns**: Will keep their current budgets (no change)
3. **Total account spend**: Non-UAE campaigns reduced by 40%, UAE unchanged

## If You Want to Change UAE Budgets Later

To adjust UAE campaign budgets separately:

1. **Create a separate UAE budget CSV** with just the 6 UAE campaigns
2. **Set new budgets** as desired
3. **Import separately** via Google Ads Editor

Or:

1. **Manually adjust** in Google Ads Editor or UI
2. **Edit each campaign** individually

## UAE Campaign Performance Context

### High CPA Campaigns (were planned for 80% reduction)
- **NDA | UAE | Search | Interior Design Diploma No Target**: CPA £958, 7.5 conv YTD
- **NDA | UAE | Search | Interior Design Degree No Target**: CPA £1,747, 2 conv YTD

These were flagged for major budget reductions due to very high CPAs, but are now excluded from the November import.

### Performing Campaigns (were planned to KEEP)
- **NDA | P Max Reboot | Interior Design Diploma - UAE 175 no target 28/5**: CPA £195, 17.27 conv YTD (good performance)

This campaign was performing well and would have been kept at £20/day.

## Recommendation

Since the high-CPA UAE campaigns remain at their current budgets, consider:

1. **Monitor UAE performance closely** in November
2. **Review UAE CPAs** after 2-4 weeks
3. **Decide on UAE budget strategy** separately from the rest of the account

The original budget plan recommended:
- 80% reduction for the two high-CPA UAE diploma/degree campaigns
- Keep the performing PMax UAE campaign

These recommendations are still valid if you decide to adjust UAE budgets later.
