Hi Paul,

I've investigated why the degree URL appears twice in your top 5 landing pages spreadsheet.

IMPACT (Last 30 Days):
271 clicks (£162 spend) sent to wrong page with 0 enrolments
0% conversion rate on wrong page vs 0.26% on correct page
Estimated loss: ~0.7 enrolments/month (~8 enrolments/year)

ROOT CAUSE:
Three asset groups in Diploma campaigns are sending traffic to the Degree page instead of the Diploma page:

1. UAE Diploma campaign - Remarketing asset group (ACTIVE - this is the one losing enrolments)
2. UAE Diploma (older campaign) - Remarketing asset group (dormant, no traffic)
3. Australia/NZ Diploma campaign - Main asset group (dormant, no traffic)

THE FIX:
Change final URLs from:
Wrong: /courses/degrees-interior-design/ (Degree page)
Correct: /courses/diploma-interior-design/ (Diploma page)

Takes 10 seconds via API. Should recover ~0.7 enrolments/month.

Want me to fix these URLs?

Pete
