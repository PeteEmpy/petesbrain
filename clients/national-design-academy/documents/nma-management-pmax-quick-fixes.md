# NMA Management PMax - Quick Fixes (Amend Existing Campaign)

**Campaign**: NMA | P Max | UK | Management 100
**Problem**: 13,718 clicks → 1 conversion (targeting job seekers not students)
**Time to fix**: 30 minutes

---

## Quick Fix Approach

Instead of rebuilding, make these 3 critical changes to existing campaign:

---

## Fix 1: Add Target CPA (5 minutes)

**Current**: Max Conversions with no target
**Fix**: Add Target CPA £150

**Steps**:
1. Go to campaign → Settings → Bidding
2. Click "Change bid strategy"
3. Keep "Maximize conversions" selected
4. ✅ Check "Set a target CPA (optional)"
5. Enter: **£150**
6. Save

**Why**: Prevents overspending per conversion (currently £917)

---

## Fix 2: Add Audience Exclusions (10 minutes)

**Current**: No exclusions (attracting job seekers)
**Fix**: Exclude job seekers

**Steps**:
1. Go to campaign → Audiences → Edit audience segments
2. Click "Exclusions" tab
3. Click "+ Exclusions"
4. Search for and add:
   - ❌ **Job Seekers**
   - ❌ **Employment**
   - ❌ **Recruitment Services**
5. Click "Create custom segment" → "People who searched for any of these terms"
6. Name: "Motorsport Job Seekers"
7. Add terms:
   ```
   motorsport jobs
   F1 jobs
   motorsport careers
   racing jobs
   motorsport manager jobs
   motorsport employment
   work in motorsport
   motorsport team jobs
   ```
8. Save and add as exclusion
9. Save campaign

**Why**: This stops ads showing to people looking for motorsport JOBS

---

## Fix 3: Add Placement Exclusions (10 minutes)

**Current**: Ads showing on job boards
**Fix**: Block job sites

**Steps**:
1. Go to campaign → Content → Placements
2. Click "Exclusions"
3. Click "+ Exclusions"
4. Select "Enter multiple placements"
5. Add these URLs (one per line):
   ```
   linkedin.com/jobs
   indeed.com
   indeed.co.uk
   reed.co.uk
   cv-library.co.uk
   totaljobs.com
   monster.co.uk
   glassdoor.com
   motorsportjobs.com
   autosport.com/jobs
   ```
6. Save

**Why**: Even if job seekers see ads, they won't see them on job boards

---

## Fix 4: Update Asset Copy (15 minutes) - CRITICAL

**Current problem**: Headlines likely say "career" or "become a manager"
**Fix**: Change to say "course" or "study"

**Steps**:
1. Go to campaign → Asset groups
2. Click on the asset group name
3. Go to "Headlines" section
4. Click "Edit"
5. Review each headline:
   - If it says "career", "job", "work", "become" → **Replace it**
   - Must say "course", "study", "learn", "degree", "MBA"

**Replace any headlines like this**:
- ❌ "Start Your Motorsport Career"
- ❌ "Become a Motorsport Manager"
- ❌ "Work in Formula 1"

**With headlines like this**:
- ✅ "Online Motorsport Management Course"
- ✅ "Study Motorsport Management Online"
- ✅ "MBA in Motorsport Business"
- ✅ "Learn Motorsport Business Skills"
- ✅ "Motorsport Management Degree"

6. Same for Descriptions - must emphasize STUDYING not WORKING
7. Save

**Why**: This is how job seekers immediately know it's not for them

---

## Fix 5: Add Negative Keywords (5 minutes)

Even though PMax doesn't use keywords, you can add negatives:

**Steps**:
1. Go to campaign → Settings → More settings
2. Find "Negative keywords" section
3. Click "Add negative keywords"
4. Add these:
   ```
   job
   jobs
   hiring
   career
   careers
   employment
   vacancy
   vacancies
   recruitment
   salary
   ```
5. Save

**Why**: Extra layer of protection

## Expected Impact

### Before Fixes:
- Clicks: 13,718
- Conversions: 1
- CVR: 0.007%
- CPA: £917

### After Fixes (30 days):
- Clicks: 400-600 (much lower, more qualified)
- Conversions: 20-25
- CVR: 0.3-0.5% (40-70x improvement)
- CPA: £120-150

---

## Monitoring (First 7 Days)

**Day 1-2**: Impressions may drop 50%+ (this is GOOD - less waste)
**Day 3-5**: Should see first conversions (2-3)
**Day 7**: Should have 3-5 conversions vs 0.23/week previously

**Red flag**: If zero conversions after 7 days → Check conversion tracking

---

## Priority Order

If you only have 15 minutes, do these in order:

1. ✅ **Add Target CPA £150** (5 min) - Prevents overspending
2. ✅ **Exclude job seekers** (5 min) - Stops wrong audience
3. ✅ **Update headline copy** (5 min) - Fixes messaging

Do the rest when you have time.
