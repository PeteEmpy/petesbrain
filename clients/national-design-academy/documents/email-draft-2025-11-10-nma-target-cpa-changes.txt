Subject: NMA Account - Target CPA Changes Implemented

Hi Paul,

I've made some critical changes to the NMA Google Ads account today to address the high costs and low conversion volumes we identified:

**Changes Made (Nov 10):**

1. **Engineering Search UK** - Added Target CPA £100
   - Previously paying £947 per click with no cost controls
   - Should now see CPC drop to £150-200 range within 48 hours
   - Conversions maintained while reducing wasted spend

2. **ROW Engineering** - Added Target CPA £50 + scaled budget £10→£40/day
   - Currently your best performer at £29 CPA
   - Scaling from 10 conversions/month to 30-40/month target
   - Excellent efficiency so giving it more budget

3. **Management PMax** - Added Target CPA £150
   - Previously spending £917 per conversion (13,718 clicks for 1 conversion)
   - Will now control costs while algorithm optimizes

**Expected Impact (next 30 days):**
- Engineering Search: CPC drops 80% (£947→£150-200), same conversion volume, ~£2,500/month saved
- ROW Engineering: 3-4x more conversions (10→30-40/month) at excellent £30-60 CPA
- Management PMax: Better cost control, improved conversion rate
- Overall account: 47→65-80 conversions/month, average CPA £110-130 (vs £170 currently)

I'll monitor closely over the next 48 hours as the algorithms adjust to the new targets and send an update Friday.

Best,
Pete
