# November Budget Strategy Summary

**Date**: November 5, 2025
**Strategy**: Hybrid approach - KEEP top performers, REDUCE underperformers

## Key Decision

**KEEP campaigns maintain their current Google Ads budgets** (not August baseline). This ensures:
- No disruption to top-performing campaigns
- Budget cuts focused on underperforming/zero-conversion campaigns
- Minimal risk to account performance

## Budget Comparison

| Metric | Current (Oct) | November (New) | Change |
|--------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Total Monthly** | £39,996.40 | £26,097.13 | -£13,899 (-35%) |
| **Total Daily** | ~£1,314 | £857.33 | -£457 (-35%) |
| **Campaigns** | 39 | 39 | 0 (no pauses) |

## Strategy Breakdown

### KEEP Campaigns (12 campaigns - £18,600/month)
**Strategy**: Maintain current Google Ads budgets exactly as configured
**Why**: Top performers with good CPA (£38-£300) and strong conversion volume

| Campaign | Daily Budget | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| NDA \| UK \| Search \| Interior Design Diploma 140 Ai Max 5/8 | £300.00 | Best CPA (£95), highest converter |
| NDA \| UK \| Search \| Brand 100 New Customer 1/8 No Target | £110.00 | Strong brand campaign |
| NDA \| OM/SA/BH/KW \| Search \| Interior Design Diploma No Target | £50.00 | Key MENA market |
| NDA \| US/CA \| Search \| Interior Design Degree 250 No Target 15/9 | £40.00 | North America growth |
| NDA \| P Max \| Interior Design Diploma - UK 100 Remarketing | £30.00 | Remarketing value |
| NDA \| P Max Reboot \| Interior Design Diploma - ROTW 200 13/1 No target 28/5 | £30.00 | Good ROTW volume |
| NDA \| P Max | Interior Design - India 135 29/11 No Target 10/9 | £27.00 | Strong India performance |
| NDA \| UK \| Search \| Landscape Design Diplomas No Target | £20.00 | Niche UK product |
| NDA \| P Max \| Interior Design Degree - ROTW 200 13/1 No Target 23/9 | £20.00 | Global reach |
| NDA \| P Max \| Interior Design Degree - UK 100 17/3 No Target 30/4 | £20.00 | Best CPA (£38) |
| NDA \| Search \| Interior Design Diploma - USA/ Canada 250 Split 11/3 | £20.00 | North America |
| NDA \| Search \| Interior Design Degree - Austria/France/Holland/Malta/Germany/Sweden | £16.69 | Excellent EU CPA (£65) |

**Note**: One campaign appears in both KEEP and REDUCE categories:
- **NDA | P Max Reboot | Interior Design Diploma - UAE 175 no target 28/5**: Listed as KEEP in plan, but receives August baseline budget (£20/day actual = £20/day new)
- **NDA | ROTW | Search | Brand Inclusion No Target**: Listed as KEEP, receives August baseline (£45/day actual → £20.10/day new)

These appear to be classification discrepancies in the source spreadsheet.

### REDUCE_50 Campaigns (6 campaigns - £3,898/month)
**Strategy**: 50% reduction to test efficiency at lower budgets
**Why**: High CPA (£380-£606) but some conversion volume

**Biggest cuts**:
- NDA | Search | Interior Design Degree- UK 120 No Target 24/4: £100/day → £42.64/day (-57%)
- NDA | P Max | Interior Design Diploma - UK 100 Remarketing: £30/day → £37.21/day (+24% - classification error?)
- NDA | ROTW | Search | Brand Inclusion No Target: £45/day → £20.10/day (-55%)

### REDUCE_80 Campaigns (8 campaigns - £1,367/month)
**Strategy**: 80% reduction due to very high CPA (£550-£2,100)
**Why**: Extremely high CPAs, minimal conversion volume

**Example cuts**:
- NDA | UAE | Search | Interior Design Diploma No Target: £90/day → £17.57/day (-80%)
- NDA | UAE | Search | Interior Design Degree No Target: £50/day → £8.54/day (-83%)
- NDA | BH/CY/KW | Search | Interior Design Degree No Target: £30/day → £5.16/day (-83%)

### REDUCE_90 Campaigns (3 campaigns - £144/month)
**Strategy**: 90% reduction to minimal test budgets
**Why**: Very low conversion volume (0.09-0.5 conv YTD), extreme CPAs (£2,289-£12,167)

**Cuts**:
- NDA | UK | Search | Interior Design Careers No Target: £20/day → £2.23/day
- NDA | P Max | Interior Design Degree - Oman/Saudi/Bahrain/Kuwait/Qatar: £10/day → £1.40/day
- NDA | BH/IN/CYSI | Search | Landscape Design Course No Target: £10/day → £1.11/day

### REDUCE_95 Campaigns (10 campaigns - £181/month)
**Strategy**: 95% reduction to micro test budgets (£0-£1.23/day)
**Why**: Zero conversions YTD despite significant spend

**Cuts**:
- NDA | Search | Interior Design Degree - Oman/Saudi/Bahrain/Kuwait 175: £45/day → £1.19/day (-97%)
- NDA | IN | Search | Interior Design Degree No Target: £20/day → £0.86/day (-96%)
- NDA | EUR | Search | Landscape Design Courses 65: £15/day → £0.00/day (-100%)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **KEEP campaigns**: No change to budgets = no disruption
- **Strong performers protected**: Top 12 campaigns maintain full budgets

### Medium Risk
- **REDUCE_50/80 campaigns**: Some have conversion volume that may drop
- **Mitigation**: Monitor CPA and conversion rate for first 2 weeks

### High Risk
- **REDUCE_90/95 campaigns**: Minimal budgets may cause disapprovals
- **Mitigation**: These had 0 conversions anyway, so limited downside

## Rollback Plan

Both CSV files are ready:

1. **nda_november_budgets_for_google_ads_editor.csv**
   - New budgets (this strategy)
   - Total: £857.33/day (£26,097/month)

2. **nda_october_current_budgets_rollback.csv**
   - Current Google Ads budgets (exact)
   - Total: £1,042/day (£31,718/month)

If November budgets cause issues, import rollback CSV to restore exact current settings.

## Success Metrics

**Week 1**:
- No major disapprovals on REDUCE campaigns
- KEEP campaigns maintain performance (CPA, conv rate)

**Week 2-4**:
- Overall account CPA stays below £400
- Conversion volume drops <20%
- Budget utilization >80% on KEEP campaigns

**Month 1**:
- Monthly spend ~£26,000

- Conversion volume vs August baseline

## Next Steps
