## 🏆 Top Opportunities

### 1. European Markets Are Exceptional (But Underfunded)

**Discovery**: Countries like Hungary, Latvia, Iceland, Spain, and Germany show **3,000-10,000% ROAS** but receive minimal ad spend.

| Country | Spend | Enrollments | ROAS | CPA |
|---------|-------|-------------|------|-----|
| 🇭🇺 Hungary | £68 | 2 | **10,223%** | £34 |
| 🇱🇻 Latvia | £38 | 1 | **9,222%** | £38 |

| 🇩🇪 Germany | £712 | 7 | **3,442%** | £102 |

**Recommendation**: These countries are receiving **incidental reach** from broad targeting but show exceptional conversion efficiency. **Launch dedicated campaigns** in these markets.

**Immediate Action**:
- Create dedicated Search campaigns for Spain and Germany (£500-1,000/month each)
- Test smaller budgets (£200-300/month) for Hungary, Latvia, Iceland

**Expected Outcome**: 2-3x enrollment growth in these markets with 1,500-5,000% ROAS

### 2. Middle East/GCC Still Strong (But Opportunities to Optimize)

**Current Performance**:
| Country | Spend | Enrollments | ROAS | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------|------|--------|

**Recommendation**:
- **Maintain or increase**: UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman
- **Optimize UK campaigns**: 292% ROAS is below target (aim for 500%+)

### 3. Expansion Opportunities (High Enrollments, No Ads)

**Discovery**: 22 countries had enrollments in Aug-Nov but **received zero Google Ads impressions**.

**Top Expansion Markets**:
| Country | Enrollments | Revenue | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 🇳🇬 Nigeria | 3 | £10,500 | Test £300-500/month |
| 🇵🇰 Pakistan | 2 | £7,000 | Test £300-500/month |
| 🇪🇬 Egypt | 1 | £3,500 | Monitor, test if pattern continues |
| 🇮🇩 Indonesia | 1 | £3,500 | Monitor, test if pattern continues |

**Rationale**: These students found NDA through organic search, referrals, or other channels. Google Ads campaigns targeting these countries could **multiply enrollment volume** while maintaining strong ROAS.

## 📊 Data Quality & Assumptions

### What We Know
✅ **Actual enrollment data** from client spreadsheets (Aug-Nov 2025)
✅ **Google Ads performance** by country (impressions, clicks, spend, conversions)
✅ **Standardized country names** (227 variants → 141 unique countries)

### What We Assumed
⚠️ **Average course fee**: £3,500 (needs validation - does pricing vary by course/country?)
⚠️ **Attribution window**: Direct (enrollment date = Aug-Nov 2025)
⚠️ **Conversion lag**: Not accounted for (students may enroll weeks/months after ad click)

### What We Need to Validate
1. **Course pricing by country** - Do international students pay different fees?
2. **Attribution lag** - What % of Aug-Nov enrollments came from ads clicked Jul-Oct?
3. **Enrollment vs application conversion rate** - Currently assumed 15%, is this accurate?
4. **Revenue per enrollment** - Are there upsells, scholarship discounts, or multi-course enrollments?

## 💡 Key Insights for Client Meeting

### What's Working Exceptionally Well
1. **European organic reach is converting at 3,000-10,000% ROAS** when given even minimal ad spend
2. **GCC markets (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman) are solid** at 500-900% ROAS
3. **Overall profitability is strong** at 536% ROAS

### What Needs Attention
1. **UK campaigns underperforming** at 292% ROAS (expected 500%+ for mature market)
2. **Significant wasted spend** in Asia Pacific markets with zero enrollments
3. **22 expansion opportunity countries** with enrollments but no ad coverage

### What's Surprising
1. **Hungary, Latvia, Iceland outperforming** major markets despite minimal spend
2. **Oman's exceptional performance** (924% ROAS, £34 CPA) - was initially thought to have 0 conversions
3. **Nigeria and Pakistan enrollments** from organic channels suggest strong paid opportunity

---

## ⚠️ Important Caveats

1. **Attribution Lag**: Students may click an ad in July and enroll in September. This analysis uses enrollment date (Aug-Nov), not ad click date. True ROAS may be higher/lower depending on when ads were clicked.

2. **Sample Size**: Some countries (Iceland, Latvia, Hungary) have only 1-2 enrollments. While ROAS is exceptional, statistical significance is low. Test with small budgets before scaling.

3. **Course Pricing Assumptions**: £3,500 average fee may not be accurate for all courses or countries. Validate with client.

4. **Organic vs Paid**: Expansion opportunity countries (Nigeria, Pakistan) currently receive enrollments from non-paid channels. Paid campaigns may have different conversion rates.

---

## 📞 Next Steps

**Client Meeting Agenda**:
1. Review overall ROAS (536%) and top-performing countries
2. Discuss wasted spend in Asia Pacific (geo-exclusions)
3. Validate course pricing assumptions (£3,500 average)
4. Approve Phase 1 budget reallocation (£616 freed → reallocate to Europe)
5. Approve Phase 2 expansion tests (Spain, Germany, Nigeria, Pakistan)
6. Set expectations for UK campaign optimization (target 500% ROAS)

**Questions for Client**:
- Does course pricing vary by country or program?
- What is typical lag between ad click and enrollment?
- Are there seasonal enrollment patterns we should account for?
- Which markets are strategic priorities beyond ROAS (e.g., brand building)?
