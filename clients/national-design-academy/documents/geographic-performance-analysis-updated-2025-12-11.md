## Data Limitations & Next Steps

### Current Analysis Gaps
⚠️ **Missing Google Ads ROAS Correlation**
- Enrollment data current (Dec 8)
- Google Ads spend data needs updating
- Next step: Pull current Google Ads campaign data by country

⚠️ **Attribution Lag**
- Enrollment date ≠ Ad click date (2-4 week lag)
- Current enrollments likely from October-November ads
- Full December impact won't show until early January

### Required Follow-up (Week of Dec 15)

1. **Pull Google Ads Data by Country** (Last 60 days)
   - Spend by country/campaign
   - Conversions by country (if available)
   - Click/impression metrics

2. **Calculate Updated ROAS**
   - Match enrollment countries to Google Ads countries
   - Calculate provisional ROAS (Dec 11 enrollments / Oct-Nov spend)
   - Note: Will be refined once attribution window clears

3. **Generate Updated Dashboard**
   - Country performance grid (volume, revenue, ads spend, ROAS)
   - Trend comparison: Oct vs Nov vs Dec
   - Visual: Top 15 countries by ROAS
