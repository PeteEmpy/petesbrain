## Budget Increase Strategy

### Assumption: £X Increase Starting January 2026

The following recommendations are **scalable** - apply the percentage allocation to whatever budget increase Paul confirms.

### Recommended Allocation Framework

| Priority | Markets | % of Increase | Rationale |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Priority 1** | UK + Europe | **60%** | Most efficient markets (£35-£113 CPA), proven volume delivery |
| **Priority 2** | ROTW + India | **25%** | Strong efficiency (£98-£131 CPA), growth potential |
| **Priority 3** | Strategic Testing | **15%** | Optimised UAE/US campaigns after restructuring |

### Example: £5,000/month Increase

| Market | Current Daily | Increase | New Daily | New Monthly |
|--------|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **UK - PMax Degree** | £20/day | +£60/day | £80/day | £2,400/month |
| **UK - Search Diploma** | £140/day | +£50/day | £190/day | £5,700/month |
| **UK - Brand Search** | £110/day | +£20/day | £130/day | £3,900/month |
| **Europe - Search Degree** | £16.69/day | +£40/day | £56.69/day | £1,700/month |
| **ROTW - PMax Diploma** | £30/day | +£30/day | £60/day | £1,800/month |
| **ROTW - PMax Degree** | £20/day | +£20/day | £40/day | £1,200/month |
| **India - PMax** | £27/day | +£20/day | £47/day | £1,410/month |
| **India - Search Diploma** | £14.18/day | +£10/day | £24.18/day | £725/month |
| **Strategic Testing Pool** | - | +£25/day | £25/day | £750/month |

**Expected Impact (£5K increase example):**
- **Current:** £124,261 (Sept-Dec) ≈ £36,400/month → 762 conv (≈223/month) @ £163 CPA
- **Post-Increase:** £41,400/month → Est. **280-310 conversions/month** @ **£135-145 CPA** (↓15% efficiency gain)

### Example: £10,000/month Increase

| Market | Current Daily | Increase | New Daily | New Monthly |
|--------|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **UK - PMax Degree** | £20/day | +£120/day | £140/day | £4,200/month |
| **UK - Search Diploma** | £140/day | +£100/day | £240/day | £7,200/month |
| **UK - Brand Search** | £110/day | +£40/day | £150/day | £4,500/month |
| **Europe - Search Degree** | £16.69/day | +£80/day | £96.69/day | £2,900/month |
| **ROTW - PMax Diploma** | £30/day | +£60/day | £90/day | £2,700/month |
| **ROTW - PMax Degree** | £20/day | +£40/day | £60/day | £1,800/month |
| **India - PMax** | £27/day | +£40/day | £67/day | £2,010/month |
| **India - Search Diploma** | £14.18/day | +£20/day | £34.18/day | £1,025/month |
| **Strategic Testing Pool** | - | +£50/day | £50/day | £1,500/month |

**Expected Impact (£10K increase example):**
- **Post-Increase:** £46,400/month → Est. **330-370 conversions/month** @ **£125-140 CPA** (↓20% efficiency gain)

---

## Priority Actions Before Budget Increase

### Immediate (Week 1-2 - Before Budget Increase)

1. ✅ **Scale Top 3 Performers**
   - UK PMax Degree: £20 → £40-80/day (£36 CPA = aggressive scaling justified)
   - Europe Search Degree: £16.69 → £40-80/day (£60 CPA = untapped gold)
   - ROTW PMax Degree: £20 → £40/day (£80 CPA = strong efficiency)

2. 🔴 **Pause/Restructure GCC Campaigns**
   - **Problem:** £14,801 spend, 15.62 conv, £947 CPA (5.8x account average)
   - **Action:** Pause zero-conversion campaigns immediately (save £3,640/month):
     - "Interior Design Degree - Oman/Saudi/Bahrain/Kuwait" (£2,165 spent, 0 conv)
     - "PMax Reboot Diploma - GCC" (£1,310 spent, 0 conv)
     - "PMax Degree - GCC" (£1,135 spent, 0 conv)
   - **Free up budget:** £3.64K/month to reallocate to efficient markets

3. ⚠️ **Optimise UAE Campaigns**
   - **Current:** £20,311 spend, 48.54 conv, £418 CPA
   - **Target:** Reduce CPA to £250-300 range before scaling
   - **Actions:**
     - Review search term waste (high CPC, low intent terms)
     - Tighten audience targeting on PMax
     - Add negative keywords from zero-conversion queries

4. ⚠️ **Optimise US/Canada**
   - **Current:** £8,428 spend, 20.80 conv, £405 CPA
   - **Target:** Reduce CPA to £250-300 range before scaling
   - **Actions:**
     - Review PMax Diploma (£1,525 spent, 1 conv = £1,525 CPA) - consider pausing
     - Focus budget on Search campaigns (better performance)

### Medium-Term (Weeks 3-4)

5. **Launch New Europe Campaigns**
   - Current Europe coverage is minimal (£2,690 total, only 2.2% of spend)
   - **Opportunity:** Expand beyond current 6 countries
   - **Suggested:** Add Belgium, Italy, Spain, Switzerland campaigns (proven ROAS from geographic analysis)

6. **India Market Expansion**
   - Current India: £7,394 spend, 46.87 conv, £158 CPA (reasonable)
   - **Action:** Scale India PMax (£98 CPA) and Search (£304 CPA - needs optimisation)
   - **Target:** Double India budget from £7.4K → £15K/month (still only 12% of account)

7. **ROTW Diversification**
   - Current ROTW delivers 12% of conversions at £131 CPA (efficient)
   - **Opportunity:** Break out top-performing countries into dedicated campaigns
   - **From Geographic Analysis:** Nigeria (3 enrollments, £0 spend), Pakistan (2 enrollments, £0 spend)

## Risk Mitigation

### Market Saturation Risks

| Market | Current Scale | Saturation Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| UK | £57.9K (107 days) | **Low-Medium** | Largest market, proven volume capacity |
| Europe | £2.7K (107 days) | **Very Low** | Massively under-tapped (only 2.2% of spend) |
| ROTW | £12.1K (107 days) | **Low** | Broad market, diversification opportunities |
| India | £7.4K (107 days) | **Low** | Growth market, competitive but scalable |

### Performance Monitoring Framework

**Weekly Reviews (First 4 weeks):**
- CPA by market vs. baseline (alert if >20% increase)
- Conversion volume trends (alert if not scaling proportionally)
- Click volume and impression share (auction competitiveness)

**Adjustment Triggers:**
- **CPA increases >25%** in any market → reduce budget 30% immediately
- **Zero conversions for 7 days** in scaled campaign → pause and investigate
- **Impression share loss >10pp** → review auction competition and bid strategy

## Campaign-Specific Recommendations

### 🚀 Aggressive Scaling (Top Priority)

1. **NDA | P Max | Interior Design Degree - UK** (£36 CPA)
   - Current: £20/day | Scale to: **£60-100/day**
   - Rationale: Lowest CPA in account, 155 conversions over 107 days = proven volume

2. **NDA | Search | Interior Design Degree - Europe** (£60 CPA)
   - Current: £16.69/day | Scale to: **£60-100/day**
   - Rationale: 2nd lowest CPA, massively under-invested market

3. **NDA | P Max | Interior Design Degree - ROTW** (£80 CPA)
   - Current: £20/day | Scale to: **£40-60/day**
   - Rationale: 3rd best CPA, efficient international reach

### ✅ Moderate Scaling

4. **NDA | UK | Search | Brand** (£62 CPA)
   - Current: £110/day | Scale to: **£130-150/day**
   - Rationale: Strong brand performance, high intent traffic

5. **NDA | P Max | Interior Design - India** (£98 CPA)
   - Current: £27/day | Scale to: **£50-70/day**
   - Rationale: Best India performer, below account average CPA

6. **NDA | UK | Search | Interior Design Diploma** (£110 CPA)
   - Current: £140/day | Scale to: **£180-220/day**
   - Rationale: Largest volume driver (266 conv), Ai Max performing well

7. **NDA | P Max Reboot | Interior Design Diploma - ROTW** (£116 CPA)
   - Current: £30/day | Scale to: **£50-70/day**
   - Rationale: Strong volume (50 conv), efficient international reach

### ⚠️ Optimise Before Scaling

8. **NDA | Search | Interior Design Degree - UK** (£224 CPA)
   - Current: £42.64/day | Action: **Review search terms, tighten targeting**
   - Issue: 2x account average CPA despite UK market efficiency

9. **NDA | Search | Interior Design Diploma - India** (£304 CPA)
   - Current: £14.18/day | Action: **Audit keywords, review match types**
   - Issue: Nearly 2x more expensive than India PMax (£98 CPA)

### 🔴 Pause/Restructure (Critical Issues)

10. **All GCC Zero-Conversion Campaigns**
    - Pause immediately: 3 campaigns, £3,640/month wasted spend
    - Restructure remaining GCC campaigns (£947 avg CPA unacceptable)

11. **NDA | P Max | Interior Design Diploma - USA/Canada** (£1,525 CPA)
    - Current: £4.94/day | Action: **Pause immediately**
    - Issue: 1 conversion from £1,525 spend = severe underperformance

---

## Questions for Paul

1. **Budget Increase Quantum:** What is the confirmed monthly budget increase for January?

2. **Geographic Priorities:** Are there specific markets Paul wants to prioritise beyond efficiency data? (e.g., strategic India push vs UK consolidation)

3. **GCC Market Strategy:**
   - Is there a strategic reason to maintain GCC presence despite poor performance?
   - Or are we free to pause underperforming GCC campaigns and redirect budget?

4. **US/Canada Market:**
   - Is US market strategically important long-term?
   - Willing to accept higher CPA for market entry, or prefer to wait until optimised?

5. **Europe Expansion:**
   - Appetite for aggressive Europe scaling given exceptional £60 CPA?
   - Any country preferences or restrictions?

6. **Conversion Value Tracking:**
   - Are we capturing accurate conversion values (student revenue)?
   - Current data shows £22,892 value from UK (266 conv) = £86/conv, but courses are £895-£1,500
   - Need to verify Enhanced Conversions value tracking

7. **Application Quality:**
   - Any feedback on lead quality by market?
   - Are certain geographies converting applications → enrollments better than others?

## Recommended Approach for Meeting

### 1. Start with Wins
- "UK is performing exceptionally well - £113 CPA, 67% of all conversions"
- "We've discovered Europe is massively under-utilised - £60 CPA, best in the account"
- "ROTW is punching above its weight - 12% of conversions from only 10% of spend"

### 2. Highlight Opportunity
- "With the budget increase, we can scale what's working efficiently"
- "Priority is UK + Europe (60% of increase) - proven low CPA markets"
- "We can grow volume without sacrificing efficiency - targeting £125-145 CPA overall"

### 3. Address Problems
- "GCC requires urgent attention - £947 CPA, can free up £3.6K/month by pausing zero-conversion campaigns"
- "UAE and US/Canada need optimisation before major scaling - 2.5-2.6x account average CPA"

### 4. Present Framework
- Show the 60/25/15 allocation framework (adaptable to any increase amount)
- Demonstrate expected outcomes by scenario (£3K, £5K, £10K increase examples)
- Emphasise monitoring and adjustment plan (weekly reviews, trigger points)

### 5. Get Buy-In
- Confirm budget quantum
- Align on geographic priorities
- Agree on GCC pause/restructure plan
- Set expectations for first 30 days (scaling period)
