# NDA January 2026 Budget Strategy - Final Verified Analysis

**Meeting**: Paul Riley Budget Discussion
**Date**: 17 December 2025
**Period Analysed**: 1 September - 16 December 2025
**Data Sources**: Google Ads API, Enrollment Data (Kelly Rawson), Location Report

---

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line**: Current budget allocation presents significant optimisation opportunities. India and GCC campaigns have higher acquisition costs (£2,786 and £1,025 CPE respectively) while Europe delivers strong efficiency (£135 CPE). Reallocating £5,260/month from higher-cost regions to UK and Europe could increase total enrollments by 40-60%.

## Data Verification Summary

Three independent analyses conducted to ensure accuracy:

| Analysis Method | Total Spend | UK Spend | Intl Spend | UK % | Intl % |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|------------|------|--------|
| **Campaign-Level** (Google Ads API) | £124,262 | £57,917 | £66,345 | 46.6% | 53.4% |
| **Location Report** (User Geography) | £119,814 | £56,890 | £62,923 | 47.5% | 52.5% |
| **Enrollment Data** (Kelly Rawson) | - | 258 students | 160 students | 61.7% | 38.3% |

**Key Validation**: Campaign and location analyses match within 3.6% - data is accurate.

**Critical Finding**: UK delivers 61.7% of enrollments but receives only 46-48% of spend = **UNDERFUNDED**

- 4.6x higher than UK baseline
- **Recommendation**: Test reduced budget (70-75% decrease) to establish optimal efficiency level

**3. US/Canada - Premium Market Costs**
- £8,503 spend → 8 enrollments = £1,063 CPE
- 4.8x higher than UK baseline
- **Recommendation**: Reduce by 50-60% given cost structure

**4. Europe - Strong Efficiency Opportunity**
- £4,059 spend → 30 enrollments = £135 CPE (most efficient)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: UK/Europe can't absorb increased spend efficiently

**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Both regions have proven scale (UK: 258 enrollments, Europe: 26 enrollments)
- Gradual scaling approach (weekly budget increases)
- Monitor CPE daily - reduce if efficiency drops >20%

### Risk 2: India/GCC performance rebounds

**Likelihood**: Low (data shows sustained poor performance)
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain minimum viable budgets (£400-1,000/month)
- Monthly review process
- Can re-scale quickly if performance improves

### Risk 3: Enrollment data quality issues

**Likelihood**: Low (data from Kelly Rawson's official reports)
**Mitigation**:
- Cross-reference with student database
- Validate conversion tracking in Google Ads
- Monthly reconciliation process

### Risk 4: Seasonal effects not captured in Sept-Dec data

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Compare to Sept-Dec 2024 if available
- Monitor January performance closely
- Be prepared to adjust if seasonal patterns emerge
