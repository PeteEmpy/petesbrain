## Daily Monitoring (Next 7 Days)

### Day 1-2 Checks (Critical Window - November 11-12)

**Engineering Search UK** - Check every 6 hours if possible:

**Hour 6 (6pm Nov 10)**:
- [ ] Check CPC - has it started dropping from £947?
- [ ] Check impressions - still getting traffic?
- [ ] Check spend - is it still spending budget?

**Hour 24 (10am Nov 11)**:
- [ ] CPC should be £400-600 (50% drop from £947)
- [ ] Conversions: Should have 1-2 in last 24hrs (normal rate)
- [ ] If CPC still £900+ → Check Target CPA saved correctly

**Hour 48 (10am Nov 12)**:
- [ ] CPC should be £150-250 (target stabilized)
- [ ] Conversions: Should have 2-3 in last 48hrs
- [ ] Spend: Should be using 80-100% of daily budget

**ROW Engineering** - Check daily:

**Day 1 (Nov 11)**:
- [ ] Check if budget increased to £40/day saved
- [ ] Check spend - should be higher than previous £10/day
- [ ] Check CPC - should stay £50-100 range
- [ ] Check conversions - should be getting 1-2/day (vs 0.33/day previously)

**Day 2 (Nov 12)**:

- [ ] Total conversions - should be 2-3 (vs 0.66 previously)

---

### Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **Engineering Search UK - If CPC NOT dropping**:
- Check campaign settings - is Target CPA actually enabled?
- Check campaign status - is it still active?
- Check if budget changed - should still be £100/day
- If CPC still £900+ after 48 hours → Contact me for troubleshooting

🚩 **ROW Engineering - If CPA spikes above £80**:
- Algorithm may be struggling with 4x budget increase
- Action: Reduce budget to £20/day for 24 hours, then increase to £30/day
- Monitor for another 48 hours before scaling further

🚩 **Either campaign - Zero conversions for 24+ hours**:
- Check conversion tracking - possible technical issue
- Check search terms - are ads still showing?
- Check bid strategy status - any warnings/errors?

🚩 **Either campaign - "Limited by bid strategy" message**:
- Target CPA is set too low
- Engineering UK: Increase from £100 to £120
- ROW Engineering: Increase from £50 to £60
- Monitor for 48 hours

## Next Steps After Week 1 Review

   - Exclude job boards and employment categories

2. ✅ Reactivate Management Search UK
   - Add Target CPA: £150

   - If CPA £50-60 → Hold at £40/day for another week

### If Partial Success (Some improvement but not target):

**Troubleshooting**:
1. Review search terms - any wasted spend?
2. Check Quality Scores - any improvements needed?
3. Consider adjusting Target CPAs:
   - Engineering UK: Try £120 if getting limited impressions
   - ROW Engineering: Try £60 if CPA above £70

### If Failed (No improvement or worse):

**Emergency Actions**:
1. Screenshot all settings before reverting
2. Contact Google Ads support - possible account issue
