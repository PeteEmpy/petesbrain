# NDA International Students - October Comparison

**Date:** November 3, 2025
**Comparison:** October 2024 vs October 2025
**Scope:** International students only

---

## Executive Summary

International enrollment volume grew **163.2%** (+31 students) with significantly improved cost efficiency (-30.7% cost per enrollment). However, **revenue per enrollment declined 59.2%**, causing ROAS to drop from 975% to 574% (-401pp). Marketing is performing excellently at acquiring students, but each student is generating substantially less revenue.

## Analysis

### ✅ What's Working Well

**1. Marketing Efficiency**
- Cost per enrollment improved 30.7% (£642 → £445)
- Enrollments grew 163.2% while spend increased only 82.4%
- Demonstrating strong campaign optimisation and audience targeting

**2. Volume Growth**
- Added 31 international enrollments in October alone
- 50 enrollments represents strong month-on-month performance

- Mirrors YTD trend (-65.8% overall revenue per enrollment)

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. **Course Mix Shift** - More students enrolling in lower-priced courses
2. **Payment Plans** - Increased use of instalments (revenue recognised over time)
3. **Promotional Activity** - Discounts to drive volume
4. **Attribution Timing** - Revenue lag between enrollment and payment collection

**2. ROAS Decline**
- Dropped 401 percentage points (975% → 574%)
- Revenue growth (7.4%) not keeping pace with enrollment growth (163.2%)

## Root Cause Investigation

### Why Did Revenue Per Enrollment Drop So Dramatically?

**Evidence Required from Client:**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Request Course Breakdown from Paul**
   - October 2025 international enrollments by course type
   - October 2024 international enrollments by course type (for comparison)
   - Average course fee and payment method distribution

2. **Geographic Performance Analysis**
   - Break down October enrollments by country
   - Calculate revenue per enrollment by geography
   - Identify if certain markets are driving the revenue decline

3. **Payment Timeline Review**
   - Understand revenue recognition policy for international students
   - Check if October revenue figure includes all installment payments
   - Determine if revenue/enrollment metric is accurate for comparison

### Short-Term Optimisations (Weeks 2-4)

4. **Campaign Segmentation by Value**
   - Identify which campaigns drive higher-value students
   - Increase spend on high-ROAS, high-value campaigns
   - Reduce spend on volume-focused, low-value campaigns

5. **Geographic Budget Reallocation**
   - UAE campaigns appear strong (high spend = likely high performance)
   - Consider increasing budget for proven high-value markets
   - Test reducing budget in lower-value markets

6. **Course-Specific Targeting**
   - If diploma students are lower-value, shift focus to degree programs
   - Create separate campaigns for higher-value courses
   - Test messaging that attracts full-pay students

### Long-Term Strategy (Months 2-3)

7. **Value Optimisation**
   - Promote higher-value courses to international markets
   - Bundle courses or upsell during enrollment process
   - Implement minimum ROAS targets by campaign

8. **Payment Optimisation**
   - Incentivise full payment upfront (discount for full payment)
   - Improve installment plan visibility in revenue reporting
   - Track lifetime value beyond initial enrollment revenue

9. **Market Maturity Assessment**
   - Determine if revenue decline is strategic (building brand, market share)
   - Or if it's unintentional (competitive pressure, poor targeting)
   - Adjust strategy based on long-term business goals

## Data Quality Notes

### Assumptions Made

1. **October 2024 Enrollments (Estimated)**
   - Based on YTD 2024-25 proportion (41.3% international)
   - Applied to estimated total October 2024 enrollments (~45 total)
   - Result: 19 international students (estimated)

2. **Revenue Split by Geography**
   - October 2024: Applied YTD 2024-25 international % (39%)
   - October 2025: Applied YTD 2025-26 international % (51%)
   - Assumes proportional revenue distribution throughout the year

3. **Google Ads Spend Allocation**
   - Classified campaigns as UK or International based on campaign names
   - International includes: UAE, MENA, India, ROTW, Europe, USA/Canada
   - UK excludes any campaign with "| UK |" or "- UK " in the name

### Data Limitations

1. **Historical Enrollment Data**
   - Enrollment spreadsheets only contain Aug 2025 onwards
   - October 2024 enrollment count is estimated, not actual
   - Could affect accuracy of year-on-year comparison

2. **Revenue Attribution**
   - "Dubai Income" represents ALL international students (not just UAE)
   - Revenue may be recognised differently than enrollment timing
   - Installment plans create potential mismatch between enrollment and revenue dates

3. **Geographic Revenue Split**
   - Used YTD proportions to estimate October-specific international revenue
   - Actual October split may differ from YTD average
   - Seasonality or promotional activity could skew October specifically

   - What was the average course fee in October 2024 vs. October 2025?

4. **Payment Methods:**
   - What % of October international students paid in full vs. instalments?
   - Is revenue recognised at enrollment or over the course duration?

5. **Strategic Context:**
   - Were there any promotions or discounts running in October 2025?
   - Have you changed international pricing or course offerings this year?
   - Is the focus on volume growth (enrollments) or value growth (revenue)?
