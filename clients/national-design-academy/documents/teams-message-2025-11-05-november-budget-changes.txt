Hi [Client Name],

Quick heads up - I'm implementing the November budget changes today to return the account to August baseline levels (reducing spend from £40k to £24k/month).

Top performers stay at current budgets, underperformers reduced significantly, and zero-conversion campaigns dropped to minimal test levels. UAE campaigns excluded for now - we can discuss those separately.

Full details in the email I've just sent over.
