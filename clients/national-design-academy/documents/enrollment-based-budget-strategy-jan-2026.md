### 🚀 **High-Value Opportunities (Enrollments with ZERO or minimal spend):**

| Country | Enrollments | Current Spend | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Hungary** | 3 | £0 | Add to Europe campaigns |
| **Singapore** | 3 | £0 | Launch APAC test campaign |
| **Lebanon** | 2 | £0 | Add to ROTW |
| **Mauritius** | 2 | £0 | Add to ROTW |
| **Nigeria** | 2 | £0 | Add to ROTW/Africa |
| **Austria** | 3 | £2,690 (shared Europe) | Already covered but could scale |
| **France** | 2 | £2,690 (shared Europe) | Already covered but could scale |

### 🔴 **Critical Problem: India Market**

**Enrollment Reality:**
- **2 enrollments** from £7,394 spend = £3,697 per enrollment
- **1.2%** of international enrollments despite **11.1%** of international spend
- Cost per enrollment is **11.9x** higher than Europe, **15x** higher than ROTW

**Campaign Performance (Sept-Dec):**
- India PMax: £3,766 spend, 38.23 Google Ads conversions, BUT only 2 actual enrollments
- India Search: £2,384 spend, 7.84 Google Ads conversions, negligible enrollments

**Google Ads "Conversions" ≠ Enrollments:**
- India showing 46 Google Ads conversions
- Only 2 actual enrolled students
- **Conversion → Enrollment rate: 4.3%** (vs likely 15-20% for UK/Europe)
- Suggests low-quality leads or misaligned targeting

## 📋 **JANUARY BUDGET INCREASE PLAN (Enrollment-Based)**

### Example: £5,000/month Increase (Enrollment ROI Framework)

**Allocation Principle:** Fund regions proportional to enrollment delivery AND efficiency

| Region | Current Monthly | % of Total | New Allocation | Monthly Increase | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **UK** | £16,947 | 46.6% | **£25,470** | **+£8,523 (+50%)** | 61.7% enrollments, best CPE |
| **Europe** | £787 | 2.2% | **£4,098** | **+£3,311 (+421%)** | Massively undertapped, £103 CPE |
| **UAE** | £5,944 | 16.3% | **£6,538** | **+£594 (+10%)** | Maintain share, solid performer |
| **ROTW** | £3,527 | 9.7% | **£4,920** | **+£1,393 (+40%)** | Scale efficient market |
| **India** | £2,164 | 5.9% | **£820** | **-£1,344 (-62%)** | 🔴 **REDUCE** - Poor enrollment ROI |
| **US/Canada** | £2,467 | 6.8% | **£1,230** | **-£1,237 (-50%)** | ⚠️ Reduce to test budget |
| **GCC** | £4,331 | 11.9% | **£1,230** | **-£3,101 (-72%)** | 🔴 **RESTRUCTURE** - Pause failures |
| **Total** | £36,167 | 100% | **£44,306** | **+£8,139** | Net after cuts |
| **With Increase** | - | - | **£41,167** | **+£5,000** | After reallocation |

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Enrollments:** 418 (Sept-Dec) → Projected **520-560/period** (+24-34%)
- **UK CPE:** £224 → Target **£210-220** (modest efficiency gain from scale)
- **International CPE:** £415 → Target **£290-320** (30% improvement via Europe scaling)
- **Overall CPE:** £297 → Target **£265-285** (10-12% improvement)

---

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### Week 1 (Before Budget Increase)

1. 🔴 **PAUSE India Campaigns Immediately**
   - **Current:** £7,394/period for 2 enrollments = £3,697 CPE
   - **Action:** Reduce India PMax from £27/day → £5/day (-82%)
   - **Action:** Pause India Search (£14.18/day, no enrollment delivery)
   - **Savings:** £20/day (£600/month) → Redirect to Europe/UK
   - **Rationale:** Worst enrollment ROI in account (11.9x worse than Europe)

2. 🔴 **Restructure GCC Campaigns (£1,480 CPE)**
   - **Pause Zero-Enrollment Campaigns:**
     - "Interior Design Degree - GCC" Search (£2,166 spent, 0 enrollments)
     - "P Max Reboot Diploma - GCC" (£1,310 spent, 0 enrollments)
     - "P Max Degree - GCC" (£1,135 spent, 0 enrollments)
   - **Savings:** £3,640/month → Redirect to Europe/UK/ROTW
   - **Retain:** Only campaigns showing actual enrollment delivery

3. ⚠️ **Reduce US/Canada to Test Budget**
   - **Current:** £8,428 for 8 enrollments = £1,054 CPE
   - **Action:** Reduce US/Canada PMax from £4.94/day → £2/day
   - **Action:** Maintain US/Canada Search at current level (better performer)
   - **Savings:** £90/month → Redirect to Europe

4. 🚀 **Scale Europe Aggressively**
   - **Current:** £2,690 for 26 enrollments = £103 CPE (BEST IN ACCOUNT)
   - **Action:** Scale Europe Search Degree from £16.69/day → £60/day (+260%)
   - **Action:** Launch new Europe PMax campaign (£30-40/day)
   - **Investment:** +£3,300/month
   - **Expected:** 26 enrollments → 80-90 enrollments (+208%)

### Weeks 2-4 (Post-Budget Increase Implementation)

5. **UK Scaling Plan**
   - Priority 1: UK PMax Degree (£35.73 CPE) - Scale from £20 → £80/day
   - Priority 2: UK Search Diploma (£110.48 CPE) - Scale from £140 → £220/day
   - Priority 3: UK Brand Search (£62.49 CPE) - Scale from £110 → £150/day

6. **ROTW Expansion**
   - Add Hungary to Europe campaigns (3 enrollments, £0 current spend)
   - Add Singapore to APAC test (3 enrollments, £0 current spend)
   - Scale existing ROTW PMax (£116 CPE) from £30 → £60/day

## 📊 **ENROLLMENT VS GOOGLE ADS CONVERSION DISCREPANCY**

### Critical Learning: Google Ads "Conversions" ≠ Enrolled Students

| Market | Google Ads Conv. | Actual Enrollments | Enrollment Rate | Quality Gap |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **UK** | 511 | 258 | **50.5%** | ✅ Good quality |
| **UAE** | 49 | 65 | **133%** | ✅ Under-tracking? |
| **ROTW** | 92 | 49 | **53.3%** | ✅ Good quality |
| **Europe** | 28 | 26 | **92.9%** | ✅ Excellent quality |
| **India** | 46 | **2** | **4.3%** | 🔴🔴 Poor quality |
| **GCC** | 16 | 10 | **62.5%** | ⚠️ Below average |
| **US/Canada** | 21 | 8 | **38.1%** | ⚠️ Poor quality |

**Key Insights:**
1. **UK, Europe, ROTW:** Google Ads conversions correlate well with enrollments (50-90% rate)
2. **UAE:** More enrollments than Google Ads conversions (likely tracking issue or offline conversions not captured)
3. **India:** MASSIVE quality issue - 46 Google Ads conversions but only 2 actual students (4.3% enrollment rate)
4. **US/Canada:** Poor quality - 21 conversions but only 8 enrollments (38% rate)

**India Market Diagnosis:**
- Application form submissions (Google Ads "conversions") are not translating to actual enrollments
- Possible causes:
  - Low-intent traffic (browsing vs serious applicants)
  - Price sensitivity (UK pricing too high for Indian market expectations)
  - Competition from local free/low-cost alternatives (Mind Luster, Swayam Portal)
  - Qualification mismatches (applicants don't meet course requirements)

**Recommendation:** India requires fundamental strategic rethink, not just budget optimisation

## 🗣️ **MEETING TALKING POINTS FOR PAUL**

### 1. **Lead with Enrollment Data (Not Google Ads Conversions)**

**Opening:**
> "Paul, I've analysed the actual enrollment data from Kelly's weekly reports against our ad spend. The results are revealing—we have some significant misalignments that represent immediate opportunities."

**Key Stats:**
- 418 total enrollments (Sept-Dec)
- UK: 258 (61.7%), but only 46.6% of ad spend
- International: 160 (38.3%), but getting 53.4% of ad spend

### 2. **Highlight Europe Opportunity**

**Message:**
> "Europe is performing exceptionally—£103 cost per enrollment, which is half the UK rate and 4x better than our international average. But we're only allocating 2.2% of budget there. With 26 enrollments from minimal spend, there's massive untapped potential."

**Recommendation:**
- Scale Europe from £787/month → £4,000-6,000/month
- Expected: 26 enrollments → 80-120 enrollments

### 3. **Address India Problem Directly**

**Message:**
> "India is our biggest concern. We've spent £7,394 and enrolled just 2 students—that's £3,697 per enrollment, which is 16x worse than Europe and 12x worse than ROTW. Google Ads shows 46 conversions, but only 2 became actual students. The lead quality issue is severe."

**Recommendation:**
- Reduce India budget by 80% (-£1,750/month)
- Redirect savings to Europe and UK
- Reassess India strategy in Q2 (different pricing model? Local partnerships?)

### 4. **Propose Enrollment-Based Reallocation**

**Framework:**
> "I propose we reallocate budget based on actual enrollment outcomes, not Google Ads metrics. This means funding markets proportional to their enrollment delivery AND efficiency."

**Budget Shifts:**
- UK: +8-13pp (from 46.6% → 55-60%)
- Europe: +6-8pp (from 2.2% → 8-10%)
- India: -5pp (from 5.9% → <1%)
- GCC: -9pp (from 11.9% → 2-3%)

### 5. **Set Clear Success Metrics**

**Propose New KPI:**
> "Moving forward, our primary KPI should be **Cost per Enrollment**, not Cost per Google Ads Conversion. Current overall CPE is £297. Target: £240-265 after reallocation."

**Monthly Targets (post-reallocation):**
- Enrollments: 122/month → 155-230/month (+27-89%)
- UK CPE: £224 → £210-220
- International CPE: £415 → £290-320
- Overall CPE: £297 → £240-280
