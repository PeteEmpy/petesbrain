### ⚠️ Opportunity Gaps (High Ads Activity, Low/No Conversions)

Countries receiving significant impressions but showing poor conversion performance:

| Country | Impressions | Spend (£) | Conversions | Issue |

| 🇴🇲 Oman | 1,007,842 | £1,121 | **0** | Zero conversions despite 1M impressions |

- **Europe (Germany, Italy):** Consider geo-exclusion if campaigns not tailored for these markets
- **China/Japan:** Low spend suggests incidental reach - exclude or create dedicated campaigns

### 🎯 Expansion Opportunities (High Enrollments, Low/No Ads Activity)

Countries with strong enrollment history but minimal Google Ads presence:

**Potential High-ROI Markets** (based on enrollment data, need Google Ads coverage analysis):
- **Nigeria** - Major enrollment source, needs dedicated campaigns
- **Egypt** - Frequent enrollment country, low Google Ads visibility
- **Pakistan** - Large English-speaking market with design education demand
- **Bangladesh** - Similar to Pakistan, growing market
- **Philippines** - High English proficiency, design interest
- **Australia** - Premium market with UK credential appreciation
- **New Zealand** - Similar to Australia
- **Ireland** - Only 14.7K impressions despite enrollment history

**Recommendation:** Cross-reference enrollment revenue by country to prioritize expansion markets.

## Next Steps: Data Correlation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Preparation (Week 1)
1. **Standardize enrollment country data:**
   - Create country mapping table (e.g., "Dubai" → "United Arab Emirates")
   - Consolidate city names to country level
   - Fix spelling variations

2. **Export Google Ads data by country:**
   - Monthly impressions, clicks, spend, conversions (Aug-Nov 2025)
   - Segmented by campaign type (India PMax, Search, UK campaigns)

3. **Create enrollment revenue data:**
   - Count enrollments by country (Aug-Nov 2025)
   - Calculate revenue per enrollment by country (if course fees vary)
   - Calculate lifetime value estimates by country

---

### Phase 2: Correlation Analysis (Week 2)
Create combined dataset with these fields:

| Country | Ads Impressions | Ads Spend | Ads Conversions | Enrollments | Revenue | ROAS | CPA |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------|------|-----|
| India | 13.4M | £8,475 | 26.8 | [from enrollment data] | [calculated] | [calculated] | £316 |
| UK | 1.4M | £46,610 | 396.7 | [from enrollment data] | [calculated] | [calculated] | £117 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Analysis Questions:**
1. Which countries have best ROAS (enrollment revenue vs Google Ads spend)?
2. Which countries have lowest CPA (cost per actual enrollment)?
3. Which countries show high impressions but low enrollments (targeting issue)?
4. Which countries show high enrollments but low impressions (expansion opportunity)?

---

### Phase 3: Campaign Strategy Recommendations (Week 3)

**Outputs:**
1. **Prioritized expansion list** - Top 10 countries for new/increased Google Ads spend
2. **Geo-exclusion list** - Countries with poor performance to exclude from broad campaigns
3. **Budget reallocation plan** - Shift budget from low-ROAS to high-ROAS countries
4. **Campaign structure recommendations:**
   - Dedicated campaigns for top 5 countries (beyond India/UK)
   - Shared campaigns for similar regions (e.g., GCC bundle, Europe bundle)
   - Geo-exclusions for bottom performers
