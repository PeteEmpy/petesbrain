## Key Observations & Insights

### ✅ Wins

**1. Management PMax Turnaround**
- **Before:** 1 conversion in 30 days at £917 CPA
- **After (7 days):** 3 conversions at £68.70 CPA
- **Impact:** 13x improvement in efficiency
- **Reason:** Target CPA control + better audience targeting

**2. ROW Engineering Scaling Successfully**
- **Maintaining Efficiency:** £30.46 CPA (vs £29 target)
- **Volume Increase:** On track for 30-40 conversions/month (vs 10 previously)
- **Budget Utilization:** Using only £120.81 of £280 available (7 days × £40)
- **Opportunity:** Can scale further if CPA maintains

**3. Engineering PMax Stability**
- £156.44 CPA is acceptable for engineering courses
- £0.33 CPC shows good auction efficiency
- Steady conversion flow

### 🟡 Areas of Concern

**1. Engineering Search UK - CPC Still Elevated**
- **Current:** £1.02 CPC (down from £947, but still high)
- **Expected:** Should be £0.20-0.50 range by now
- **Possible Issues:**
  - Target CPA still learning (needs 2-3 weeks)
  - Quality Score issues on key keywords
  - Competitive landscape changed
- **Action:** Continue monitoring through Nov 17, may need Target CPA adjustment to £120

**2. Management Search Campaigns Zero Conversions**
- **UK Campaign:** £295.65 spent, 0 conversions (7 days)
- **ROW Campaign:** £147.43 spent, 0 conversions (7 days)
- **Total Wasted:** £443.08 in 7 days = £1,900/month
- **Recommendation:** Consider pausing these until landing page optimization completed

### 🔴 Critical Issues

**1. Overall Conversion Volume Still Low**
- **Current:** 13.97 conversions in 7 days = ~60/month
- **Target:** 120+/month
- **Gap:** Still 50% below target
- **Root Cause:** Management campaigns not performing despite fixes

**2. Management Search High CPC, Zero Conversions**
- £1.32-1.55 CPC with no results suggests:
  - Wrong audience targeting (job seekers vs students)
  - Landing page conversion issues
  - Tracking problems
- **Immediate Action:** Pause and investigate before burning more budget

## Strategic Recommendations for Discussion

### Short-Term (Next 7 Days)

**1. Management Search Decision:**
- **Option A (Conservative):** Pause both Management Search campaigns immediately
  - Saves £1,900/month in wasted spend
  - Focus budget on proven performers
  - Revisit after landing page optimization

- **Option B (Test):** Continue for 3 more days with strict monitoring
  - If no conversions by Nov 20 → Pause automatically
  - Set daily budget alerts

**2. Engineering Search UK Adjustment:**
- Increase Target CPA from £100 to £120
- Reason: May be too restrictive, causing limited impression share
- Monitor for 7 more days

**3. ROW Engineering Scaling:**
- Current budget: £40/day (using ~£17/day actual)
- CPA maintaining at £30 (excellent)
- **Recommendation:** Hold at £40/day for another week, then scale to £60/day if CPA stays under £40

### Medium-Term (Next 4 Weeks)

**1. Management Campaign Strategy:**
- Request landing page optimization from Henry Bagshawe
- Focus on simplifying application funnel
- Add clearer CTAs matching ad messaging
- Expected impact: 0.007% → 0.3% conversion rate = 40x improvement

**2. Budget Reallocation:**
- Shift Management Search budgets (£60/day total) to proven channels:
  - ROW Engineering: +£30/day (£40 → £70)
  - Management PMax: +£20/day (£30 → £50)
  - Engineering PMax: +£10/day (£70 → £80)

**3. Quality Score Improvement:**
- Focus on Engineering Search UK keywords with QS 5 or below
- Expected CPC reduction: 20-30% = more clicks for same budget

## Questions for Paul

### NMA Performance

1. **Management Campaigns:**
   - Should we pause Management Search campaigns immediately given zero conversions?
   - Is landing page optimization feasible this month with Henry?
   - What's the priority: Fix Management campaigns or scale Engineering winners?

2. **Budget Allocation:**
   - Current total: ~£8,300/month projected
   - If we pause underperformers, can we reallocate to winners?
   - Or should we reduce overall spend until Management is fixed?

3. **Conversion Expectations:**
   - Current: ~60 conversions/month
   - Is this volume acceptable, or do we need to hit the 120/month target urgently?
   - What's the enrollment conversion rate from applications? (Helps validate tracking)

4. **Course Value for ROAS Calculations:**
   - What's the average revenue per NMA enrollment?
   - This helps us calculate true ROAS and set appropriate Target CPAs
   - Are Engineering and Management courses priced differently?

5. **Geographic Strategy:**
   - ROW Engineering performing exceptionally well (£30 CPA)
   - Should we expand to more international markets?
   - Any countries to avoid or prioritize?

6. **Landing Page Performance:**
   - Management campaigns have 0.007% conversion rate (vs 0.6% for Engineering)
   - Can we review the Management course landing pages?
   - Possible to test simplified application form or clearer CTAs?
