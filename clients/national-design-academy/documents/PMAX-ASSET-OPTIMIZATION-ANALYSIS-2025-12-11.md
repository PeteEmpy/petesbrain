## Strategic Insights

### Why Current Headlines Underperform
Analysis shows generic education copy ("Study Interior Design") significantly underperforms credibility-focused messaging:

- ❌ **Generic:** "Study Interior Design" - 0.40% CTR
- ✅ **Credible:** "National Design Academy" - 5.81% CTR
- ✅ **Benefit-focused:** "Become A Professional Interior Designer..." - 5.36% CTR

**Recommendation:** Alternatives should emphasise:
1. Professional transformation (career change angle)
2. Accreditation/recognition (AIM, KHDA, global standards)
3. Accessibility (flexible, no qualifications required)
4. Specificity (interior design explicitly, not generic "courses")

### Campaign Performance Context
- **UAE/GCC market:** Strong enrollment but fierce competition
- **ROTW (Rest of World):** Higher CTR (2.85% benchmark) suggests international audience more responsive
- **Remarketing:** Lower CTR (1.85%) suggests audience fatigue or creative fatigue
