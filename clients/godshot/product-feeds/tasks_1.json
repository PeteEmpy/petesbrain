Pull asset group performance report from Google Ads\n2. Identify conversion value and ROAS by asset group\n3. Pause asset groups with <400% ROAS\n4. Reallocate freed budget to winning asset groups (700%+ ROAS)\n5. Monitor for 7 days to verify impact\n\n**Supporting Data:**\n- Campaign: \"GOD | P Max 700\"\n- Current ROAS: 534% (blended across all asset groups)\n- Target ROAS: 700%\n- Known issues: Fellow, Rains, Coffee Generic previously flagged\n- Budget: \u00a3200/day (\u00a31,400/week)\n",

ROAS declining as spend increases.\n\n**Expected Impact:** Improve ROAS 534% \u2192 600%+ by reducing to more efficient spend level\n\n**Action:**\n1. After completing asset group optimization, reduce budget from \u00a3200/day to \u00a3180/day\n2. Monitor ROAS for 7 days\n3. If ROAS improves, hold for another 7 days\n4. Then test incremental increases (\u00a310/day steps) to find optimal budget\n5. Target: Maintain 650%+ ROAS while maximizing volume\n\n**Supporting Data:**\n- Current budget: \u00a3200/day\n- Current ROAS: 534% (spent \u00a31,401 last week)\n- Hypothesis: Algorithm spending inefficiently to hit budget target\n- Strategy: Find efficiency sweet spot before scaling\n",
