## [Godshot] Test Budget Reduction to Improve ROAS
**Completed:** 2025-12-16
**Reason:** Aggressive task audit - Test period ended

**From Weekly Report - 2025-11-18**

**Issue:** Current £200/day budget appears above optimal efficiency point. ROAS declining as spend increases.

**Expected Impact:** Improve ROAS 534% → 600%+ by reducing to more efficient spend level

**Action:**
1. After completing asset group optimization, reduce budget from £200/day to £180/day
2. Monitor ROAS for 7 days
3. If ROAS improves, hold for another 7 days
4. Then test incremental increases (£10/day steps) to find optimal budget
5. Target: Maintain 650%+ ROAS while maximizing volume

**Supporting Data:**
- Current budget: £200/day
- Current ROAS: 534% (spent £1,401 last week)
- Hypothesis: Algorithm spending inefficiently to hit budget target
- Strategy: Find efficiency sweet spot before scaling
