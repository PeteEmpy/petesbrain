## 🔴 CRITICAL PRODUCT ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### **Fellow Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2 is Burning 40% of Budget**

**The #1 spend product has terrible efficiency:**

| Product | Total Spend (14 days) | Conversions | Revenue | ROAS | Issue |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|---------|------|-------|
| **Fellow Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2** | **£209.66** | **4.33** | **£1,319** | **629%** | 🔴 **BELOW 700% TARGET** |
| All Other Products | ~£208 | 92+ | £5,331+ | ~2,500%+ | ✅ Much better efficiency |

**Daily Breakdown - Fellow Ode Grinder**:
| Date | Spend | Conversions | Revenue | ROAS |

| Oct 28 | £11.48 | 1.0 | £225 | 1,960% ✅ |

**Pattern**:
- **6 out of 11 days = ZERO conversions** (54% of days)
- When it converts: 1,200-2,000% ROAS (excellent)
- When it doesn't convert: Complete waste of budget
- **Extremely volatile performance**

**Why this matters**:
- This single product accounts for ~£15/day spend (9% of £190 budget)
- During Nov 4-7 period: **£82.35 spent, ZERO conversions** ⚠️
- This coincides with the overall ROAS drop (Nov 4-10)

## Key Findings

### 1. **Fellow Products Dominating Spend with Poor Returns**

**Total Fellow Product Spend**: £274+ (18% of total budget)
- Fellow Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2: £209.66 (629% ROAS)
- Fellow Opus & Stagg Bundle: £29.84 (0% ROAS) 🔴
- Fellow Opus Grinder: £18.28 (0% ROAS) 🔴
- Fellow Corvo EKG Pro: £6.89 (0% ROAS) 🔴
- Fellow Aiden Coffee Maker: £11.51 (2,475% ROAS) ✅

**Issue**: The Fellow asset group has **£108 spend in Nov 4-10 with ZERO conversions** (as identified in asset group analysis). This aligns with the product data showing multiple Fellow products burning budget.

---

### 2. **High-Value Fragrances with Zero Conversions**

Several luxury fragrance products are getting significant spend but not converting:

| Product | Spend | Clicks | Conversions | Issue |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Zoologist Harvest Mouse EDP 60ml | £8.49 | 1 | 0 | High CPC (£8.49), no conversion |
| Fugazzi Passionfroudh Extrait 50ml | £7.84 | 8 | 0 | Niche fragrance, low intent |
| Zoologist Rabbit EDP 60ml | £5.93 | 1 | 0 | High CPC |
| Zoologist T-Rex EDP 60ml | £5.77 | 6 | 0 | Niche brand |
| Zoologist Moth EDP 60ml | £10.59 | 10 | 0 | Interest but no conversions |

**Pattern**: Zoologist fragrances (niche, exotic scents) are attracting curiosity clicks but not converting. High price points (£60-100) may be barrier.

---

### 3. **Coffee Products with Inconsistent Performance**

| Product | Spend | Conversions | Revenue | ROAS |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------|------|
| Dak - Milky Cake 250g | £42.71 | 5.48 | £197 | **461%** ⚠️ |
| Dak - The Alchemist 250g | £8.36 | 2 | £72 | 861% ✅ |
| Dak - Panettone 250g (Christmas) | £2.25 | 0.5 | £13.25 | 589% ⚠️ |

**Issue**: Dak coffee is a top seller (per WooCommerce data in CONTEXT.md) but only achieving 461% ROAS on Google Ads - well below 700% target. This suggests:
1. Organic/direct traffic is stronger for Dak coffee than paid
2. Google Ads may be getting attribution credit when customers would have purchased anyway
3. Margins may be lower on coffee vs. equipment/fragrances

---

### 4. **Discovery Sets Performing Below Target**

| Product | Spend | Conversions | Revenue | ROAS |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------|------|
| D'Orsay Olfactory Discoveries Set | £2.98 | 0 | £0 | 0% 🔴 |
| Stora Skuggan Discovery Set 6x2ml | £3.66 | 1.5 | £311 | 8,497% ✅ |
| d'Annam Discovery Set | £16.69 | 0 | £0 | 0% 🔴 |

**Mixed performance**: Some discovery sets convert well (Stora Skuggan), others get zero conversions. This aligns with CONTEXT.md finding that customers click on discovery sets but purchase full-size products.

---

### 5. **Conversion Tracking Issues Confirmed**

Comparing top Google Ads products to WooCommerce data (from CONTEXT.md):

| Product | Google Ads Conversions (Nov 4-10) | Known WooCommerce Sales (Oct 21-28) | Match? |
|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| Fellow Ode Grinder | 0.67 conversions (Nov 4-7) | 2 units sold (Oct 21-28) | ⚠️ Timeframe mismatch |
| Dak - Milky Cake | 2.48 conversions (Nov 4-10) | 4 units sold (Oct 21-28) | ⚠️ Underattributed to Ads |
| Stora Skuggan Hexensalbe | 1 conversion (Nov 8) | 2 units sold (Oct 21-28) | ⚠️ Possible match |

**Note**: CONTEXT.md documented that only 20% of Google Ads "top converting" products matched actual WooCommerce sales (Oct 28 analysis). This issue likely persists.

---

## Root Cause Summary

The ROAS drop from 1,535% → 553% is caused by:

### **1. Fellow Ode Grinder Volatility (PRIMARY)**
- £210 spend over 14 days
- 6 out of 11 days with ZERO conversions
- When it performs well: 1,200-2,000% ROAS
- When it doesn't: Complete waste
- **Nov 4-7**: £82 spent, £0 revenue (directly caused ROAS drop)

### **2. Fellow Asset Group Waste (SECONDARY)**
- Multiple Fellow products (Opus Bundle, Corvo EKG Pro) burning budget with zero conversions
- Total Fellow spend: £274 (~18% of budget) with inconsistent returns
- Should pause underperforming Fellow products, keep only Ode Grinder and Aiden Coffee Maker

### **3. Niche Fragrance Waste (TERTIARY)**
- Zoologist fragrances attracting curiosity clicks but not converting
- High CPCs (£5-9 per click) with zero return
- Should add as negative products or reduce bid priority

### **4. Coffee Margin Issues (STRUCTURAL)**
- Dak coffee performing below 700% ROAS target (461%)
- Known to be strong organic/direct seller
- Google Ads may be cannibalizing organic traffic rather than generating incremental sales

---

## Recommended Actions

### 🔴 **IMMEDIATE (This Week)**

#### 1. **Reduce Fellow Ode Grinder Bid Priority**
**Issue**: This single product is consuming £15/day with 54% zero-conversion days.

**Action**:
- Reduce bid on product ID `17795-1` by 30-40%
- Target spend: £8-10/day instead of £15/day
- Monitor: If conversions maintain but spend drops, this improves overall ROAS

**Expected Impact**: Save £35-49/week, reallocate to better-performing products

---

#### 2. **Pause/Exclude Zero-Converting Fellow Products**
**Products to exclude**:
- Fellow Opus & Stagg Bundle (£29.84 spend, 0 conversions)
- Fellow Opus Conical Burr Grinder (£18.28 spend, 0 conversions)
- Fellow Corvo EKG Pro (£6.89 spend, 0 conversions)

**Keep Active**:
- Fellow Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2 (converts inconsistently but has strong days)
- Fellow Aiden Coffee Maker (2,475% ROAS)

**How to exclude**: Add negative product groups in Performance Max for these specific product IDs

**Expected Impact**: Save £55/week

---

#### 3. **Exclude Niche Zoologist Fragrances**
**Products to exclude**:
- Zoologist Harvest Mouse EDP 60ml (£8.49, 0 conv)
- Zoologist Rabbit EDP 60ml (£5.93, 0 conv)
- Zoologist T-Rex EDP 60ml (£5.77, 0 conv)
- Zoologist Moth EDP 60ml (£10.59, 0 conv)

**Expected Impact**: Save £30/week

---

#### 4. **Review Dak Coffee Bidding**
**Issue**: Dak - Milky Cake only achieving 461% ROAS (below 700% target)

**Questions to investigate**:
- Is Dak coffee a low-margin product? (Check with client)
- Are Google Ads customers new customers or cannibalizing organic?
- Should coffee be excluded from Performance Max and only run on brand terms?

**Action**: Reduce bid priority on coffee products by 20-30% to test if ROAS improves

---

### 🟠 **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next 7 Days)**

#### 5. **Split Fellow Products into Separate Asset Group**
**Current**: Fellow products mixed with generic products in "Generic Asset Group"

**Recommendation**: Create dedicated "Fellow Equipment" asset group with:
- Tighter bid controls
- Product-specific creative emphasizing quality/longevity
- Negative keywords for low-intent "cheap coffee grinder" searches

**Expected Impact**: Better control over Fellow spend volatility

---

#### 6. **Create "Fragrances - Discovery Sets" Asset Group**
**Current**: Discovery sets mixed with full-size fragrances

**Recommendation**: Separate asset group for discovery sets with:
- Lower cost-per-acquisition target (entry products)
- Creative emphasizing "try before you buy"
- Audience signal: previous converters, mid-funnel audiences

**Expected Impact**: Improve discovery set efficiency as customer acquisition tool

---

### 🟡 **ONGOING MONITORING**

#### 7. **Daily Product Performance Tracking**
**Setup automated monitoring for**:
- Fellow Ode Grinder: Alert if spend >£20/day with <1 conversion
- Total Fellow spend: Alert if >£40/day
- Zoologist products: Alert if any single product >£10 spend with 0 conversions

**Use**: [Product Performance Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hrr27rAc1PpVxefSLja5TlEAD4Dg1rqNxbqn4FeaYCk/)

---

#### 8. **Weekly Product Reconciliation**
**Process**:
1. Export top 20 Google Ads products by spend (last 7 days)
2. Export top 20 WooCommerce products by sales (last 7 days)
3. Compare: Match rate should be >60%
4. Flag: Products with high Ads spend but zero WooCommerce sales

**Goal**: Validate conversion tracking accuracy (CONTEXT.md notes 20% match rate issue)

---

## Expected ROAS Impact

**Further optimization** (reduce Dak coffee bids):

---

## Seasonal Considerations

**Q4 Peak Season Context**:
- Fellow Ode Grinder is a high-ticket gifting item (£225-365)
- Holiday shoppers may be researching now, buying later
- Assisted conversions may not show in current attribution

**Recommendation**:
- Keep Fellow Ode Grinder active but reduce bid 30%
- Monitor through Black Friday week (Nov 25-29)
- If performance doesn't improve by Dec 1, pause entirely and reallocate budget
