Hi Sam and Zoe,

Quick update on peak season performance (Nov 1-19):

Current numbers:
• £3,081 spent → £19,751 revenue
• 641% ROAS (£6.41 per £1)
• £162/day average spend
• 287 sales at £10.73 each

You've already scaled 5.8x from October (was £28/day) and ROAS is still strong at 641%.

Budget's hitting limits most days. With Fake Friday this Friday (22nd) and Black Friday next Friday (29th), we need overhead on the spend or we'll be limited during the biggest sales days.

Recommend increasing to at least £300/day through peak - should maintain 500%+ ROAS based on current demand.

Worth pushing to capture full Black Friday opportunity?
