## Chat Transcript

### Fellow Ads Reactivation & Google Review Request (5 Sept 2024)

**[05/09/2024, 13:46:39]** Sam Amdjadi: Hi @Zoe Godshot, Peter and I have been talking but in short, the Fellow ads are back up and running. We'll need to obtain stock on one or two lines in meantime

**[05/09/2024, 13:46:46]** Sam Amdjadi: Fellow Tally in particular

**[05/09/2024, 13:49:32]** Zoe Godshot: Ok sounds good

**[05/09/2024, 21:14:25]** Sam Amdjadi: Hi @Peter Empson any chance you could review us here? Unfortunately we had an issue in that a disgruntled young ex employee who had embarked on a campaign of negative reviews via her friends. We managed to have almost all of them removed earlier today by taking legal advice. That said, our rating which was previously 4.9 still hasn't got back to that. Long story short, we need reviews and dont' want to pester too many customers.

**[05/09/2024, 21:18:38]** Peter Empson: Ok

**[05/09/2024, 21:27:05]** Sam Amdjadi: Thanks 🙌

### Data Feed Issues - Hosting Problems (6 Sept 2024)

**[06/09/2024, 12:57:48]** Peter Empson: Do you have a contact at your hosting provider? I am constantly getting 502 gateway errors when trying to download the data feed and CHannable say we need to look in the server logs

**[06/09/2024, 13:32:34]** Sam Amdjadi: so its WP Engine and I'm going to add you just now as a technical contact

**[06/09/2024, 13:32:53]** Sam Amdjadi: Seems you're already added

**[06/09/2024, 13:33:30]** Sam Amdjadi: heres the email I've used to correspond with them in the past:

support+id6882583@wpengine.zendesk.com

**[06/09/2024, 14:01:15]** Peter Empson: Great, I'll get in touch with them [This message was edited]

### New Brand Exploration - Anglepoise (9 Sept 2024)

**[09/09/2024, 14:38:32]** Sam Amdjadi: **New brand - Anglepoise**

I'm in the process of making a considerable investment to try and onboard this brand. I wanted to find out how strong this is from an online point of view. They certainly have a strong name in the UK and the 90 mini mini series seems popular. @Peter Empson can you provide some thoughts please

**[09/09/2024, 14:44:54]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[09/09/2024, 14:45:13]** Peter Empson: The benchmark is John Lewis

**[09/09/2024, 14:46:47]** Sam Amdjadi: they are currently matching angle poise own website who have an offer of £92. This will revert to £103. Regardless, we can compete with John Lewis and get to £90 if required. Cash margin would be around £30 on that price. So it will be interesting to estimate the cost per conversion

**[09/09/2024, 14:47:29]** Sam Amdjadi: John Lewis have much improved their product detail pages, but I think @Zoe Godshot can do better her also

**[09/09/2024, 15:14:58]** Peter Empson: I'm afraid it's not straightforward to estimate a CPA if there is no data to go on. The CPA would be dependent on the conversion rate which in the case of the products you have on at the moment is just under 4%.. If a 4% conversion rate could be achieved on Anglepoise then the CPA would be £6.17 but there are a lot of ifs, buts and maybes in there not least that we would need to get exposure on the ads which is not a quick thing to do because of the way that Google takes time to assess the products and ads

**[09/09/2024, 15:35:58]** Sam Amdjadi: I think around that could work. i suppose the only way is to try and then review

**[09/09/2024, 15:36:08]** Sam Amdjadi: I'll advance discussion with Anglepoise

**[09/09/2024, 15:36:35]** Peter Empson: Ye sthat would be the only way we could know for sure but it depends how much its going to cost you to find out

**[09/09/2024, 15:52:54]** Sam Amdjadi: lets see what we can agree in terms of initial stock purchase

---

### Budget Reactivation - £20/day to £35/day (15 Sept 2024)

**[15/09/2024, 12:59:39]** Sam Amdjadi: @Peter Empson might be good to just turn on all ads so we can see how the next week goes. Keen to get sales up so we can see how Fellow will do and what kind of stocks we need to order

**[15/09/2024, 13:23:22]** Peter Empson: Ok.

**[15/09/2024, 20:46:50]** Peter Empson: All ads are re-activated but the budget will need increasing from £20/day. I would suggest at least £35

**[15/09/2024, 21:42:15]** Sam Amdjadi: Let's try it and see what happens

**[15/09/2024, 22:00:11]** Peter Empson: Done, budget is £35/day - please don't expect miracles straight awayit needs to get momentm going again

**[17/09/2024, 13:13:24]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

### EAN Numbers Request - Fellow Carter Wide Mugs (19-20 Sept 2024)

**[19/09/2024, 11:08:05]** Peter Empson: Do you have an EAN numbers for the Fellow Carter Wide Mugs?

**[19/09/2024, 11:11:17]** Zoe Godshot: I'll check the packaging this afternoon

**[19/09/2024, 11:14:57]** Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe

**[20/09/2024, 14:59:23]** Zoe Godshot: Hi Peter, I checked our stock and we are still selling through the Carter Everywhere mugs at the moment, so we don't actually have any Carter Wide Mugs to hand. Not sure if both products share the same codes, but I think the only difference between them is the name. Here are the barcodes from the packaging—

Stone blue: 84022802471
Matte grey: 852212007847
Matte white: 852212007823
Matte black: 852212007809
Cargo green OOS

### Strong Performance Check-in (23-24 Sept 2024)

**[23/09/2024, 17:19:09]** Peter Empson: Sales up 42% on last month already with a spend of £405 which is a ROAS of 700%. Just wanted to check in with you both that this is OK and not putting to much of a strain on operations and stock [This message was edited]

**[24/09/2024, 09:21:44]** Sam Amdjadi: yeah we've been keeping a close eye on this - thanks for checking in. Operationally Zoe is hit but we're making it work. Unfortunately we had an issue in store with a young (malicious) member of staff and this reached havoc - the remanence of which we're dealing with (including helping in store).

But the good news we're meeting a couple of people later today to help with pick/pack and stock receiving/inventory checks.

We've been able to react to stock requirements and are reasonably well positioned on that front for further growth. [This message was edited]

**[24/09/2024, 09:35:58]** Peter Empson: Thanks Sam, sorry to hear that. As the account re-establishes itself the volume of traffic available to us will increase, already there is potential to spend another £10 per day and still achieve the same ROAS target. Let me know when you are ready to expand a bit more.

**[24/09/2024, 09:38:15]** Peter Empson: It would help if you had some EANs for the Lochby journal, it is flying but it is limited in its reach by not having an EAN

### EAN/GTIN Discussion - Where to Add (24 Sept 2024)

**[24/09/2024, 12:11:24]** Zoe Godshot: Where are these added to the website? I've added to Lightspeed but not sure it translates

**[24/09/2024, 13:45:49]** Peter Empson: Hi Zoe, I'm afraid I don't know - Sam's your man

**[24/09/2024, 13:55:50]** Zoe Godshot: So how do they assist ads? Is there somewhere else that EANs are inputted?

**[24/09/2024, 14:04:57]** Peter Empson: Somehow Sam has inputted them into the Woocommerce cataogue so that when I extract the data I can put them into Google Merchant Centre. GMC is where the info for the ads is taken from , having the EAN number makes for more comlete data and enables the ads to show in more places

**[24/09/2024, 14:12:52]** Zoe Godshot: Ah ok I see. Could you give me an example of a product that has an EAN so I can find where it's been entered on lightspeed/ woocommerce?

**[24/09/2024, 14:13:49]** Peter Empson: Most of the Fellows products have them, try https://mygodshot.com/product/fellow-opus-conical-burr-grinder/?attribute_pa_fellow-colour=matte-black
I have this as product id 17785 [This message was edited]

**[24/09/2024, 14:14:12]** Peter Empson: EAN is 840228803997

**[24/09/2024, 14:16:47]** Zoe Godshot: I've just had a quick look and it's nowhere immediately obvious… @Sam Amdjadi?

### Budget Increase to £65/day (26-27 Sept 2024)

**[26/09/2024, 11:21:53]** Peter Empson: The account is currently being constrained by the budget which is set at £35/day. There is potential to hit the current target ROAS of 700% with a higher daily budget which would result in higher sales volume. In April the budget was £80/day and the target ROAS was being hit. The suggested budget is £65/day, are you ready for this sort of increase in sales?

**[27/09/2024, 11:41:41]** Sam Amdjadi: I guess theres only one way to find out - lets do it and see what happens 🤞

---

### Payment Issue Quick Fix (2 Oct 2024)

**[02/10/2024, 09:28:15]** Sam Amdjadi: ads were paused I believe due to a payment issue. I had to update card details due to an issue with old card. Please keep an eye on ads today

**[02/10/2024, 09:48:50]** Peter Empson: …every day 😀 Thanks for the heads-up

### Major Feed Migration - Channable Replacement (11 Oct 2024)

**[11/10/2024, 10:51:11]** Peter Empson: After a month of to-ing and fro-ing between the hosting company and Channable I have had to take the decision to replace Channable with another data feed management system which I have just implemented. It wasn't the easiest of implementations and despite my best endeavours there are a few discrepancies in the feed but they are minor and not in fields that have a huge influence on visibility. I'm not expecting any changes to performance but you can never guarantee how Google will react to changes. I have also been working on optimising the product titles so that they get the best exposure for the products. This process is an ongoing one and I'm prioritising the best sellers first

**[11/10/2024, 11:01:17]** Sam Amdjadi: Thanks for the update. Zoe and I had been chatting about how we can make improvements here also. We've noticed Fellow isn't performing as it previously was - do you have any info on this. In other news, we've brought Anglepoise on and will be working on adding them in, as well as another exciting brand

**[11/10/2024, 11:02:40]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[11/10/2024, 11:05:42]** Peter Empson: Its interesting how many other brands are working as well now - Dak, Rains, 19-69, Kinto - better not to have all your eggs in one basket

**[11/10/2024, 11:07:06]** Peter Empson: At the risk of sounding like a stuck record I could do with more GTINS if possible - Rains, 19-69 and KInto for starters

### Operational Challenges - Physical Store Struggles (25 Oct 2024)

**[25/10/2024, 12:05:20]** Peter Empson: Is it possible to match the prices for Fellow?

**[25/10/2024, 12:08:04]** Sam Amdjadi: Hey Peter, a little update from our side:

- we've been stretched to the limit the past month working 7 days to support the physical space (staff issues)
- we've purchased new shelving to optimise the storage space for e-commerce
- I'm training someone to support Zoe so she can put more time to product addition and supporting you

**[25/10/2024, 12:09:15]** Sam Amdjadi: on top of all of those, stupid things have decimated our time and mental energy: blocked drain at shop and other fixes.

**[25/10/2024, 12:09:16]** Peter Empson: Awesome, that's all positive but not great about being so stretched

**[25/10/2024, 12:10:02]** Peter Empson: I'll stick to the digital world although that does produce its own challenges!

**[25/10/2024, 12:14:44]** Sam Amdjadi: We have days when we just want to stop. Its been exhausting of late and getting covid in the midst of it didnt help. But like you say, we all have issues of sorts and have to find a way to navigate them whilst staying sane

**[25/10/2024, 12:16:07]** Peter Empson: You're building something great Sam

**[25/10/2024, 12:17:34]** Sam Amdjadi: maybe we'll have to eventually shut down the physical store that is draining so much of our time and focus online only

**[25/10/2024, 12:18:03]** Peter Empson: Could it support a full time manager?

**[25/10/2024, 12:19:23]** Sam Amdjadi: Finding people that care is very difficult here but its certainly something we have to consider. The store is struggling with the existing manager

**[25/10/2024, 12:19:27]** Sam Amdjadi: (lesley) n

**[25/10/2024, 12:20:19]** Peter Empson: I must admit its why I've never grown the business

**[25/10/2024, 12:21:39]** Sam Amdjadi: if you can keep it staff free, I would. In any business I've owned, staff are the number one problem (and opportunity). Most independent businesses in Glasgow now try to operate a model to avoid recruitment. e.g. open only 3 days etc

**[25/10/2024, 12:25:14]** Zoe Godshot: I've put Opus at £175 from £185, reviewed Stagg also but seems to be competitive at £150 with free delivery. Are there other lines we should reduce?

**[25/10/2024, 12:27:49]** Peter Empson: Thanks Zoe

**[25/10/2024, 12:28:20]** Peter Empson: The sales on all of Fellow have dropped dramatically, it might be worth revieweing the top sellers and comparing online

### Anglepoise Launch - Competitive Pricing Strategy (28-29 Oct 2024)

**[28/10/2024, 16:24:28]** Sam Amdjadi: Anglepoise: we've now got these in stock. They are the best sellers and we can match Amazon

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anglepoise-Anodised-Brushed-Aluminium-Finish/dp/B07MWSGF6F?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A3Q9DMXZ46SDD0

**[28/10/2024, 17:50:08]** Peter Empson: Great, I'll take a look

**[29/10/2024, 16:02:36]** Sam Amdjadi: [image omitted]

**[29/10/2024, 16:03:39]** Sam Amdjadi: Let me know what price we need to be at and if anything else needed form our side

**[29/10/2024, 16:54:46]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[29/10/2024, 16:55:50]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[29/10/2024, 17:24:15]** Sam Amdjadi: [image omitted]

**[29/10/2024, 17:25:00]** Sam Amdjadi: In theory we could try £214.99, free delivery and next day

**[29/10/2024, 17:25:16]** Peter Empson: It seems to be setting a bar on price along with Lamp Twist

**[29/10/2024, 17:25:54]** Sam Amdjadi: I belive they are grey import

**[29/10/2024, 17:26:19]** Sam Amdjadi: We can emphasise our credentials as uk and authorise partner

**[29/10/2024, 17:26:47]** Peter Empson: We can't do that in the shopping ad tho'

**[29/10/2024, 17:27:07]** Peter Empson: We can try the £214.99 as it undercuts John Lewis

**[29/10/2024, 17:27:26]** Sam Amdjadi: There is no doubt that customer will initially click them but see quite quickly it's a 6 week lead time

**[29/10/2024, 17:27:53]** Peter Empson: The only way is to test it and see what we get

**[29/10/2024, 17:28:03]** Peter Empson: Rarthet go in too high than too low

**[29/10/2024, 17:28:11]** Peter Empson: Preserve the margin

**[29/10/2024, 17:28:52]** Sam Amdjadi: I think 214 is a competitive start. We can always bring down a bit of required

**[29/10/2024, 17:29:39]** Peter Empson: OK

**[29/10/2024, 17:30:19]** Peter Empson: I could put these in a separate campaign to start with so that we can get some traction but it would be at a lower target ROAS

**[29/10/2024, 17:39:40]** Sam Amdjadi: Sounds good. Zoe will recheck the product pages tonight also

**[29/10/2024, 22:02:16]** Peter Empson: Having the GTINs for the Anglepoise lamps would really help with it being so competitive

**[29/10/2024, 22:15:21]** Sam Amdjadi: Zoe has updated pricing and stock. Will forward gtins tomorrow whne have packaging in front of me

**[29/10/2024, 23:03:45]** Sam Amdjadi: It would be great to get to the bottom of fellow sales. We're fairly overstocked (big investment) and I'm always worried with such products that it can very easily become out of date if they release something new

**[29/10/2024, 23:04:08]** Sam Amdjadi: we have completely stopped amazon sales (by from from fellow)

**[30/10/2024, 01:02:09]** Sam Amdjadi: [image omitted]

**[30/10/2024, 07:25:59]** Peter Empson: Free delivery was set so that it wa soirders over£100 so I have changed that to £99.99

**[30/10/2024, 08:28:42]** Peter Empson: With the Fellow products there are now a lot more competitors in the market lace who are offering free delivery and who maybe have lower ROAS targets than we do

**[30/10/2024, 08:47:21]** Peter Empson: There are quite a few Fellow products that do not have 'Fellow' set as the brand name. I use the brand name to group products together so if it isn't set then the product will not be contained in the grouping e.g. 19558, 19551

**[30/10/2024, 09:00:36]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

### Product Review Stars Discussion (31 Oct 2024)

**[31/10/2024, 10:14:48]** Sam Amdjadi: [image omitted]

**[31/10/2024, 10:15:00]** Sam Amdjadi: this is one for @Zoe Godshot

**[31/10/2024, 10:16:39]** Sam Amdjadi: [image omitted]

**[31/10/2024, 10:17:46]** Peter Empson: What in particular Sam The review stars? [This message was edited]

**[31/10/2024, 10:19:27]** Sam Amdjadi: yeah

**[31/10/2024, 10:20:38]** Peter Empson: Shop ratings show with Search Network campaigns and they'll only serve in a country when one of the following criteria is met:

Google has received or collected enough unique reviews for the country within the last 24 months across Google Customer Reviews or our third-party review partners to confidently calculate a shop rating. The number of reviews needed can vary from business to business, but most merchants are able to obtain a rating after collecting 100 or more eligible reviews.
Google or its partners have completed a research evaluation of your site.
Additionally, both of the following criteria must be met:

Average, composite, rating of 3.5 or more stars for text ads
Unpaid listings can show shop ratings if the average rating is less than 3.5 stars
The ad's visible URL domain must match the domain for which we have the ratings

**[31/10/2024, 10:20:53]** Peter Empson: Are you collecting product reviews via Trustpilot?

**[31/10/2024, 10:21:38]** Sam Amdjadi: Not sure about product, but Zoe has been working on these

https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.mygodshot.com

**[31/10/2024, 10:21:39]** Peter Empson: If you are then they will automatically be sending them to Google, when the threshold and criteria are met then Google may(or may not) show the reviews

**[31/10/2024, 10:22:00]** Peter Empson: The stars in the ads are product reviews

**[31/10/2024, 10:22:07]** Peter Empson: and relate to that product

**[31/10/2024, 10:23:26]** Peter Empson: If you are collecting product reviews/ratings then sooner or later I would suggest showing them on the relevant product pages

### Stutterheim Brand Exploration (31 Oct 2024)

**[31/10/2024, 10:29:52]** Sam Amdjadi: **Stutterheim** A brand i've worked to bring on board and we have access to keen pricing.

Is there something to be done online? This is their most popular product

https://stutterheim.com/en-gb/men/best-sellers/stockholm-lightweight-light-sand

**[31/10/2024, 10:30:12]** Sam Amdjadi: We could sell for £150ish

**[31/10/2024, 10:32:55]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[31/10/2024, 10:33:10]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[31/10/2024, 10:33:58]** Sam Amdjadi: unfortunately thats the nature of these things - there are always cons. If you dig deeper, you'll see that those prices relate to random sizes and one off's

**[31/10/2024, 10:34:37]** Peter Empson: I find that you don't know until you put the product up there. It would all depend on how aggressive the competition are with their bidding.

You've got to be careful that you don't end up trying to be the Amazon of the higher end product world asyou could spread yourself too thinly

**[31/10/2024, 10:36:23]** Sam Amdjadi: My experience is trying to find a couple of products within a brand that are going under the radar, so to say. A bag, an accessory etc. Use that as the means to generate sales and gradually build the brand (in store / online)

### Colour Attribute Complexity (31 Oct 2024)

**[31/10/2024, 10:44:40]** Zoe Godshot: It started because at some point I found I could upload swatches instead of have a drop down menu to select product variant and so implemented it brand by brand, creating a new attribute each time. In theory I could put them all under 1 attribute, but would there still be the same issue if I'm trying to distinguish colours that are the same by name but have different images? ie there may be 15 different variants called 'red' distinguished by different slugs

**[31/10/2024, 10:47:37]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[31/10/2024, 10:49:42]** Zoe Godshot: Yeah

**[31/10/2024, 10:50:11]** Zoe Godshot: [image omitted]

**[31/10/2024, 10:50:20]** Peter Empson: Mmmm I can see why you've done it

**[31/10/2024, 10:50:55]** Zoe Godshot: There is an argument for simplifying it though. We can't allow customers to filter products by colour at the moment

**[31/10/2024, 10:50:58]** Peter Empson: Is there any way when you set the attribute you could also populate the 'colour' attribute at the same time?

**[31/10/2024, 10:51:33]** Peter Empson: You could use the brand colour for the swatches and the generic colour to filter

**[31/10/2024, 10:51:48]** Peter Empson: The swatches do look good

**[31/10/2024, 11:07:00]** Zoe Godshot: For the Google ads, is it as simple as creating the colours as variants under the main 'colour' attribute? Or does it need to be linked to the product in some way? Ive added 'Alessi Test Product' to the site to play with. It's got the Alessi colour attribute visible to customers, but also assigned the main 'colour' attribute hidden from customer view

**[31/10/2024, 11:07:32]** Peter Empson: I'll take a look

**[31/10/2024, 11:10:19]** Peter Empson: color or colour?

**[31/10/2024, 11:13:56]** Peter Empson: The proper spelling!

**[31/10/2024, 11:15:07]** Zoe Godshot: I believe 'color' was added by Lesley, certainly not me 😅

**[31/10/2024, 11:15:47]** Peter Empson: You're off the hook!

**[31/10/2024, 11:44:17]** Peter Empson: That s for product id 21514

**[31/10/2024, 11:45:06]** Peter Empson: There is also a product under 21515 which also has this colour

**[31/10/2024, 11:45:34]** Peter Empson: Its as though ithe colour has been set for the parent rather than the variants

### Anglepoise EAN Request & Early Success (6-11 Nov 2024)

**[06/11/2024, 08:33:23]** Peter Empson: I could do with some EAN numbers for the Anglepoise range, these are very competitive so the more data we have in them the better. A spreadsheet with the 2 columns  - item id and EAN - would be more than enough

**[08/11/2024, 14:20:23]** Sam Amdjadi: We'll get those to you today. I noticed a chrome 1227 mini sold!

**[08/11/2024, 14:20:56]** Sam Amdjadi: atm our sales seem mostly dependant on kinto and fellow. It would be good to get another heavy hitting brand onboard

**[11/11/2024, 16:26:24]** Peter Empson: Hi Sam, sorry for the delayed response I had an early finish on Friday. I'd set up an individual campaign for the anglepoise lamps, and that seems to be doing the trick (ROAS is over 400%). I'm actually quite surprised how quickly the campaign has taken off. Once we get a bit more traction, I'll put that into the standard P Max campaign.

**[11/11/2024, 20:30:45]** Sam Amdjadi: Mygodshot concept store - Sheet55.pdf • 1 page document omitted

**[11/11/2024, 20:32:55]** Peter Empson: Thanks Sam, any weekend in The Lakes is a good one! I'll load these on, keep them coming

**[15/11/2024, 12:00:09]** Peter Empson: Hi Zoe, sorry for the delay in getting back to you about the GTIN numbers, I have been trying all sorts to try and pull them into the feed but I'm having no luck. I've raised a ticket with the product feed providers who can hopefully help me find the data

**[19/11/2024, 18:01:42]** Peter Empson: Found It !!!!!

### Instagram Hack Crisis & Sale Event (20 Nov 2024)

**[20/11/2024, 10:15:26]** Sam Amdjadi: [image omitted]

**[20/11/2024, 10:16:36]** Peter Empson: So that is your business profile, it wont affect what I'm doing in Google Ads. Thanks for letting me know

**[20/11/2024, 11:59:31]** Sam Amdjadi: so two more things to share with you:

1. Our instagram account of 4 years with 12,000 followers was somehow hacked over the weekend and we were held to ransom. We have no access and trying to contact meta. Its been traumatic and a completely nightmare. I contemplated just stopping everything as it so depressing after thousands of hours of work.
2. We've got a sale event tonight at 7pm. Email will go out to newsletter subscribers. Not a profit maker but hoping to generate 10k sales to get rid of slow selling items.

**[20/11/2024, 12:00:04]** Peter Empson: Oh no!!!

**[20/11/2024, 12:00:41]** Peter Empson: I wish I could help you with that but its something I've not come across before

**[20/11/2024, 12:01:02]** Peter Empson: You've gone too far to stop now Sam!

**[20/11/2024, 12:01:04]** Sam Amdjadi: Its honestly so demoralising. I've managed to meta verify my personal account and speak to instagram

**[20/11/2024, 12:01:27]** Peter Empson: Fingers crossed for you

**[20/11/2024, 12:49:45]** Sam Amdjadi: thanks - I previously lost an account with 40k followers. Seems lighting does strike twice. I'm just perplexed how they accessed an account with 2 step verification..

**[20/11/2024, 12:51:27]** Sam Amdjadi: In other news, had a long discussion with WP Engine. They are going ot move us to a dedicated server with significantly improved service and performance

**[20/11/2024, 12:51:44]** Sam Amdjadi: migration taking place just now and should complete by 5pm

**[20/11/2024, 14:05:48]** Peter Empson: Thats good news

**[20/11/2024, 14:06:30]** Peter Empson: There are a lot of unnecessary plugins on Wordpress that could do wioth being removed, they will be slowing things down

**[20/11/2024, 14:06:52]** Sam Amdjadi: yeah I did a first fix recently. Planning on a second flush soon

### Epic Sale Night - 29x ROAS (21 Nov 2024)

**[21/11/2024, 10:34:31]** Peter Empson: What just happened?

**[21/11/2024, 10:35:36]** Peter Empson: That was some Sale!

**[21/11/2024, 10:48:55]** Sam Amdjadi: We're now dealing with the aftermath. We were here till early hours. Big job now to manage/communicate/dispatch/arrange pick up etc.

**[21/11/2024, 10:49:05]** Sam Amdjadi: ultimately its not a money maker - we just wanted to clear out older stocks

**[21/11/2024, 10:49:24]** Sam Amdjadi: So overall a net loss but better to generate some cash to pay suppliers!]

**[21/11/2024, 10:49:51]** Peter Empson: and it gives the bid strategy some great data

**[21/11/2024, 10:50:37]** Sam Amdjadi: Such a shame our instagram is in limbo - it was a very warm audience and things would have gone even better last night

**[21/11/2024, 10:51:34]** Peter Empson: How much sale stock is left?

**[21/11/2024, 10:51:53]** Peter Empson: It goes to show how price sensitive the market is

**[21/11/2024, 10:52:14]** Peter Empson: better to do it the week before Black Friday when the clicks will be a lot more expensive

**[21/11/2024, 10:53:41]** Peter Empson: There is more capacity with the budget, its currently on £79 but could go to £130 but I would suspect you don'y t need any more traffic!

**[21/11/2024, 10:54:19]** Peter Empson: 29X ROAS yesterday

**[21/11/2024, 11:03:46]** Sam Amdjadi: our website now has more scale in theory in terms of bandwidth

**[21/11/2024, 11:04:01]** Sam Amdjadi: We've still some stocks left, but feeling a lot better than this time yesterday

**[21/11/2024, 11:04:06]** Sam Amdjadi: cash was getting very tight indeed

**[21/11/2024, 11:04:17]** Peter Empson: Do you want me to increase?

**[21/11/2024, 11:04:54]** Peter Empson: The pricing data will be invaluable for you going forward

**[21/11/2024, 11:06:35]** Sam Amdjadi: go ahead

### Structured Data Issue & Capacity Increase (2-3 Dec 2024)

**[02/12/2024, 17:15:55]** Zoe Godshot: [image omitted]

**[02/12/2024, 22:20:52]** Peter Empson: [image omitted]

**[02/12/2024, 22:21:05]** Peter Empson: You can see this here https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/result/r%2Fproduct?id=xwkrGqryebEZRK9BSZAX5A

**[02/12/2024, 22:22:19]** Peter Empson: Not sure what to suggest here, its a dev thing that I am not familiar with

**[03/12/2024, 19:16:34]** Peter Empson: Google are suggesting there is capacity to increase the budget by £300 a day (?!!??!!) I wouldn't suggest going that far but it could be lifted by £100 per day if you have the stock, manpower and inclination

### Christmas Delivery Cutoff (18-23 Dec 2024)

**[18/12/2024, 10:48:11]** Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, so we've reached cut off now for delivery in so far as we'll not really be able to get orders out for xmas. What is the best way to deal with google to avoid wasting ad spend

**[18/12/2024, 10:48:35]** Peter Empson: I will make the necessary adjustments

**[20/12/2024, 10:26:59]** Sam Amdjadi: no orders will now leave until well after xmas. Zoe will need a break from incessant packing until at least mid jan. so probably best to minimise ad spend to an absolute minimum

**[20/12/2024, 10:40:24]** Peter Empson: OK

**[23/12/2024, 17:46:14]** Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, please pause all ads if not already done so - thanks. Have a lovely Christmas

**[23/12/2024, 17:49:32]** Peter Empson: Hi Sam

**[23/12/2024, 17:50:56]** Peter Empson: I have pulled the spend back dramatically since the 18th, its around £30/day now. I would rather keep the ads just ticking over rather than pausing them as the latter could affect them detrimentally when they go back on again. I can take it to £10/day?

### 2025 Planning Discussion (29-30 Dec 2024)

**[29/12/2024, 14:52:26]** Sam Amdjadi: Hi Peter, I'm looking to make plans for 2025 and naturally online represents the biggest growth for us. We did very well in Nov/Dec in terms of sales. Margin was hit hard as we targeted best pricing across big brands reducing prices by 30%+. But thats not necessarily an unmanageable situation. Operationally we were stretched also. The aim is now to take what we've learnt and move into 2025 with intentionality, starting with a headline plan:

- annual turnover
- annual marketing spend
- return on spend
- avg basket / daily sales

I can then use this information to flesh out some kind of plan and ensure we are working in unison. It'd be good to have your thoughts around what happened and what could be

**[30/12/2024, 11:16:13]** Peter Empson: Hi Sam, we haven't actually learnt enough from the sale in November and December to make a forecast. The sales during this period were off the back off high conversion rates brought about by sales prices and a seasonal increase. During the rest of the year these factors will not be in play and will affect the conversion rates that are achievable. In addition to this the campaigns were also limited by budget so I cannot tell what ROAS the campaigns would have been able to get given an elevated budget.

**[30/12/2024, 11:52:40]** Sam Amdjadi: I see - based on what we know so far, can we estimate some annual forecasts/targets? A lot of the operational, procurement rests on an element of planning.

Our inc VAT turnover this year seems to be c.£270k but that of course includes non trading period of June > Aug and a stop/start approach. What investment would we need to make with you if the goal was £500k a year? What about £750k? £1m?

I appreciate there are a lot of unknowns but there must be some semblance of a forecast we can make?

## Key Insights & Business Intelligence

### Financial Performance Journey

- Sept 26: £65/day (matching April performance)
- Oct-Nov: £79/day regular spend
- Nov 20 Sale: £130/day capacity
- Target ROAS: 700% maintained throughout

**Performance Highlights:**

- Nov 20 Sale: 29x ROAS (extraordinary)
- Annual turnover 2024: ~£270k (inc. VAT, with June-Aug non-trading)

### Operational Challenges

**Physical Store vs Online:**
- "We have days when we just want to stop" - exhaustion
- Considering closing physical store to focus online
- Staff management = "number one problem"
- Stretched capacity: Sam + Zoe working 7 days

**Critical Incidents:**
- Disgruntled ex-employee negative review campaign (legal action taken)
- Instagram hack: 12,000 follower account ransomed (second time, previously lost 40k)
- COVID during peak period
- Blocked drain and store maintenance issues

**Operational Improvements:**
- New shelving for e-commerce storage optimisation
- Training additional person to support Zoe
- WP Engine migration to dedicated server
- Plugin cleanup for performance

### Brand Portfolio Strategy

**Primary Brands (by performance):**
1. **Fellow** - Initially strong, then competitive pressure increased
   - Overstocked (big investment)
   - Amazon sales stopped by Fellow
   - More competitors offering free delivery
   - Lower ROAS targets from competition

2. **Kinto** - Strong performer

3. **Anglepoise** - Successful launch
   - Separate campaign: 400%+ ROAS
   - Faster traction than expected
   - Competitive against John Lewis at £214.99
   - GTINs critical for competitive edge

4. **Lochby** - "Flying" but limited without EANs

**Secondary Brands:**
- Dak, Rains, 19-69 (all performing well)
- Stutterheim (explored but very competitive)

**Strategic Approach:**
- "Better not to have all your eggs in one basket"
- Find products "going under the radar"
- Use one product to build brand presence gradually
- Avoid becoming "Amazon of higher end products" - don't spread too thin

### Technical Infrastructure

**Feed Management Journey:**
- Sept: 502 gateway errors with Channable
- Oct 11: Replaced Channable after month of troubleshooting
- WP Engine hosting (dedicated server upgrade Nov 20)
- GTIN field discovery: 2 support tickets, significant effort

**Data Quality Challenges:**
- EANs/GTINs constantly requested but difficult to provide
- Product titles optimisation (prioritising bestsellers)
- Brand names missing from many Fellow products
- Colour attribute complexity (brand-specific swatches vs generic filtering)

**Website Performance:**
- Multiple unnecessary WordPress plugins
- Structured data issues (schema markup)
- Free delivery threshold: £99.99 (was £100+)

### Pricing Strategy

**Philosophy:**
- "Rather go in too high than too low - preserve the margin"
- Test and adjust based on performance
- Match competitors but maintain margin
- Price sensitivity revealed in Nov 20 sale

**Competitive Pressure:**
- Fellow: competitors offering free delivery, lower ROAS targets
- Anglepoise: grey importers with 6-week lead times
- £30 margin on Anglepoise at £90 selling price

### Product Review Strategy

**Requirements for Google Stars:**
- 100+ eligible reviews (threshold)
- 3.5+ star average rating
- Product reviews (not just shop reviews)
- Currently using Trustpilot for shop reviews
- Recommendation: show product reviews on pages

### Communication Patterns

**Sam Amdjadi (Director):**
- Strategic thinker, brand relationship builder
- Entrepreneurial ("only one way to find out")
- Transparent about struggles ("contemplated just stopping everything")
- Business philosophy: avoid staff if possible
- Hands-on: working till early hours on sale night
- Cash flow conscious ("cash was getting very tight")

**Zoe Godshot (Operations/E-commerce):**
- Detail-oriented, technical capability (colour swatches implementation)
- Operationally stretched: "incessant packing"
- Proactive: product page improvements, pricing adjustments
- Learning curve: understanding EANs, GTINs, feed management
- Trustpilot review management

### 2025 Planning Context

**Targets Being Considered:**
- £500k annual turnover
- £750k annual turnover
- £1m annual turnover

**Constraints:**
- Conversion rates: seasonal (Nov/Dec) vs normal periods
- Budget limitations: campaigns were budget-limited in peak
- Operational capacity: can they fulfill higher volumes?
- Data limitations: not enough non-sale data for accurate forecasting

**Key Questions:**
- What investment needed for each turnover level?
- How to forecast without more baseline data?
- Operational scaling vs online growth focus

---

## Strategic Recommendations Provided

1. **Budget Scaling:** Gradual increases to maintain ROAS (£35→£65→£130)
2. **Brand Diversification:** Reduce Fellow dependency, spread across brands
3. **Separate Campaigns:** Launch competitive brands separately (Anglepoise)
4. **Data Quality:** GTINs/EANs essential for competitive products
5. **Pricing Position:** Start high, preserve margin, adjust if needed
6. **Timing:** Sale week before Black Friday (lower CPCs)
7. **Momentum Preservation:** Keep ads ticking over rather than pause completely
8. **Product Reviews:** Show on product pages to enable Google stars
9. **Feed Management:** Proper brand naming for product grouping
