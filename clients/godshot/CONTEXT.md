## Strategic Context

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Structure**: Single Performance Max campaign (GOD | P Max 700) driving all traffic
- **Bidding Strategy**: Maximize Conversion Value with **700% target ROAS** (set Nov 2025)
- **Key Focus Areas**: Hit 700% ROAS target during seasonal peak, product-level conversion tracking accuracy
- **Budget**: £190/day (~£5,700/month) - Increased from £64/day for Nov-Dec seasonal peak (coffee gifting season)
- **Target ROAS**: 700% (benchmark for Godshot profitability)

### Why This Approach?
- **Simplified structure**: Single PMax campaign eliminates complexity and allows Google's algorithm maximum flexibility across all surfaces (Search, Shopping, Display, YouTube, Discover)
- **Maximize Conversion Value**: Appropriate for e-commerce with varying product margins, allowing Google to optimize for revenue rather than conversion volume
- **Account re-enabled status**: Likely underwent account suspension/policy review, now back live since Oct 16, 2025

**Historical Campaign Tests** (Now Paused/Removed):
- Product-specific Shopping campaigns (Fellow Stagg, Anglepoise) with tROAS 300-800%
- Brand Search campaign
- Shopping campaign for "Specials" category
- DSA (Dynamic Search Ads) campaign

**Insight**: Previous strategy tested granular product-level campaigns with specific ROAS targets (300-800%). Current simplified approach suggests these didn't perform well or created management overhead.

### Goals & KPIs
**Primary Goal**: Revenue maximization at 700% ROAS target during seasonal peak
**Target ROAS**: 700% (set Nov 2025 for seasonal peak period)
**Recent Performance** (Nov 4-10, 2025 - after budget increase):
- **Spend**: £1,202.21
- **Revenue**: £6,650.81
- **ROAS**: 553% (21% below 700% target)
- **Conversions**: 95.9
- **Issue**: Asset groups Fellow, Rains, Coffee Generic burning budget with minimal/zero conversions

**Historical Performance** (Aug 1 - Oct 30, 2025 at £64/day budget):
- **Spend**: £751.16
- **Revenue**: £8,314.42
- **ROAS**: 1,107% (11.07x return)
- **Conversions**: 107
- **Conversion Rate**: 5.26% (107 conversions / 2,034 clicks)
- **Avg CPC**: £0.37
- **CTR**: 1.63%

**Performance Context**: Exceptional ROAS of 1,107% suggests either:
1. High-margin specialty products (coffee equipment, curated homewares)
2. Strong brand loyalty and repeat purchase behavior
3. Effective product curation targeting premium customers
4. Possible conversion tracking issues (see Known Issues)

## Historical Performance Patterns

### Seasonality
**Expected Patterns** (Specialty Coffee & Lifestyle Retail):
- **Peak Seasons**:
  - September-October (coffee season kickoff, autumn homeware refresh)
  - November-December (holiday gifting, coffee equipment gifts)
  - January-February (New Year coffee resolutions, post-holiday sales)
- **Moderate Seasons**:
  - March-May (spring refresh, Mother's Day gifting)
- **Slower Seasons**:
  - June-August (summer slowdown for coffee, reduced homeware purchases)

**Note**: Limited historical data available (account recently re-enabled). Monitor 2025-2026 to establish client-specific patterns.

### Website & Technical

**Website Platform**: WooCommerce (WordPress)
- Theme: Savoy
- Payment: WooCommerce Payments, Klarna integration
- Email Marketing: Mailchimp
- Features: AJAX cart, lazy loading, wishlist, prefetch optimization

**Known Technical Issues**:
1. **Product ID Mismatch** (CRITICAL): Google Shopping feed IDs (e.g., 21857) don't match WooCommerce IDs (e.g., 57584)
2. **Variant Tracking**: Generic product ads not tracking specific variants (colors, plug types) properly
3. **Product Feed Lag**: Possible delay between WooCommerce catalog updates and Merchant Center feed refresh

**Conversion Tracking**:
- **Setup**:
  - **Plugin**: Conversion Tracking for WooCommerce by weDevs (v2.1.4 - updated Nov 10, 2025)
  - **Purpose**: Adds conversion tracking codes to cart, checkout, registration success, and product pages
  - Google Analytics (GT-NCG4K6B)
  - Google Ads Conversion Tracking (AW-582226649)
  - WooCommerce native order tracking
- **Known Issues**:
  - Only 20% match rate between Google Ads "top converting" products and actual WooCommerce sales (Oct 28, 2025 analysis)
  - **Product ID mismatch**: Plugin is sending product data to Google Ads, but IDs don't align with Google Shopping feed IDs (e.g., feed ID 21857 vs WooCommerce ID 57584)
  - This causes incorrect product attribution despite product-level tracking functioning
  - Cross-device or multi-session attribution problems
- **Recent Changes**:
  - **Nov 10, 2025**: Plugin updated from v2.1.0 → v2.1.4
  - **Nov 12, 2025**: Initial verification shows tracking appears to be working correctly after plugin update
  - **Action Required**: Follow-up verification scheduled for next week to confirm sustained accuracy
  - **Review Date**: Nov 18-20, 2025
- **Last Audit**: Oct 28, 2025 (informal product reconciliation analysis)

### Competitive Landscape

**Main Competitors**:
- Specialty coffee retailers (local and online)
- Design-led homeware retailers (e.g., Toast, The Conran Shop)
- Multi-brand curated lifestyle stores (e.g., Labour and Wait, Present & Correct)

**Competitive Advantages**:
- **Integrated experience**: Café + Retail + Interior Design Practice creates immersive brand experience
- **Curation expertise**: ~10 featured European coffee roasters, design-led product selection
- **Physical presence in Glasgow**: Strong local community and tourism footfall
- **Brand storytelling**: Bi-annual print magazine, maker interviews, provenance focus
- **Nordic/Japanese aesthetic**: Clear design POV differentiates from generic coffee/homeware retailers

**Competitive Disadvantages**:
- **Single location**: Limited geographic reach vs. national chains
- **Premium pricing**: May alienate price-sensitive customers
- **Niche appeal**: Design-conscious audience smaller than mass market

---

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Issues

**CRITICAL - Conversion Tracking Misalignment (Oct 28, 2025)**
- **Issue**: Only 2 out of 10 Google Ads "top converting" products matched actual WooCommerce sales (20% match rate)
- **Impact**: Cannot reliably attribute revenue to specific Google Ads campaigns/products. Campaign optimization may be based on inaccurate signals.
- **Root Causes**:
  1. **Product ID mismatch**: Google Shopping feed uses custom IDs (e.g., 21857) while WooCommerce uses different IDs (e.g., 57584)
  2. **Generic purchase tracking**: Possible "purchase" event firing without product-level data
  3. **Variant-level tracking issues**: Ads for generic products (e.g., "Fellow Stagg Kettle") not tracking which variant was purchased (e.g., "Matte Black" vs. "White")
  4. **Browse-and-discover behavior**: Customers click on discovery sets/samples in ads but purchase full-size products on site
  5. **Multi-session attribution**: Customers may research via Google Ads but purchase later via direct/organic
- **Next Steps**:
  - Audit Google Ads conversion tracking tag implementation
  - Map Google Shopping feed product IDs to WooCommerce product IDs
  - Implement enhanced ecommerce tracking (GA4 + Google Ads)
  - Review attribution model settings (currently may be last-click)

**Product Feed Accuracy**
- Google Merchant Center feed may be using outdated or custom product IDs
- Variant products (colors, sizes, plug types) may not be properly mapped between WooCommerce and Shopping feed
- Feed refresh lag causing discrepancies between live catalog and Shopping ads

**Account Suspension History**
- Account was disabled prior to Oct 16, 2025
- Re-enabled Oct 16, 2025
- **Unknown reason** - may indicate previous policy violations (merchant center, ad policy, billing, etc.)
- **Risk**: Future suspensions if root cause not addressed
- **Action Required**: Request account history from Google Ads support to understand suspension reason

### Recurring Challenges
[TBD - establish over time as patterns emerge]

### External Factors to Monitor
- **Specialty coffee market trends**: Third-wave coffee movement growth/maturity
- **Consumer spending**: Premium/discretionary purchases sensitive to economic conditions
- **Tourism to Glasgow**: Physical store footfall tied to tourism recovery
- **Supply chain for specialty products**: Artisanal/small-batch products may have stock constraints
- **Seasonal weather**: Coffee consumption patterns affected by UK weather

---

## Key Learnings & Insights

### What Works Well
- **Single PMax campaign structure**: Simplified management, exceptional ROAS (1,107%)
- **Curated product selection**: Premium positioning resonates with target audience
- **Integrated brand experience**: Physical store + online retail creates strong brand halo effect
- **Strong CTR (1.63%)**: Effective ad creative and product imagery
- **High conversion rate (5.26%)**: Indicates strong intent from ad traffic and effective landing pages

### What Doesn't Work
- **Granular product-specific campaigns**: Previous Shopping campaigns for Fellow Stagg, Anglepoise now paused/removed (likely poor performance or management overhead)
- **Fixed ROAS targets (300-800%)**: Previous campaigns used tROAS bidding, now consolidated into Maximize Conversion Value (suggests targets were too rigid or unachievable)
- **Brand Search campaign**: Paused (low volume or cost-inefficient vs. organic brand traffic)
- **DSA campaign**: Paused (may have triggered irrelevant/low-intent queries)
- **Conversion tracking reliability**: 80% of Google Ads "top converting" products showed zero sales in WooCommerce (see Known Issues)

### Product Performance Analysis (Oct 21-28, 2025)

**Top WooCommerce Sellers** (by unit count):
1. **Dak - Milky Cake 250g** (4 units) - NOT in Google Ads top 10 (organic/direct traffic driver)
2. **Fellow Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2** (2 units) - ✅ Matched Google Ads (2.0 conv)
3. **Stora Skuggan Hexensalbe EDP 30ml** (2 units) - Different product than Google Ads "Discovery Set"
4. **Dak - Cream Donut 250g** (2 units) - NOT in Google Ads top 10

**Google Ads Top Converters** (that didn't match actual sales):
- **Kinto CLK-151 Cup 180ml** (2.25 conv, £1.20 spent) - ❌ 0 sold
- **Nasomatto Sample Set** (2.0 conv, £1.82 spent) - ❌ 0 sold
- **Dak - Yuzu Crew 125g** (2.0 conv, £7.76 spent) - ❌ 0 sold

**Key Insight**: Strong evidence of "browse-and-discover" shopping behavior. Customers:
1. Click on discovery sets/samples in Google Ads (low-commitment entry points)
2. Browse site and discover full product range
3. Purchase full-size products or different items from same brand/category
4. Google Ads gets conversion credit for clicked product, but actual sale is different item

**Strategic Implication**:
- Google Ads may be functioning as a "discovery engine" rather than direct-to-cart driver
- Current attribution model may undervalue Google Ads' role in customer journey
- Consider multi-touch attribution model or assisted conversions analysis

### Successful Tests & Experiments

| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Oct 28, 2025 | Google Ads vs WooCommerce product reconciliation analysis | 80% mismatch in product attribution | Flagged for conversion tracking audit |

### Failed Tests (Learn From)

| Date | Test Description | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Prior to Oct 2025 | Product-specific Shopping campaigns (Fellow Stagg, Anglepoise) with tROAS 300-800% | Now paused/removed | Granular campaigns with rigid ROAS targets either couldn't achieve targets or created management overhead. Single PMax with flexible Maximize Conversion Value outperformed. |
| Prior to Oct 2025 | Brand Search campaign | Now paused | Likely low volume or cost-inefficient vs. organic brand traffic for small specialty brand |
| Prior to Oct 2025 | DSA (Dynamic Search Ads) | Now paused | May have triggered irrelevant queries for niche specialty products, better to control messaging |

### Recent Experiments (from log):
- **Oct 16, 2025**: Account re-enabled
- **Oct 28, 2025**: Product-level conversion analysis revealed tracking issues

- **Structure**:
  - Channel: Performance Max
  - Bidding: Maximize Conversion Value (no fixed ROAS)
  - Daily Budget: £64/day (~£2,000/month)
- **Performance Notes** (Last 30 days):
  - Spend: £734.76
  - Revenue: £8,188.93

### Paused/Removed Campaigns (Historical Context)

**Fellow Stagg** (PMax, REMOVED)
- Previous attempt at product-specific PMax campaign
- Removed due to poor performance or strategic shift

**Fellow Stagg EKG** (Shopping, REMOVED; Search, PAUSED)
- Product-specific campaigns for popular coffee kettle
- Did not justify standalone campaign structure

**GOD | Shopping 650 11/11 800 22/11 700 7/4** (PAUSED)
- Previous main Shopping campaign with changing tROAS targets (650% → 800% → 700%)
- Frequent ROAS adjustments suggest performance challenges
- Replaced by PMax campaign

**GOD - Shopping Fellow 450** (PAUSED, tROAS 450%)
**GOD - Shopping Anglepoise 400 350 22/11 CPC 25/11 300 5/12** (PAUSED, tROAS 300-400%)
- Product-specific Shopping campaigns with lower ROAS targets
- Likely low volume or inconsistent performance

**GOD | Brand** (Search, PAUSED)
- Brand search protection campaign
- Paused suggests low brand search volume or organic coverage sufficient

**GOD | Specials 600 500 22/1 200 3/2** (Shopping, PAUSED, tROAS 200-600%)
- Campaign for sale/special products with highly variable ROAS targets
- Frequent adjustments indicate difficulty optimizing

**GOD | DSA** (Search, PAUSED)
- Dynamic Search Ads campaign
- Paused suggests poor performance for niche specialty products

**Insight from Historical Campaigns**:
- Multiple attempts at granular campaign structures with specific ROAS targets (200-800%)
- Frequent ROAS adjustments indicate optimization challenges
- Strategic shift to single PMax campaign with flexible bidding = simplified approach after testing complexity

## Ad Hoc Notes

### Website Research Findings (Oct 30, 2025)
- **Business Philosophy**: "Passion Drives Perfection" - Founded by Sam Amdjadi to find the perfect shot of coffee
- **Integrated Concept**: Store is not just retail - includes café service, interior design practice, library space
- **Publishing**: Produces bi-annual print magazine with designer interviews (content marketing opportunity)
- **European Coffee Focus**: ~10 featured roasters from across Europe (differentiation vs. single-origin/single-roaster competitors)
- **Design Aesthetic**: Strong Nordic/Japanese influence - appeals to design-conscious, minimalist audience
- **Product Curation**: "Buying less but better" philosophy aligns with premium pricing and sustainability trends

### Technical Stack
- **Platform**: WordPress + WooCommerce (Savoy theme)
- **Payments**: WooCommerce Payments, Klarna (BNPL option for higher-ticket items like grinders)
- **Email**: Mailchimp for newsletters and sale notifications
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (GT-NCG4K6B), Google Ads Conversion Tracking (AW-582226649)
- **Optimization**: AJAX cart, lazy loading, wishlist, prefetch - solid technical foundation

### Strategic Observations
1. **Customer Journey Insight**: Google Ads appears to function as "discovery engine" more than direct-to-cart driver. Customers click on entry-level products (samples, accessories) and then explore full range.
2. **Attribution Challenge**: Current last-click attribution may undervalue Google Ads' role in introducing customers to brand.
3. **Account Suspension Risk**: Unknown reason for previous suspension. Critical to investigate and document to prevent recurrence.
4. **Simplified Campaign Structure**: Evolution from complex multi-campaign structure with rigid ROAS targets → single PMax with flexible bidding suggests simplified approach performs better for small specialty retailer.
5. **Exceptional ROAS (1,107%)**: Either indicates truly exceptional performance OR conversion tracking issues are inflating results. Truth likely somewhere in between - premium products + strong brand + possible tracking inflation.

### Questions for Client (First Call)

## Notes for Future Population

**Priority areas to populate as data becomes available**:
1. ✅ **Account Overview** - Populated from Google Ads API and website research
2. ✅ **Strategic Context** - Populated from campaign analysis and historical data
3. ⏳ **Client Preferences** - Need email communications and initial client calls
4. ✅ **Business Context** - Populated from website research and product analysis
5. ✅ **Known Issues** - Documented conversion tracking issues and account suspension
6. ✅ **Campaign Notes** - Populated from Google Ads API campaign data
7. ⏳ **Seasonality** - Need full-year historical data to confirm patterns
8. ⏳ **Client Contacts** - Obtain from initial onboarding
9. ⏳ **GA4 Property ID** - Request from client
10. ⏳ **Product Margin Data** - Request from client (sensitive data)

**Next Steps**:
1. Schedule initial client call to gather missing information (contacts, GA4 ID, account suspension reason)
2. Audit conversion tracking setup (critical priority)
3. Review Google Merchant Center feed vs. WooCommerce catalog
4. Set up weekly reconciliation process for product attribution
5. Monitor account for policy compliance to prevent future suspensions
