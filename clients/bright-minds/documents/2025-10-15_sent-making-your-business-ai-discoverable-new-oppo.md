Subject: Making Your Business AI-Discoverable - New Opportunity for [Client Name]

Hi,

I hope you're well. I'm reaching out about something I've been researching that could benefit your business - helping AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini understand and recommend your business accurately.

What's This About?

As AI assistants become more common for research and recommendations, I've learned we can help them provide accurate information about your business by creating two simple files for your website:

1. llms.txt - A comprehensive guide about your business that AI assistants can reference 

2. agents.txt - A Q&A resource that helps AI answer specific questions about your offerings

Why This Matters

People increasingly use AI for purchase research and recommendations
You can ensure AI provides accurate, current information about your business
It's relatively new, so implementing it now puts you ahead of the curve
AI can effectively explain your value proposition 24/7
What I Need From You

To create these files effectively, I need answers to these 10 questions:

What's your one-sentence value proposition? (The clearest statement of what makes you different)
Who is your ideal customer? (Be specific: size, industry, location, challenges they face)
What are your top 3 products/services? (Include what makes each notable)
What questions do customers ask most often? (List 5-10 common queries)
What makes you different from competitors? (Your unique advantages or approach)
What do customers misunderstand about your business? (Common misconceptions that need clarification)
What's your typical customer journey? (From first contact through to ongoing relationship)
What problems do you solve? (The real challenges you address)
What should AI agents know to help people find you? (Key situations or search terms that indicate someone needs your services)
What pages on your site are most important? (Key landing pages, product pages, contact information)
Timeline

Please note it will take me a few a few hours to do properly. I'll aim to return them as soomn as possible after receiving your answers, depending on my current workload.

What Happens Next

Once you receive your files:

1. Upload the Files

Have your web developer save both files to your website's root directory
They should be accessible at yourdomain.com/llms.txt and yourdomain.com/agents.txt
2. Verify They're Live

Check both URLs in your browser to confirm they're accessible
3. Test with AI (After 24-48 hours)

Try asking AI assistants about your business to see how they respond
4. Keep Them Updated

Review quarterly or when you make significant business changes
Simply edit and re-upload as needed
Next Steps

If you're interested in implementing this, please reply with your answers to the 10 questions above. The more detail you provide, the better AI will be able to represent your business.

I've already implemented this for Rok Systems - you can test it by asking ChatGPT about "Rok Systems PPC management" to see how it works.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

Regards

Peter
