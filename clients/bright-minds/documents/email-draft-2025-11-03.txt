Subject: Bright Minds - Last Week's Performance

Hi Barry,

Quick update on last week:

Last 7 Days (Oct 27 - Nov 2):
- Revenue: £3,733 (+45% vs previous week)
- Spend: £1,235 (+42%)
- ROAS: 302% (improving toward 400% target)

As we head into Q4, we'll be gradually increasing budget to around £260/day to capture the Christmas demand. As previously discussed, the budget will be going up but the revenue will be going up accordingly - we're already seeing that trend with ROAS improving week-on-week. I'll keep the weekly updates coming so you can see exactly what's happening.

All looking good.

Best,
Peter
