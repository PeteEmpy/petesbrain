Hi Both

I wanted to give you a quick update on your Google Ads performance since I started making those big changes on October 8th.

The Short Version We're seeing real results. After accounting for normal October sales growth, the changes have delivered a 22% revenue boost above what we'd typically expect this time of year.

The Numbers That Matter

Last Year's October Boost: +18.5% (normal seasonal increase) 

This Year After Changes: +40.5% (your actual increase) 

Real Impact of Our Changes: +22% above normal seasonal growth

Money In vs Money Out

Extra Ad Spend: £594
Extra Revenue (above seasonal): £1,735
Return: £2.92 back for every £1 spent
Good Signs We're Seeing 

✓ Average order up to £37.53 (was £34.64 last year)
✓ Already beating seasonal trends by 22%
✓ Return climbing toward £4 target as Google learns

Bottom Line The restructure is working. You're getting nearly £3 back for every extra £1 spent, and this should reach £4 as Google finishes learning your best customers. You're ahead of last year's seasonal curve and building momentum for peak season.

I know the increased spend can feel uncomfortable when you're not seeing the full return yet, but the data shows we're on the right track. Google just needs another week or two to fully optimize.

Any questions, just give me a shout!


Regards

Peter
