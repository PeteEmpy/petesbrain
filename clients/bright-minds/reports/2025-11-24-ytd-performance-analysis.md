## What Happened

### 2024: Broken Foundation
- Previous agency spending £600/month (Jan-Sep) with broken conversion tracking
- Google Ads couldn't optimise properly - money essentially wasted
- Only November showed results (peak season carried it)
- **Total 2024 spend (Jan-Nov):** £17,962

### 2025 Jan-Sep: Life Support
- Account on minimal spend (~£150/month) while issues persisted
- Sales declined 25-40% YoY across most months
- No proper campaign structure or tracking
- **Spend Jan-Sep 2025:** £1,238

### October 8th 2025: The Turnaround
- ROK took over account management
- Complete restructure: PMax + Brand Search (clean 2-campaign structure)
- Fixed conversion tracking
- Implemented Product Hero for feed optimisation
- **Result:** October sales £22,895 (first £20k+ month since Oct 2024)

### November 2025: Recovery Accelerates
- Scaled spend for Q4 peak season
- ROAS consistently 370-420%
- On track to match or beat Nov 2024 sales
- **Spending £3k less** than Nov 2024 while closing the gap

## The ROI Story

### Efficiency Comparison

**2024 (Previous Agency):**
- £198k sales on £18k ad spend
- Ratio: 11:1
- But: Broken tracking means this is misleading - couldn't optimise

**2025 (ROK - Full Year):**
- £167k sales on £10.4k ad spend
- Ratio: 16:1
- **45% more efficient** despite lower overall sales

**Since Oct 8th Restructure:**
- £91k sales on £9.2k ad spend
- Ratio: 10:1 (and improving weekly)
- Provable, trackable, optimising

### The Real Win

They've spent **£7,500 less** on Google Ads this year.

The sales decline is £31k - but that's **not** because of reduced ad spend. The first 9 months were already declining before we took over.

Since October:
- Sales trajectory reversed
- November closing the YoY gap (now only -7% vs -39% in September)
- Spending less, converting better
- System is learning and improving weekly

## Key Messages for Client

1. **Google Ads is now working** - After a year of poor results from the previous setup, we've proven it can be profitable.

2. **Better efficiency, not just more spend** - Getting £16 back for every £1 spent (2025) vs £11 (2024). That's 45% more efficient.

3. **Q4 recovery is real** - November on track to nearly match last year while spending £3k less on ads.

4. **The foundation is fixed** - Clean structure, proper tracking, smart bidding. This will compound into 2026.

5. **Trust the weekly updates** - The cautious approach (weekly reporting, gradual budget increases) has paid off.

Hi Barry and Sharon,

Now that Black Friday is behind us, I wanted to share a bigger picture view of how 2025 has shaped up.

[Insert final November numbers]

Looking at the full year: you've spent £7,500 less on Google Ads than 2024, but the return on that spend is significantly better. For every £1 spent this year, you're getting £16 back in sales vs £11 last year - that's 45% more efficient.

The real turnaround started in October when we restructured the account. Since then, November has nearly closed the gap with last year (only -X% vs -39% back in September), and we're spending less to get there.

The foundation is now solid - proper tracking, clean campaign structure, and a system that's learning what works. This sets us up well for 2026.

Happy to walk through any of this in more detail if useful.

Best,
Peter
