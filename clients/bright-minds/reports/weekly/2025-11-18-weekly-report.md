- **CPA:** £9.70 vs £10.71 (-9.4%) ✓

## Target ROAS Performance

### PMax Campaign vs Target

**Target ROAS:** 330% (set Nov 17, 2025)
**Actual ROAS:** 376%
**Performance:** **+46pp above target** (+14%) ✓

**Historical Context:**
Campaign has tested multiple target ROAS levels:
- Oct 13: 300%
- Oct 14: 400% (too aggressive?)
- Oct 20: 300% (pulled back)
- Nov 9: 310% (incremental increase)
- Nov 17: 330% (current)

**Insight:** Account team has been systematically testing efficiency boundaries. Current 330% target appears to be the "sweet spot" - delivering 376% actual ROAS.

## Brand Search Optimization Opportunity

### Expand Brand Coverage?

**Current State:**
- 1,349 impressions/week on branded terms
