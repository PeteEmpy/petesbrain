## 🎯 **What Was Agreed**

From your email to Barry (15th December):

> **Post-18th December spend plan:**
> **19th Dec – 8th Jan: £60-80/day** (very low spend, profitable only)
> **9th Jan onwards: Gradual ramp back up** (start £150/day, scale based on performance)

Barry agreed: "I am happy to keep things running on a very low spend through Christmas, rather than stopping completely."

## 📊 **4-Phase Deployment Plan**

### **Phase 1: Dec 19 - Jan 8 (Christmas Maintenance)**

| Campaign | Current | New | Change |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| **PMax Generic** | £840/day | £60/day | **-£780** (93% decrease) |
| **Search Brand** | £64/day | £10/day | **-£54** (84% decrease) |
| **TOTAL** | **£904/day** | **£70/day** | **-£834/day (92% reduction)** |

**Target ROAS:** 350%+ (profitable only)
**Duration:** 21 days (19th Dec - 8th Jan)
**Total spend:** ~£1,470 over 3 weeks

**Rationale:**
- Last order date: Thursday 18th December
- Sales drop considerably from Saturday 20th (Barry's data)
- Keep campaigns alive vs. complete shutdown (avoids 2024 mistake)
- Capture any late orders (Barry stays open except Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Day)

---

### **Phase 2: Jan 9-15 (Restart)**

| Campaign | Current | New | Change |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| **PMax Generic** | £60/day | £130/day | **+£70** |
| **Search Brand** | £10/day | £20/day | **+£10** |
| **TOTAL** | **£70/day** | **£150/day** | **+£80/day** |

**Rationale:**
- As agreed: "Start £150/day initially in early January"
- No learning period (campaigns never stopped)
- Monitor performance for 7 days before next increase

---

### **Phase 3: Jan 16-22 (Ramp Up)**

| Campaign | Current | New | Change |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| **PMax Generic** | £130/day | £230/day | **+£100** |
| **Search Brand** | £20/day | £30/day | **+£10** |
| **TOTAL** | **£150/day** | **£260/day** | **+£110/day** |

**Condition:** Only if Phase 2 performance is strong (ROAS >300%, stable conversions)

**Rationale:**
- "Scale based on performance" (your agreement with Barry)
- £260/day = historical Q4 target from November

---

### **Phase 4: Jan 23+ (Normal Trading)**

| Campaign | Current | New | Change |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| **PMax Generic** | £230/day | £320/day | **+£90** |
| **Search Brand** | £30/day | £40/day | **+£10** |
| **TOTAL** | **£260/day** | **£360/day** | **+£100/day** |

**Rationale:**
- Return to normal post-Christmas trading levels
- Still below October peak (£904/day)
- Monitor and adjust based on demand

- Target ROAS: 350%+
- Expected revenue: £5,145 (£245/day avg)
- Net profit: £3,675

### **Comparison to 2024:**

   - £60-80/day target = ✅ £70/day actual
   - Keep campaigns alive = ✅
   - Gradual January ramp = ✅

2. **Avoids 2024 Shutdown Mistake**
   - 2024: 37-day shutdown, painful restart
   - 2025: Campaigns never stop, seamless transition

3. **Profitable Throughout**
   - 350%+ ROAS target = £3.50 revenue per £1 spent
   - Only capturing genuinely profitable traffic

4. **Smart Bidding Compatible**
   - No learning periods triggered
