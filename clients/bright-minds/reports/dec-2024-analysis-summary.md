## Campaign Structure Analysis

### Active Campaigns (Dec 2024):

**6 total campaigns had spend:**

1. **BMI | P Max | Generic** (ENABLED)
   - Primary active campaign
   - Average daily spend: ~£220

2. **Sales-Performance Max-RS-AW-24** (PAUSED)
   - Still spending despite being paused
   - Average daily spend: ~£320
   - **HIGHEST spender** in December

3. **Sales-Performance RS-Max-14 SCIENCE** (PAUSED)

### Critical Observation:

**5 out of 6 campaigns were PAUSED but still spending.**

This indicates:
- Campaigns were paused but had remaining budget/activity
- The "paused" campaigns collectively spent ~£420/day vs £220/day for the "enabled" campaign
- Need to investigate if this was intentional (paused for new year) or a configuration issue

## Key Insights for Christmas 2025 Planning

### 1. **Headroom Analysis**

**Question:** Could Bright Minds have spent more in December 2024?

**Evidence suggesting YES:**
- Consistent high ROAS (10x+) suggests demand exceeded supply
- 35% conversion rate indicates strong intent
- No budget exhaustion visible in daily patterns
- Even on "worst" days, ROAS was 7.5x+

**Conservative estimate:** Could have increased spend 30-50% while maintaining 8x+ ROAS

**Calculation:**
- Current spend: £12,279 → Revenue: £128,085
- +30% spend: £15,963 → Est. revenue at 8x ROAS: £127,704
- +50% spend: £18,419 → Est. revenue at 8x ROAS: £147,352

### 2. **Optimal Last Order Date Strategy**

**Dec 20, 2024 was the cut-off:**
- Spend dropped from £657 (Dec 19) to £199 (Dec 20)
- This represents ~£450/day of lost opportunity

**Recommendation for 2025:**
- Maintain full spend until Dec 22-23 (closer to Christmas)
- Modern logistics can handle later cut-offs
- Each extra day = ~£5,000-7,000 additional revenue

### 3. **ROAS Target Setting**

**Current performance (Dec 2024):** 10.43x ROAS

**For Christmas 2025:**
- **Conservative target:** 8.0x ROAS (allows for increased spend)
- **Moderate target:** 9.0x ROAS (maintains profitability)
- **Stretch target:** 10.0x ROAS (match 2024)

**Strategy:** Prioritize revenue growth over ROAS maintenance
- Increasing spend by 40% while achieving 8x ROAS = 10% more revenue than 2024
- Better to capture market share than leave money on the table

### 4. **Campaign Structure Recommendations**

**Issue:** 5 paused campaigns still spending

**Actions needed:**
1. Review why paused campaigns were active
2. Consolidate into fewer, better-optimized campaigns
3. Ensure budget allocation aligns with campaign status
