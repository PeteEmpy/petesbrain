   - 'Brightminds GA4 (web) purchase' = ACCURATE e-commerce tracking
   - 'Add to basket' = Page load tracking (over-reporting)
   - 'Begin checkout' = Page load tracking (over-reporting)

2. ACCURATE Dec 2024 baseline (GA4 only):
   - Conversions: 3469.80
   - Revenue: £122,073.35
   - Spend: £12,279.17
   - ROAS: 9.94 (994%)
   - AOV: £35.18
