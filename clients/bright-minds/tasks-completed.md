## Bright Minds: Reduce Search Brand Campaign Target ROAS to 550%
**Completed:** 2025-11-20
**Source:** Manual completion (reported in Claude Code)

**Campaign:** BMI | Search | Brand (ID: 2083618047)
**Change:** Target ROAS reduced from 800% to 550%
**Campaign Renamed:** "BMI | Search | Brand 550 20/11"

**Why:** Following Campaign Audit recommendation #3 (HIGH priority). Previous target of 800% was unrealistically aggressive - campaign was achieving 510.4% actual ROAS, creating a 289.6pp gap. The high target was likely limiting bid competitiveness and reducing conversion volume potential.

**Context:**
- Previous target: 800% (8.0)
- Actual performance: 510.4% ROAS
- Audit recommendation: Reduce to 600-650%
- User decision: 550% (slightly more aggressive than recommendation)
- Current impression share: 91.8% (good, but may increase with lower target)

**Expected Impact:**
- Increased conversion volume (+20-40% conversions expected)
- Maintained ROAS >500% (still highly profitable vs 400% account target)
- Possible increased spend (+£15-30/day if volume grows)
- More competitive bidding on brand search terms

**Implementation Details:**
- Bid strategy: Maximize Conversion Value (unchanged)
- New target ROAS: 5.5 (550%)
- Daily budget: £23 (unchanged - may need increase if volume grows)
- Learning period: 14 days typical for target ROAS changes

**Review Date:** Wednesday, December 4, 2025 (14 days post-change)

**Success Criteria:**
- Conversion volume increases 20-40%
- ROAS maintains above 500%
- Impression share maintains or improves from 91.8%
- No significant drop in conversion quality

**Monitoring Plan:**
- Week 1 (Nov 20-27): Watch for initial bid adjustment, conversion volume changes
- Week 2 (Nov 27-Dec 4): Assess learning period stabilisation, ROAS performance
- Dec 4 review: Evaluate success, determine if further adjustments needed

**Note:** Change made during Black Friday week (Nov 25-29), so performance data will be mixed with holiday shopping patterns. Will need to separate baseline improvement from seasonal effects in Dec 4 review.

**Completed:** 2025-12-12 15:23
**Source:** Manual

Review impact of target ROAS reduction from 800% to 550% (changed Nov 20, 2025).

**What to check:**
- Conversion volume change (expect +20-40%)
- ROAS performance (should maintain 500%+)
- Impression share (should maintain or improve from 91.8%)
- Spend changes (may increase £15-30/day)

**Context:**

- New target: 550% (more achievable)
- Actual pre-change ROAS: 510.4%
- Learning period: 14 days (Nov 20 - Dec 4)
