  - Generated £1,735 extra revenue above seasonal baseline
  - Learning phase: Campaigns optimizing toward 400% ROAS target

---

## Client Preferences & Communication

### Communication Style
- **Preferred Update Frequency**: **Weekly reports every Monday** (required)
- **Preferred Format**: Email updates with clear, concise explanations (copy-paste ready)
- **Detail Level**: Data-driven with context - clients appreciate:
  - Comparison to seasonal baselines (not just raw YoY)
  - ROI calculations (£ back for every £1 spent)
  - Clear explanations of what's expected vs. what's happening
  - Reassurance during learning phases when ROAS hasn't reached target yet
  - Week-over-week performance trends (last 3-4 weeks)
  - Year-over-year comparisons (same week last year)
  - Trajectory analysis toward seasonal goals (especially Christmas)

### Weekly Reporting Requirements (Mondays)
- **Recipient**: Barry Ricketts (owner) and Sharon (technical lead)
- **Format**: **SIMPLE & CONCISE** (3-4 sentences max)
  - Revenue, Ad Spend, ROAS for the week (one line)
  - 1-2 sentences explaining what's happening (trend, issues, progress)
  - Brief closing ("All looking good" or "Keeping an eye on [X]")
  - **NO detailed analysis** - Barry wants quick updates, not reports
- **Rationale**: Client is cautious about spend due to poor previous agency performance
  - Needs weekly reassurance that Google Ads is delivering results
  - Building trust through consistent, transparent reporting
  - Critical during Christmas ramp-up period (peak season for educational toys)
- **Template Example** (Nov 2025 - Q4 Budget Increase Context):

```
Subject: Bright Minds - Last Week's Performance

Hi Barry,

Quick update on last week:

**Last 7 Days (Oct 27 - Nov 2):**
- Revenue: £3,733 (+45% vs previous week)
- Spend: £1,235 (+42%)
- ROAS: 302% (improving toward 400% target)

As we head into Q4, we'll be gradually increasing budget to capture the Christmas demand - looking at around £260/day to maximize this peak period. ROAS is trending the right way (up from 260% last week), so the system's learning well. I'll keep the weekly updates coming so you can see exactly what's happening.

All looking good.

Best,
Peter
```

**Budget Increase Context (Q4 2025)**:
- Target daily budget: £260/day (approx £1,820/week) for Q4 peak period
- Approach: Gradual increases, monitored closely with weekly updates
- Justification: Christmas is peak season for educational toys, strong ROAS trajectory (260% → 302% week-on-week)
- Previous discussion: Budget increases for Q4 have been mentioned; this justifies the increases with performance data
- Tone: Gentle and transparent - "we'll be gradually increasing" not "we need to increase immediately"

### Decision-Making
- **Primary Owner**: Barry Ricketts (business owner, final authority)
- **Technical Contact**: Sharon (more technically capable, handles day-to-day)
- **Who Makes Final Decisions**: Barry & Sharon (joint decision makers)
- **Approval Process**: Both contacts included on key communications
- **Risk Tolerance**: **Cautious** - previous agency didn't deliver results
  - Needs clear evidence of performance to maintain confidence
  - Weekly reporting critical to building trust
  - Willing to invest when data supports it (demonstrated by Oct restructure)

### Red Flags / Sensitive Topics
- **Previous agency performance concerns**: Client cautious due to poor past results
- **Spend anxiety**: Needs weekly reassurance that ad spend is generating returns
- **Increased ad spend anxiety**: Per Oct 22 email: "I know the increased spend can feel uncomfortable when you're not seeing the full return yet"
- **Important**: Always frame spend increases with ROI context and timeline expectations
- **Preferred approach**: Transparent communication with clear data showing performance trajectory
- **Trust-building**: Weekly reports are critical to maintaining client confidence

## Campaign-Specific Notes

### Performance Max Campaign - Generic
**Campaign:** BMI | P Max | Generic (ID: 21064167535)
- **Purpose**: Primary revenue driver for e-commerce (92% of spend)
- **Current Bid Strategy**: Maximize Conversion Value, Target ROAS 330%
- **Daily Budget**: £300
- **Performance Notes** (as of Nov 20, 2025):
  - ROAS: 346.6% (exceeding 330% target by 16.6pp)
  - Conversions: 618.55/month
  - Revenue: £22,090.59/month
  - Budget constraint: Losing 18% impression share to budget
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Post-restructure (Oct 8): Learning phase complete, now stable
  - Budget constrained - needs increase to capture lost impression share
  - Product Hero integration critical for feed quality
  - Target ROAS recently increased from 310% to 330% on Nov 17

### Search Brand Campaign
**Campaign:** BMI | Search | Brand 550 20/11 (ID: 2083618047)
- **Purpose**: Capture high-intent brand search traffic (8% of spend)
- **Current Bid Strategy**: Maximize Conversion Value, Target ROAS 550% (changed Nov 20, 2025)
- **Daily Budget**: £23
- **Performance Notes** (as of Nov 20, 2025):
  - ROAS: 510.4% (strong, but below previous 800% target)
  - Conversions: 61.90/month
  - Revenue: £2,826.92/month
  - Impression share: 91.8% (excellent brand coverage)
  - CTR: 35.28% (indicates strong brand recognition)
- **Target ROAS History**:
  - Previous: 800% (unrealistically high, limiting volume)
  - Changed to: 550% on Nov 20, 2025
  - Reason: Previous target was 289.6pp above actual performance, likely limiting bid competitiveness
  - Expected impact: +20-40% conversion volume, maintained 500%+ ROAS
  - Review date: Dec 4, 2025 (14-day learning period)
- **Special Considerations**:
  - High CTR (35.28%) shows strong brand awareness
  - Search Partners disabled (correct for brand campaigns)
  - No budget constraints (0% Lost IS Budget)
  - May need budget increase if volume grows after target reduction

---

## Product Hero Settings

### Current Configuration (Last Updated: 2025-11-20)

**Product Hero Plan**: Pro Plan (€30/month)

**Campaign ROAS Targets**:
- **Generic PMax**: 330%
- **Search Brand**: 550%

**Actual ROAS Achieved**:
- **Generic PMax**: 346.6% (+16.6 points above target)
- **Search Brand**: 510.4% (-39.6 points below target)

**Rationale**:
- **Generic PMax**: Target increased from 310% to 330% on Nov 17, 2025. Actual performance exceeding target while budget constrained (losing 18% impression share), suggesting room for budget increase rather than ROAS target increase.
- **Search Brand**: Target reduced from 800% to 550% on Nov 20, 2025. Previous 800% target was unrealistically high (289.6pp above actual performance), likely limiting bid competitiveness. Expected impact: +20-40% conversion volume while maintaining 500%+ ROAS.

**Related Methodology**: [Product Hero Labelizer System](/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain.nosync/roksys/knowledge-base/rok-methodologies/product-hero-labelizer-system.md)

### Settings Change History

| Date | Campaign | Setting | Previous | New | Rationale | Result |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 2025-11-20 | Search Brand | ROAS | 800% | 550% | Previous target 289.6pp above actual, limiting volume | [Monitoring - review Dec 4] Expected: +20-40% conversions |
| 2025-11-17 | Generic PMax | ROAS | 310% | 330% | [TBD] | Actual: 346.6% (+16.6pp), budget constrained |

**Note**: Product Hero automatically classifies products daily as Heroes/Sidekicks/Villains/Zombies based on performance. These labels sync to Google Merchant Center and guide campaign structure. Target ROAS settings control the algorithm's bidding aggressiveness.
