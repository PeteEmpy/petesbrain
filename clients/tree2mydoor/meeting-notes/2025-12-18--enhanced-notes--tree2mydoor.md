- 'Them: Ryan. You see? When will the variant be on for the piece? Rules. As long
  as I can find information for it in the next 10 or 15 minutes. Yeah. So everything''s
  been updated, apart from that pace. Rose bush. So just so that you''re aware, What''s
  going to be happening is we''re going to be testing with that petroles bush in another
  rose bush there are going to be sent out in larger pots. So it''s going to be effectively
  a better quality because better root structure and everything for the rose bush.'
- 'Me: Higher price. Then.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''s going to be slightly higher price for those. We''ll still have
  the 3 liter ones at this stage, but effectively it''s going to be a bit of a test
  to sort of see how they perform and what way we want to do them.'
- 'Me: Okay, so if I. If I set up an experiment to do to test the 5 liter pot against
  the existing 3 liter pot for the app''s roast bush. Right. Okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. And then I''m not sure what the other one is
  or suppliers go up, but it''s another existing variety, but in a larger pot, so
  I''ll confirm that as soon as I know what that is then as well.'
- 'Me: Yeah, no purees, so a little bit of a push on the Christmas ones. Then.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Because the issue with the Christmas, the many Christmas trees, I think
  is blooming wild, are doing a really good job actually on them. And then every certain
  market in the country has got these mini Christmas trees in it. I don''t really
  want you bidding to.'
- 'Me: Well, if he''s not worked up on now, it''s. It''s. There''s no way I could
  escalate it quick enough.'
- 'Them: No, no, no, no.'
- 'Me: To. To make a difference. When''s your last order date?'
- 'Them: It''s Monday morning.'
- 'Me: Monday morning. Okay?'
- 'Them: 11.'
- 'Me: 22nd. Right. So if I. So I dropped the budgets. On. The.'
- 'Them: On Monday.'
- 'Me: 22nd about 9 o''clock then. Right, okay.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, yeah. I mean, we''re taking orders right up until 11. So you
  can maybe do it at 10 o''clock.'
- 'Me: Yeah. It''ll make. I. I''ll drop the budgets at 9 o''clock on Monday morning.
  It''ll. It''ll start to take effect on Tuesday morning. So the sooner the better,
  really. And the amount of traffic there''s going to come through in that short space
  of time is going to make very little. Difference.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s just. It''s just slowing it up quick enough.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: So that we don''t overspend in that sort of dead period between. Whenever it''s
  Christmas. And I don''t presume you have a sale at all. It''s all on Boxing Day.'
- 'Them: No, no. But we''re not. We''re not really going to do too much.'
- 'Me: Okay? No worries.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So, yeah, cool.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: So. So that''s that. And then. But I''ll kit. I''ll keep you up to date and
  then if you want to have a catch up, maybe at the end of the week or on Monday.
  Just to, you know, to wrap in the top, we can do, but just feel the feeder reach
  out if, you know, if you get any questions or anything. But it''s going to be. But
  Monday, late morning is when we just. That''s off sort of finish then with dispatches
  and orders and stuff.'
- 'Me: All right, Have a look at the performance from last year, then to see when
  to wind it back up again. Are you. Are you shutting down, or are you going to be
  in about a Christmas New Year?'
- 'Them: We. We are shutting down until I think most. Most of us are going to be,
  including me. Has taken the first Friday or Friday second. So we''re going to be
  buying in Monday the 5th.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: But, yeah, we''re. We''re just hoping to just try and build any orders up
  so that there''s a sort of decent amount on that Monday and then after that it''s
  normally dead then for a few weeks.'
- 'Me: Okay, well, I''m. I''m away. From the day after day after Boxing Day. Until.
  I think it is about the 5th, but I''ll have all my gear with me anyway.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: I''m away. I''m at my desk, but I''m away.'
- 'Them: No problem. Am I anywhere? Nice.'
- 'Me: What you''re going to do. We like to go in the camp of amateur and Christmas
  and New Year just to decompress because it''s always stressful time, this, isn''t
  it? So we''ve done Scotland, Louis Dun, Wales. We''re actually going to do Yorkshire
  and Northumberland this time. We''re going to. We''re going. To be in the middle
  of Keel the Forest on New Year''s Eve.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Lovely.'
- 'Me: So just for. Just for a couple of days.'
- 'Them: That''s good for mountain biking up there.'
- 'Me: It is, yes. It''s good for drinking as well, mate.'
- 'Them: Say no more.'
- 'Me: A couple of beers, I think. No, it''s just. It''s just chilling, really. It
  would be. It would be nice to do that. But we''re going to hit, you know, we''re
  going to dent in places like that, which I. I absolutely love. On the on the way
  and Barnard Castle. And the Whitby and that coast. So we''ll be doing more walking.
  I think we''ll have the dog with us. And he''s 14 now, so he''s a bit of a handful,
  to say the least. He can''t. He can''t actually do much.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'

## Strategic Decisions

- Test 5-liter pot rose bushes against existing 3-liter pot variants
- Adjust marketing budgets on Monday morning (22nd) to avoid overspending during post-Christmas period
- Avoid bidding on mini Christmas trees market due to high competition

## Key Learnings

- Christmas market for mini trees is highly competitive
- Larger pot sizes may justify higher pricing due to better root structure
- Post-Christmas period typically has reduced market activity
