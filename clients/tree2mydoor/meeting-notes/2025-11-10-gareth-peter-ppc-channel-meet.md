- 'Them: Good morning, Peter. How are you?'
- 'Me: Hello. Did you go too soon, then?'
- 'Them: Yeah. I will say it''s a manic Monday here, so.'
- 'Me: Same as every Monday, I suppose.'
- 'Them: Yeah. How was your weekend?'
- 'Me: It was good. Yeah, it was good. We had a proper Sunday yesterday, which we''ve
  not had for a while. We''re empty nesters.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So we don''t often have a proper Sunday. So we drove up to Stainth.'
- 'Them: North yorkshire.'
- 'Me: Yes, it is. Yeah. Name? Alan. I know the area quite well because I used to
  help out do with DAV and they used to do all the trips around there.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: So my wife wanted to go to Stain, to Stainford Force, to go and watch the salmon
  jumping up the river because we didn''t see any. We stood there for ages and got
  freezing cold.'
- 'Them: Brian. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But took the dog. We lost the other dog not so long ago.'
- 'Them: All right. I''m sorry to hear about that.'
- 'Me: So we take it. Thank you. We take him out with us now. To places. But he''s
  14. He can''t walk very far. So we went there. He was quite happy. Then went to
  little cafe on the way into Malham that he used to do with dav. Overlooks the valley.
  Absolutely beautiful. He came in, he''s happy as Larry. He was getting biscuits
  and bits of ham from the butcher and all sorts. My wife spent about 50 quid because
  of that. So he did his job well. And then we went to Malam Tarn, which is. I''ve
  seen the kids walk around there so many times, I''ve never done it myself. And he
  walked four miles.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s fabulous. Then we came back and had roast beef. Roast beef dinner, and
  sat and watched the Grand Prix. It was fantastic.'
- 'Them: Y. Ep. Yeah, lovely.'
- 'Me: Proper relaxing day. And you proper tired from it as well? Just from the fresh
  air. Enjoyed it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. That''s good. You feel like you''re living, you''re
  alive when you. You know, when you''re.'
- 'Me: Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. Definitely. I''m a pain in the ass because I just
  need to be outside. But I''m not working. I go for a walk every morning now every
  single morning I go for 2 1/2 mile walk down the road.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Because I told you up. So I do know. You do?'
- 'Me: I''ll be doing it for nine months. Something like that.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, it''s. It''s good. You know what''s nice about it?
  It''s just seeing all the little subtle changes with the seasons, just as you know.
  You know, if you walked. Yeah. I mean, like, just. Yeah, just warring every. It''s.
  There''s just something really nice about it, you know, and it''d be good if you
  were walking to work, but instead of walking for the sake of walking, you know?'
- 'Me: Well, yeah. But that kind of adds to it as well. I listen to a podcast as I''m
  walking around.'
- 'Them: Oh, you''re right. Yeah.'
- 'Me: On a variant. It might be on health, it might be on money, it might be on work
  and just Indigo. I''m aware of what''s going on around me. I wouldn''t do it if
  I was going. If it was hiking or something like, I definitely wouldn''t wear headphones,
  but it''s. Spot on when you do the same route every day.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But, yeah, Buzzy, I do a little bit of yoga before I set off as well.'
- 'Them: Yes.'
- 'Me: It''s a nice way to start the day. And you''re on it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: You''re on it. Ready to roll. So I am ready to roll.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I. I didn''t have my walk today, so I''m sort of like.
  I think that''s. That''s the problem when the kids are off. I. I started really
  early this morning and then. But I tend to find if I start really early, I don''t
  do me walk. If I do me walk. And then, you know, it''s in that space, you know?'
- 'Me: Peter. Habit, isn''t it? It''s that habit. I''m like an automaton in the morning
  as soon as my feet touch the floor.'
- 'Them: But. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I have a pee. I do my yoga, and I do it in a bedroom. It''s like 10, 15 minutes
  yoga. Same exercises all the time. And then I come downstairs and go up for a walk.
  And it''s a flow, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: If you interrupt that, you buggered.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Exactly. So right. So right. Well, I''ve got a good bit to get through,
  but basically you say where I''m at. I''ll just explain. So basically, Calaber,
  I''m hoping that by the end of quarter one next year that we''re going to be in
  a position where we will be looking at. Hopefully we will have taken another brand
  on. Now, if we are going to be doing that.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: We need to really upgrade them with regard to how we''re operating really
  at the minute. Because essentially, even though everything is being done through
  collabor, we are still sort of thinking, my door heads on and low from speaking
  to you. It''s exactly the same, you know, because you''re just. You just see. Me
  as treated. Well, I am the treat of my door man. But essentially all of. All of
  the meaningful work is actually being done through collabor. And it''s been done
  in a way, I suppose, that systemizes and procedures as much as possible as it would
  do in any agency, just really so that. So that there''s if there''s any repetitive
  tasks that they''re done in the way so that it doesn''t take, you know, any time
  at all to do it again, then the next time. So, Sensei, that''s what I''m doing,
  so I''m doing this. With SEO, I''m doing it with merchandising. All different. Everything
  that it takes to run away with a website, essentially, I''m sort of putting it all
  together and then just like saying, right, is the way that we''re working at the
  minute going to work easily? You know, if we take another brand? Or essentially,
  that''s a question that I''m asking for everything how we''re doing business everywhere
  now. A lot of our operations is now managed by a system that we''ve got called Collaborate
  Connect, which has been a year old next month, so it''s nearly 12 months old. And
  it is literally bees knees for everything that operations. And a lot of that has
  been me, MD and my brain into the system. So that instead of me having to be Yoda
  for the freedom idea operations, that the system can be it and, you know, and then
  I can focus on really, you know, lock myself away for a month and coming up with
  ideas and then coming out to everybody. You know what? And that''s really where
  I might be itself, and that''s essentially where I''m at, you know, with that. What
  I did there a couple of weeks ago was really just empty my head and chat gbt, you
  know, about, like, look, you know, we need to do. And we''re just focusing on the
  paperclick, saying we need to get better, you know, this. I need to know what''s
  going on at the minute. I don''t know what''s going on, and obviously it just spat
  out. Doubly. I''ll just send it over to you and hopefully you''ll just reply back
  and I''ll just put it all back in again and then it''s a starting point. But when
  I had a read over all of that as well, I just thought, actually, I don''t understand
  it. And if I''m being the brand, if me or somebody else on my team has been the
  brown liaison between you and who the brand is, I''m just like, well, actually,
  we need to understand what it is on a very top level way. We need to have clear
  reporting, but then also just have a couple of sentences about. Right. Yeah. The
  main things that were tweaked over the past four weeks were this, this, and this.
  And then I think we definitely need a sort of big matt if there''s a big push on
  the actual product through Merchant Center, Google Merchant Center. We need to really
  just be keeping tabs on which ones are performing, which ones aren''t actually in
  that. And obviously we''ve both got eyes on that. But I think we need to be looking
  at the CM table and then the cm. What''s the word I''m after? Analysis is happening
  in that table each month, so that it''s almost like football scores. Premier Division,
  first Division, second Division, third Division. And I know you''re sort of set
  up like that, but I think what we need to just is that''s going to be mega useful
  to communicate back to anybody else and that''s. The type of thing that I think
  we need to be looking at. I think with the reporting that you''ve updated the email
  report, and I think that''s fairly decent, and I think I''ve emailed back already
  about this, but I think really it''s just about these other ets and Bobs, so. Did
  you see the agenda that''s on the. Touch? No. Right. Just bear a second. I''ll just
  share this. No. So. Yeah, I''ll just. Can you see that? Ok.'
- 'Me: Yep.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Sorry. All right, so basically, just thinking general overview, performance
  and important framework again. I''ve used chat GPT to help just strengthen this,
  you know, to put this out. But I think, you know, between us, we could probably
  just rattle through. But the main reason for me doing this because I will end up
  just talking a lot. Of you know a lot.'
- 'Me: Can I tell you where I''m up to?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because at the end of the day, we''re totally aligned. We''re in a position
  here where we have this wonderful tool in front of us that lets us analyze what
  we''ve got.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Reports on it. And helps us make decisions going forward on in this case, on
  ppc. I''m currently. Could you just excuse me one second?'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Sorry, mate. That was a collection. I needed to grab that.'
- 'Them: All right.'
- 'Me: Yeah. So I''m in a position at the moment where I''m creating what''s called
  the Self Improving Agency.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it''s gone. Out of breath now run upstairs. Is that what this morning''s
  actually knocking me out? So the Self Improving Agency is where? Obviously, I''ve
  got a number of different clients.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And I create projects for each one of those clients, which. It''s funny with
  using chat GPT. You can''t do it in chat GPT, but you can. I use Claude a lot. Because
  I can plumb straight into Google Ads, Analytics, Shopify, I can look at all, pull
  all that data from it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: So the self improving agency is about exactly what you just said is doing the
  brain dump. Of that particular client for me. You know, things like this. What''s
  the strategy? Well, it''s fairly similar to everywhere else, but you''re using profit
  metrics, and I don''t use profit metrics in any other client. But also doing things
  like, I should have told you. I''m actually recording this now, as you probably
  are. Just doing a summary of the call afterwards, and then I upload that into the
  project as well.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: As one big document and just append it all on. I''m doing things like for any
  changes I make on your account now, they all go into a spreadsheet. So when I''m
  doing the analysis at the end of the month,'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It pulls that data in. So go and analyze it. But bear this in mind that this
  is what happened during the month.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Things are moving so quickly, aren''t they? I''ve got something that actually
  looks at your products every day and if there''s a change, it notes that there''s
  been a change to the product. The price might have changed, the title might change,
  the status quo change.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: How did that impact it? So it''s going to look at all those things. So there''s
  a lot more detail coming in. And it''s like with you, it''s evolving.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: We''re not going to get all this stuff all at the same time.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: But it is gradually evolving so I can get more and more detail. But I think
  the trick for both of us is to surface the outliers more than anything else.'
- 'Them: Absolutely.'
- 'Me: Because we get.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Because on our side. That we''ve been doing. Say, for example,
  you know, like on the website. I don''t know if you''ve been on here, but really.'
- 'Me: Nice. Now.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but your story page is really. You know, focusing. It''s me and my
  granddad, you know, that''s when I was a little boy, you know, so really, it''s.
  It''s literally telling the proper story about the business. You know, we''ve got
  the actual brand nigh. You know, it does have its own voice, which, you know. Prior
  to that. Sometimes it was my version of its voice, sometimes it was, you know, or
  whoever the member of staff was. But now, you know, it''s written in a way that
  is just completely, just spot on, you know, and.'
- 'Me: That''s why I use this as a basis for the ads. So when you say to me.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: About the ad text and everything. I do that anyway. I look at the website and
  look at the terminology, tone of voice and so on. But also adding what I add to
  that is my own data. About the best way to write an ad. And I started when I''m
  writing that, I started with 50 headlines, and I go through and select the ones
  that I actually want. But I''ve set the criteria to create those headlines. As we''re
  saying the other day, I''ve done all that.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve created that database, if you like, of and it''s a constantly evolving
  one as well. But it''s going to look at the website and create ad text and it makes
  sure it doesn''t grate. When you go between the two of them, you click on the app,
  it looks the same.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, but I think what the issue is that we have been updating some
  pages and some products on the website and then just not updating others. So they''re
  definitely will be.'
- 'Me: Yeah, but it''s not granular. Seriously, it''s not that granular. Because you
  look at something. Well, that''s not the tone of voice of the website. Yeah, but
  it may be taken consideration a marketing terminology or call to action. You might
  won''t be as pushy on the website as you would be in an ad. Because I want someone
  to click on it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: So it has to take all that into consideration. Otherwise, they''re all not
  the same.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, I haven''t had a chance to go through the ad
  text yet because last two weeks of just the wez by and it has been pretty. Bloody
  hell. What''s happening? But we are on top of when this is about same year for us
  to do this sort of work as well. A hobby that we''re doing tonight anyway. But what
  I''m going to do is run through or brand Voice AI through that spreadsheet and see
  what it says and then sort of look before and after and see what actually looks
  like.'
- 'Me: Do you have a text file with your brand voice in it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. But it''s like. A lot of pages or something, or 100.'
- 'Me: Took it over. I''ll plug it into Claude.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I can use that, because this is exactly it. Is it specific, then, to you? I
  can plug that into Claude. And it''ll always use that when it''s doing any sort
  of correspondence with you or is doing any sort of analysis. We''ll bear that in
  mind.'
- 'Them: Well, I just need to work out how we''re going to, because I''m going to
  be getting a Claude myself as well. But what I don''t want to be doing because the
  minute I''m the only one that can access that document, so I''m literally guarding
  it. But what I''m doing is sharing the GPT that the documents are part of. But then
  it may be that we don''t use chat gbt, that we use Claude going forward or something
  like that.'
- 'Me: The general advice is to just head to your bets at the moment.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Don''t necessarily put all your money on one horse. Claude''s better
  for me because it uses this MCP I can look at. I can plumb straight into Google
  Ads. And I like the project part of it. But like with that document, if you share
  it with me, I don''t need the whole document. Just share it, man. I''ll just plummet
  into that project.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then it will carry on using. That''ll be fantastic, though, if you could
  do that. Really good.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. Well, that. Well, that''s the. But the issue
  is that there''s version of it. So, like, in the last six months, there''s been
  three or four versions.'
- 'Me: But if you look at that document, it will always, as we say, if you share it,
  if you update it, it''ll always take into consideration the latest iteration version.'
- 'Them: I''m still not even sharing properly via drive. Or do you find that''s useful?
  You know, yeah.'
- 'Me: Definitely. The only thing that it''s not very good at is pulling G sheets
  in it. Can''t really do G sheets yet. And to get Google Ads analytics, I could do
  with some more access to Shopify. To do some more analysis on it. And if you''re
  okay with that, because what it does is it connects. But I need access at your end.
  I need you to give me permission to particularly bit. I don''t know which bit it
  is, but then I can look at the overall picture. And see how Google Ads fits into
  it. So if I do that, what it''s going to do is I''m going to go into Shopify and
  I''ll just request access. It''ll come through to you, then you can look at it and
  see whether you want to share that or not.'
- 'Them: Yeah, well, I think. What. Really, we''re. We''re what? My. What were my
  heads at is that I. I''m trying to build up. Like sort of data hubs that collaborate,
  manages, you know, the way you want to manage, you know, ourselves rather than,
  you know, having other, you know, third party such as yourselves. Like, you know.'
- 'Me: I''ve never understood this, Gareth.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Yeah, but you''ve asked me to do analysis on this, and the analysis is Google
  Ads, analytics and Shopify.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: I can''t even see your audio details. It''d be nice on one day. I do it with
  other clients. I go and look at an audience. I wonder what they''ve ordered. Oh,
  right. That seems to be working. So it''s like a real time. Literally just pulling
  raw data from it.'
- 'Them: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, like, we. We can. We can have a look at that. But
  what. What? I.'
- 'Me: But you''re not going to do it.'
- 'Them: ''m. Well, I mean, I. I don''t have an appetite to do it, I think. Really.
  What?'
- 'Me: From my perspective, it''s like you don''t trust me.'
- 'Them: No, no.'
- 'Me: We''re doing this for 10 years. I need to analyze your data, and you''re not
  giving the data to analyze it.'
- 'Them: But. But anytime you''ve asked me to share stuff, I have shared it.'
- 'Me: No. You don''t share stuff in shopify with me. Analytics in there, but I don''t
  have stuff like products. I''m going to look at what collection.'
- 'Them: Just. Just. It''s my turn for the door now. Hello. Thank. You very much.
  So. No, the. I mean, like, really what. What I. But where I''m at and like, you
  know, it''s the same with other apps and things, you know, that. That we. That we
  work with. It''s that important that we. We''re. We''re literally just, you know,
  in control, I think, of. Of the data.'
- 'Me: Well, you are. It''s just Shopify Data. You shared it with me, and if you don''t
  want to carry on sharing it with you to get rid of it, that''s it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. But they. Yeah, so. But I mean, like, really, what. What we''re
  trying to do here is trying to.'
- 'Me: On your Shopify data, it said you''re selling 100 of these every single day.
  And on Google Ads, I''m only selling one. I wouldn''t know that. Extreme case if
  you''re most profitable product or the one you sell the most of. I''m not doing
  a Google Ad for it because in years gone by I didn''t do particularly well and it''s
  just dropped into a bucket somewhere. Why would I not want to revitalize that?'
- 'Them: What? You wouldn''t not want to do that, But I think really.'
- 'Me: I wouldn''t know to do it.'
- 'Them: Well, anyway, I think that this is a separate thing, and what I need to know.'
- 'Me: Gareth. I really don''t.'
- 'Them: Well.'
- 'Me: It''s your daytime.'
- 'Them: Right, so what. What I need to know is what you need, and then I can look
  at it, you know, so.'
- 'Me: I need to get into Shopify to look at the data. That''s it. It does it through
  the mcp.'
- 'Them: Right. Well, I. Well, if. If you just let me know what. What things that
  you need.'
- 'Me: I''ll send. What I''ll do is I''ll go into shopify. And request access, and
  it''ll go through to the admin and it will tell you what it needs to share.'
- 'Them: To. As far as I''m aware, your setup is. A PPC consultant at the minute,
  which we that''s literally has got. So. Yeah, so, I mean, it''s. It''s set up so
  that you can see a number of the apps and. And whatever that you''ve requested previously.
  But then if. If there''s any individual things, I can just change the rule. Because
  the. I think the Shopify rules were introduced there earlier this year or last year
  or something.'
- 'Me: Yes, they were.'
- 'Them: Yeah. And that. So basically that that''s, you know, you''re the only person
  that set up under the pay per click consultant role. So you know that that can.'
- 'Me: What was the name of the. Is it true? To my door. Too, is it? I can''t remember
  the name of the Shopify store.'
- 'Them: Two may endure.'
- 'Me: And it''s a number two.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: There we go.'
- 'Them: But. But I mean, really, where. Where we''re going with collaborators, you
  know, instead of us being like, you know, like a traditional. You know, it''s not
  a traditional agency at all. You know, everything that we''re doing is about. Testims
  and processes and, and repeating and making sure that we''re getting really good.
  Performance, essentially. So. And what. What we''re doing at the Bennett with our
  system is essentially, it''s like a PNL. It''s bringing the PNL into. Into eCommerce.
  So, but all it''s doing at the minute is focusing on the cost of goods. Of products.
  It''s not. It''s not looking at how much money has been spent for the marketing
  of that seal. So that is the next thing that we will be looking at.'
- 'Me: That''s exactly what property batterys does, then.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so. But we, you know, but we want the boot. Bringing that in house
  or full system is unifying and, you know, whether it''s like a pay per consultant
  such as yourself or whether it''s. Our accountant or a bookkeeper or, like a VC
  or whatever. You know, if anyone''s looking at this one system, they''ll look at
  the part of it that means something to them. That actually helps them to, you know,
  to make decisions and to communicate in a way that literally, you know, each of
  these different people are very different from different backgrounds, different
  industries. And, you know, they would say, well, you need to do this. You know,
  in order to improve. But whatever that conversation is will be meaningful to the
  brand owner. And that is what''s going to unlock the doors, because it''ll happen
  quite quickly. But that''s what I''m building up towards. So that''s the reason
  why, you know, I. I''m not Keenan. You know, just sharing, you know, access to LLM,
  access to Shopify. Because we''ve, we''ve worked on getting the. The or sort of
  a fine theme, you know, so that we can access it via LLMs, and we. We can''t. Nobody
  else can at the minute. But what. What we want?'
- 'Me: We like you saying you can''t look at Google Ads data.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but what.'
- 'Me: Still your dating. You can''t bring it in house either.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but we''re. We''re sure. I mean, like, just get, get. You know, all
  this is like bang up today, it really at the minute. But just leave it west me because,
  you know, things will be, you know, improving, you know, as we''re sort of going
  on here.'
- 'Me: Your account will suffer slightly because of that. They don''t have access
  to it.'
- 'Them: But. Yeah. Well.'
- 'Me: Everyone else''s shopify like that. Just been full data the way I want to.
  How is Google Ads performing against the main account?'
- 'Them: If you. You let me know what you want, just. And then we can. We can look
  at it, you know, so.'
- 'Me: Clicked on it and it just sent you an email, and I don''t think there''s anything
  in it. It''s not specifying specifically what it actually needs.'
- 'Them: Right? Yeah.'
- 'Me: What I''ll do is. It''s called go marble ads grader. Is the name of the thing.
  Go, Mark. Let me just. It''s a plugin. This has evolved. It doesn''t do upgrading
  anymore, but they''ve obviously used the same plugin to do this access.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So? Well, I mean, like. Just let. Let. Let me know what, you know,
  what it is that. That you want, and we can. We can look at.'
- 'Me: He''s installed that plugin.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: If you look in the Shopify plugin store, it''ll probably have that knocking
  around in there.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: No, I love this. I love the idea of sharing the information via these individual
  files.'
- 'Them: Okay?'
- 'Me: Where as you say, I''m trying to brain dump as well with my business.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because it is just me.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I actually see in the future, there''s going to be value in this kind of information.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Of course, yeah.'
- 'Me: For you. That''s about your business. I''ve watched a number of videos about
  it where people do a profile and they do the individual departments. HR does this.
  Accounts, does this. Marketing does this, and it explains the way in which things
  are done.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And there''s no ambiguity at all about things because it''s there in black
  and white. Every time you run a chat, in chat, GPT or Claude, it''ll go and look
  at that and go, right, what are you talking about this now? Like that one over there.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And the whole thing with, like, with Google Ads. How do I do a brain dump of
  what I know? Because it changes all the time. Well, I find a way to do that.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve broken down certain things that I do, like creating asset groups and
  Google Ads, text where I want things in a particular way. I want 50 headlines, 50
  description lines, and I want to be able to select the ones that I want, but based
  upon a criteria right at the very beginning. So then there''s five different styles
  of headlines. It might be quirky, it might be cool to actually might be technical.
  Whatever it might be creates tiny of each of those. So I''m with you, mate, yeah.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Absolutely.'
- 'Them: Yeah. So. Well, you know, I think, you know, we''re. We''re doing loads of
  work at the minute, but we''ve. We''ve sort of went back to really like to crunch
  what, you know, who, who treated my daughter is what it''s all about. You know what?'
- 'Me: You put in there. You''ve probably forgotten more than you actually put in
  the document.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: There''s so much to go through, isn''t there?'
- 'Them: There''s a. There''s a massive amount, but, you know, it''s almost like it''s
  a, you know, as. The equivalent of a land rush that we''ve got here at the minute,
  you know, and, like, it''s, you know, effectively what. What you and I are both
  doing is that, you know, we''re. We''re getting our stick, you know, and. And you''re
  going, right, Peter. That''s me and Peter. And. And it''s just like, right?'
- 'Me: Yes.'
- 'Them: All this stuff that I know and the way that I''m doing it, I''m just literally
  laying on the foundations of that gan based on what I already know. And then once
  you''ve. Once you''ve built this, like, palatial mansion, that''s when you want
  to bring.'
- 'Me: Or a behemoth. One or the other.'
- 'Them: Well, let''s. Hopefully it''s the manicured gardens and everything, you know,
  and then you''re inviting then more clients to come in. And, you know, with every,
  with all these extra clamps that are coming in, they''re getting a really good service,
  and it''s not giving you any. It''s. Not giving you a headache or any extra time.
  You know, basically, that''s what I want to do to. To an extent. But with me, it
  is more on, like, right? It''s been an absolute nightmare on my own business for
  the last 22 years. And all of the technical things that it is that has held me back,
  I am now, you know, kidding. The sweet shop. I can be like, right? I can. I can
  do this. I could actually do this now. And, you know, so we''re. You know, the operations
  and the PNL are actually very close to just being like, running, like, really beautifully.
  But then the next thing is that we need to then pull on, you know, the, so marketing
  costs and attribution are next, you know, and what, what I want to be, be doing
  is to build this. System. And that system is going to be my pension, essentially.
  You know, that''s my exit because I think trading my door can just, you know, if
  I lay out it, Oprah, just upright from now to kingdom come, and it would probably
  not make me rich, but I would pay the bills, you know, but really, I want to be
  able to exit. You know?'
- 'Me: Isn''t it funny? You''ll be selling that chat GPT file as part of the exit.
  That''s the real value, isn''t it? People don''t reinvent the wheel.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve got a guy just onboarding now. He''s at ecommerce business, and it''s
  just like he''s never done ecommerce before.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: He should buy from China till he''s blue in the face and beautifully do it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But as far as ecommerce is concerned,'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Really don''t know.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: If you could actually do that and getting people used to using Chat GPT in
  the same way as they do Google.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Go and ask it. I was down in the kitchen before with chat GPT on voice mode,
  just asking it questions about stuff.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Absolutely amazing.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, right? So we''ll. Let''s just have a look at this.
  There. I''m just gonna share this. Are you looking at the. Can you see? The meeting
  notes.'
- 'Me: There we go.'
- 'Them: Are. Right, so. Right? I mean, look. I think, really it''s just sort of knowing
  what. The sort of funnels are really in the business. So that I can then just because,
  see, like with Ryan. So Ryan, who''s working with me, he''s like a graduate. He''s
  had a good, really good grinding in operations, you know, customer service first
  in the business, and then he''s quite good with spreadsheets and he''s a clever
  lad. So, literally, you know, I''m able to, like, say, let go and find out about
  this and you''ll just be able. To do it and AI in a way that''s helping them so
  you can get loads more done. But when it comes to actually me explaining how the
  treaty might work, how it works, you know, I was able to sort of say, right. We''ve
  got Channable on there and we''ve got Profit metrics. And then you''ve got Product
  Hero, but we don''t exactly know how that''s working. But then. And then we''re
  focusing very much on pmax, but then there hasn''t. P.mx and Chopin. But that was
  as much as I could sort of say. And then it sort of made me realize, well, actually,
  you know, we''ve been doing a lot of this work on the brand, but then we haven''t
  been. You and I haven''t been having any communication back and forth about the.
  Brand. We''ve sort of been doing that independently from you. And then obviously
  you''re using our website to get the information, but then we haven''t really had
  that, you know, information about this is what we''re up to, you know. You know,
  on that and sort of almost like sort of saying we''ll. Have a date where we''ll
  catch up and we''ll show you what we''ve done and we''ll give you the information
  whatever way we''re going to give it. So I think that sort of underlines that there''s
  been a two way thing there just about. What''s new on both sides that perhaps, you
  know, we could have been a bit better at, and I think we definitely can be better
  at going forward. And sure. And, you know, and it might be that as well as you sending
  us a monthly summary. We send you a monthly summary, and then if there''s things
  on that, you''re like, well, actually, guys, you know, what, what about this? Because
  then that way you can use that monthly summary to feed into your systems, you know.
  And if anything pops out the other side, you were like, actually, yeah, you know,
  that. That sounds great. You know, and I could. I could really use that.'
- 'Me: It would have been good to know the website have been changed.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I mean, it''s.'
- 'Me: I did a big change, and it coincided exactly with the website. And it absolutely
  tanked.'
- 'Them: Right? Right.'
- 'Me: Because I''d split out the pmax campaign at the time because I noticed the
  conversion rates are down quite dramatically over the last seven days.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The same time as me doing that. We didn''t stand a hope in hell.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Doing? Working, so I''ve reverted it.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Website settled down a little bit.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, like, we''re. We. We have been seeing that the conversion
  rate on the site had really improved last week compared to what it was. But then
  at the weekend there. Well, it''s certainly on Sunday, it was awful. Yesterday.
  You know, I think we had four orders all. All day or something. But prior, you know,
  Saturday was great. Previous, you know, last week.'
- 'Me: Just before I came out, I was looking at analytics. And it says conversions
  are dropped by 32% and conversion rates gone from 3.95 to 2.43 compared with the
  previous week. I reverted what I''d done at the end of last week. As I can see,
  it wasn''t heading the right sort of direction.'
- 'Them: Right, okay.'
- 'Me: It might be case settling from a personal view. The big images on the home
  page do nothing for me.'
- 'Them: Yeah. No. Well, yeah. I mean, the omp is going to be updated.'
- 'Me: Yeah. I look at product pages. Seriously, I love them. Absolutely love them.'
- 'Them: Most of the work''s been put into product and collection and cart. And homepage,
  we''ve kept it the same, but then we''re going to be removing some blocks and replace
  them and new ones, you know, so. Great. Okay, so.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah, Brandon, Copy. So I''m going to be reviewing that. What I''m going
  to do is run. Run that through our brand voice and see what it suggests, or if it''s
  suggest anything.'
- 'Me: I''ll say again, if you can provide your brand voice.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: What you don''t put into that is my skill. It''s my sphere of knowledge, my
  specialism. The best thing you can do as far as that''s concerned is to share the
  document. Just to say, this is our Brown voice and I''ll consideration.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: I''m just trying to save you some time because.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, and I get. I get it. I think I just need to frame it in May
  I. What way I''m going to be using this document? Because at the minute, it sort
  of like, it''s. It''s like the crown jewels. It''s like literally this is everything,
  you know about. But it is just, you know, it''s like a story. You know, how it''s
  done. But anyway, but I. There. There is other things that I will be able to. I.
  I''ll come back to you because I need to get my docs in a row a bit more for this,
  you know, so.'
- 'Me: Ok? I''m the same, to be honest. It''s an evolving landscape at the moment.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s the thing. Whilst we have it in our was, I was a bit off post fall
  the other morning, just going through this kind of stuff and it does piggle your
  head because you go, this is so powerful.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But you could go like that, and there are loads of different directions, but
  it''s just collecting your thoughts first.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah, exactly.'
- 'Me: Can''t. Do, and then it''s going to apply to the business.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it''s all about structure, really, you know, because, you
  know, a few. If you can have an idea about the structure, you know, and, and it
  is at four in the morning that is waking up really early on this, on the Saturday,
  you''ve got stuff in your head and I think, right. That''s really. Good, actually.
  I need to just get that down and share it, you know, And. And it''s those moments
  where you get the. The. The car, the brilliance, that you can then build structure
  around that, and all of a sudden you''ve got something like, see, that''s got real
  value.'
- 'Me: I''ve got a really good tool for you. I don''t know. I mentioned this last
  time to you. Think of Whisper Flow.'
- 'Them: Whisper flow. No.'
- 'Me: Wispr. Flow, flow.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I don''t type very much now. I just talk.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it''s not just a voice to text. It''s an AI voice to text. So, literally,
  on my Mac keyboard here, I just hold down the function key and talk, and no matter
  what text box you''re in, do it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Obviously, the spelling, grammar and all the rest of it will be correct. You
  can go into command mode and say, can you make that a bit clearer? And it will change
  that text no matter where you are.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because all these things have a microphone input.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But this is a uniform one, right across everything. So, like, when you''re
  doing about the business kind of thing, you can just ramble on with it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And then you go back to your afterwards. Can you just make that less gibberish?'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: Make it a bit more structured. I mean, it doesn''t matter if a chat GPT any.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah, yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve got my microphone here all the time.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And just to try and make it as clear as possible when I''m talking.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I don''t know. It does. Ulster or not, though.'
- 'Them: Well, I won''t be using it, then.'
- 'Me: But seriously, it''s like 135 words per minute I can do on that.'
- 'Them: Yeah, we say I''m. I''m much better. Than when I''m not talking. Actually,
  I''m better.'
- 'Me: I. Used to think, though. Yeah, I used to think that. And I''ve changed dramatically
  now.'
- 'Them: Like. Yeah, maybe if, you know, forgetting to the way something. Mate, mate.
  But it''s the wolf. I''m very woefully when I''m speaking, but when I''m thinking,
  I''m not like that at all. So it''s really frustrating for me when I talk, you know,
  because. Brand. I''ll have look over that and we''ll see what a bit what we want
  to do. You know, west there. With about sharing the brand voice with you and what
  we''re going to do that going forward. So.'
- 'Me: As I say, that''s the way you could help me the most is with.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We definitely will be able to.'
- 'Me: Okay? Even if you''re broken down. Bit of it. If there''s just a couple of
  pages with the voice and it doesn''t contain all the rest of the stuff.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Be superb.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I''ll be able to do that.'
- 'Me: Great.'
- 'Them: Visibility, collaboration. So. So, really, I think. You know, as I mentioned
  before, it''s about. I think if we''re. If we can. Because ideally, what. What we
  both need to do is automate as much as possible so that then anytime that we do
  need to talk is really on bang on the money stuff, you know, so. And I think, you
  know, with. Regard to that, then it''s like saying, this is the model that we''re
  working to on the account.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: If there''s going to be any major changes on that, that we just use the chart
  to sort of like say, look, we''re, we''re going to be, you know, we, we should have
  went on said we''re going to be updating the website, you know, the update and the
  theme. We''re going to be doing it here. We''re going to be doing this, we''re going
  to be doing that. And then, you know, on your side you say, right, well, I''ll hold
  off then, you know, But I think really that two way communication is possibly going
  to be a good way to sort that out. Now, also in Google Chat now, there is a way.
  To set it up so that. Let me just say. Do we have a paper collect? Did I set up
  a PaperClick one?'
- 'Me: Is this thing? This is in Google Meet, is it?'
- 'Them: Google. No google chat.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Which is. Yeah, we. We do, actually. So. Yeah, so let. Let me. Yeah, you
  see.'
- 'Me: I never look at this.'
- 'Them: Because at the minutes, and we''re set up in this space and we''re hardly
  using it at all, whereas the other spaces that we''ve got, we''re just using it
  all the time. Now, the benefit, one of the benefits of this. Is that we can go into
  space settings here. And you can look at apps and integrations and you can, you
  can actually have this plugged into your webhook. So if we are chatting regular,
  more regular, this webhook can be plugged into one of your systems so that it absolutely
  knows what we''re talking about all the time.'
- 'Me: Yeah.'
- 'Them: Now.'
- 'Me: The first thing is to actually use it, though. I say I don''t use Google Chat
  for anyone at all.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So I''ve got to get it. So I''ve got that open all the time on my desktop.'
- 'Them: But you see, you see, link in. If you''re in your Gmail, all you have to
  do is show your.'
- 'Me: I don''t use Gmail. I''m on a Mac, so I use another thing so I can pull in
  loads of different email addresses. On it.'
- 'Them: See the. The other. Well, if you prefer to message on phone, then you can
  do it very. The app, the Gmail app on your phone will have the chat is just a bit
  in the middle of it as well, like WhatsApp. But then you can. Yeah, you can do all
  sorts of stuff with it and you know any. Shared documents. You just go into shared.
  And anytime in the past that we shared stuff, you just find them like this. And,
  you know, it just makes things so much easier. If there''s a task, you just, like,
  say, right? I''ll put a task on there for Gareth, you know, because I need them
  to do that for me, and basically that goes under my task list, and I''ll make sure
  I get it done, you know?'
- 'Me: I wonder if I can get it to email me when the chat comes in.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it does. It will do you. That automatically does it. We''ll do it in
  the middle of the night. It''ll say, here''s what you''ve missed.'
- 'Me: Okay?'
- 'Them: Yeah. And they''ve improved at massively, you know, over the last 12 months
  as well. You know, it''s been really good.'
- 'Me: Well, I say I tend to use WhatsApp and Teams for everybody else, but it sounds
  strange. I''ll have to find a way to integrate that into what I''m using at the
  moment.'
- 'Them: Yeah. I mean, like, I''m. I''m sure. I''m sure it''s possible, you know,
  but if you just look at, you know, Google chats, spaces, that''s what you want to
  be looking for. And the Grayson of Google chat spaces into, you know, but you can.
  I think you can. Yeah. You use web hooks to plug it into something that you''re
  already using, that a lot of money just pop in there.'
- 'Me: Yeah. Okay? All right.'
- 'Them: Yeah, so. Yeah, but I think, you know, this is very well set up to integrate
  other things, so I think that''ll be useful, you know, for. For you. Now, one of
  the things that I''m worried about is that there could. Be. I''ve. I''ve got it
  in my head that, you know, with, with some of the performance stuff with the Albert
  pay per click this year. That. It just. It doesn''t seem like normal compared to
  what. What has happened before. And I am worried that.'
- 'Me: This really hasn''t been a normal year.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but I, I, I''m sort of worried that there''s either competitors or
  that their potency could be affiliates who are going mine or back and bidding on
  stuff with, with or knowing.'
- 'Me: You have competitors. Anyway, in every space that I''m working at the moment,
  the competition has gone up.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And that could be Temu, it could be Amazon, whoever. It has gone up. And that''s
  because one of the things with that is the advent of PMAX campaigns and the fact
  that Google are pushing them.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: As being an easy way to get onto Google Ads. And you can tell that because
  you look at impression shares are harder to get and if we do get them, then the
  CPCs have gone up. That is absolutely right across the board that every cpcs have
  gone up this year.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: More than any other year, and that''s for everybody.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: I don''t know whether they''re trying to increase the stock price or I think
  it is just more people are in the space now. And because you''ve got things like.
  So you got things like AI Max on search campaigns, which is expanding it out into
  all these areas, like aio. On Google because you''ve got that. Because there is
  that expansion, you''re starting to overlap with other people as well. More and
  more. You don''t think you''re in your space. Just do normal birthday gifting.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because just try every now and again. Always keep that a go. See whether that
  works or not.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: So that is absolutely a theme.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: For pretty much all my Google Ads accounts this year just to put pressure on
  average CPC.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, like, I think. Yeah, those are the
  main things, really. You know, I think so. You know, we''re not. We are actually
  more aligned, I think, than we thought, I think, you know.'
- 'Me: Definitely. We''re both struggling with it in our own way, aren''t we?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Promised. We''re struggling in the fact of this is a whole new thing to learn,
  really, isn''t it?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Right. We''ll nail it. But we want 500 things all at the same time.'
- 'Them: Yeah, but I do think that we. We do have an advantage because we''ve got
  years of experience that, that we literally can. Yeah, you know, I think we can.
  We can literally use our experience with AI that''s maybe a lot more collaborative
  than maybe somebody that just doesn''t have the level of experience, which. You
  know, when it works, it''s great. You know, when you''re on the flow, it''s brilliant.
  But once. Once you fall down these rabbit holes, it''s like it''s. Yeah, it''s.
  It''s. It''s literally, it''s. It''s. It''s. It feels nice, and you like being in
  there, but then you realize, well, wait a minute, I''m flipping stuck here. You
  know? You know, and it''s like recognizing those Uturns as well, but, you know.'
- 'Me: Just you wait till you get into Claude and you start using skills on Claude.
  Where that''s repeatable actions. So it creates a skill, like an app, almost. You
  just say run that skill for this run. That''s. And it produces some results.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s heavy stuff, really heavy stuff.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: As far as I''m concerned. I think we''re missing the details on LLMs Txt. I
  think that''s a massive opportunity missing out on. It''s something that would take
  an hour to implement and all of a sudden you get a free tracker, free traffic. You''re
  dictating what chat GPT is, actually, well, any LLM is saying about you.'
- 'Them: I think we have implemented one already and we are going to be doing the
  other one. So. So we are going to be doing both of those. Is just literally that.
  I think you sent that over.'
- 'Me: It''s just a question. Great. 10 questions. And it goes and creates the lms
  txt.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Agents txt and the actual prompting has been written by an AI guy.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Is the guy whose training course is a mon at the moment he''s properly switched
  on. So it kind of takes every if but or maybe out of it. If it''s just Those, literally
  those 10 questions, answer them as thoroughly as you can. I can plug it in, it creates
  the LLMs txt and it creates the agents txt as well.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: Which, the way agents look at your site,'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: And it''s amazing. The minute you don''t have to wait for it to crawl the website,
  you load it up into the root directory. You can then go and say to chat GPT tell
  me all about treating my door. Bang.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s all your stuff that appears.'
- 'Them: Right? Right.'
- 'Me: Defaulting to something else, it''s actually saying the right thing.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah.'
- 'Me: And the other thing that''s going to be really important going forward is the
  way Chat GPT are moving into the same space as Google. So Chat GPT the other day
  produced a browser called Atlas. I don''t know you saw it or not. So Atlas is a
  Atlas. It''s built on chrome. It''s built on chromium. But it is. Well, yeah, you
  just ask it questions and it goes and finds stuff out for you because now leads
  into them having a route into a marketplace of paid ads.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because they''re going to do it. They have to.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I don''t know how they''re going to do it, but they will be doing it.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: And we just need to make sure we''re ready for it.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because there will be something similar to Google shopping ads, but I don''t
  know what it''s going to be yet.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But have a play with chat GPT atlas. It''s amazing. It''s so easy.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But they''ve rumbled them. Because if you use the free version of Chat GPT,
  it doesn''t let you do many queries. I mean, I spent $20 a month. It''s well worth
  it. I spent 80. 80 quid a month on Claude.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: Because it''s worth it as a business.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: But as a punter, are you going to spend 20 quid on using a search engine every
  month?'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: The answer to that is probably yes, eventually. Eventually, when they approve
  it. But it''s going to be a little bit way down the line.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: But when the shopping comes, that''s going to be a game changer.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah, absolutely. But, yeah.'
- 'Me: I think we''re ready for it.'
- 'Them: I mean, like, treated my door, you know, it feels like the last 12 months
  I''ve just been, like, banging away, just not getting. And, you know, well, we''re
  getting loads of stuff done, but it does, you know, because the seals haven''t been
  going up and stuff. It''s just feels like we''re mining. You know, when it''s like.
  It''s just not Gran. We''re just, you know, chipping away. So I. I am just hopeful
  that, you know, we will be seeing things.'
- 'Me: You don''t need. Gareth, I would say to you, as trailblazing with your products
  as you are with technology,'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: That''s why I can''t wait for. I can''t believe how excited I got about the
  fact you were going to do a chili plant.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah.'
- 'Me: It''s some new search terms to go out. A new avenue. We''re rinsing these keywords
  at the moment. There''s only so many that apply.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: I''ve switched on AI Max on those search campaigns, which will expand it out
  a little bit more.'
- 'Them: Y. Eah.'
- 'Me: But there''s only so many you can do.'
- 'Them: Yeah.'
- 'Me: We need to be one step ahead of the competition. Really?'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like I said, I honestly think that,
  you know, if anytime that we speak in the future, that if it''s. If it''s.'
- 'Me: I''m not allowed to say that to you. I''m not allowed to say. You need to get
  some old products on the website.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah. But, like, I. I think, you know, we''re. We. We are going to
  be in a really strong place, you know, and I think these trademarked ranges that
  are going to be launching over the next six months. Those, you know, I. I want those
  to be really high end, you know, like price really high and really good quality
  accessories that, you know. You know, beautiful quality accessories that go out
  with the trees and plants so that, you know, like you can imagine seeing it in horrors
  or something like that, you know, when everyone''s queuing. Up for it, you know,
  and have it and, you know, it being an older woman''s magazines. And so that, that''s
  really what I''m going to be aiming at. And I might even be that, you know, some
  of the oak tree gift and things like that that we, we don''t, we just. Literally
  don''t even have them anymore, but they''re as part of a much more design layered
  sort of gifting experience for customers. So. But it''s. It''s tricky because it''s
  like, literally right. You know, if we go really off the wall with it, will people
  get it or not? And can it be marketed through conventional channels in the same
  way that these current things can. But I think if we''re going to do it, we''ll
  be able to do it and, and collaboration with AI because it helps us to just crack
  on in the enormous rate to actually, you know, instead of having these writers block
  moments, it literally just zaps the. The wall so that there''s no block. There anymore,
  you know, so. Yeah.'
- 'Me: Cool.'
- 'Them: Yeah, it''s good, right? So. Okay. So. Well, you. You''ll get the transcript.'
- 'Me: I can''t be up, mate.'
- 'Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You keep your own there. Okay, mine.'
- 'Me: You''re going to be. The summary is a brilliant. You could talk for like, 10
  hours and it''ll come back with about 10 lines or something, you know. That was
  absolutely right on the money. It''s just what you need, isn''t it? It really is.'
- 'Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, as. As indeed. So, yeah. And I think anytime that
  if. Anytime we need to catch up, if we just do it like this so that we''ve got the
  transcript otherwise, honestly, in one ear. Cool. Right. So I''ll be in contact
  with you by. At the very latest, Thursday afternoon, because I''m off tomorrow and
  Wednesday with the kids, and then Thursday and Friday, so. But I. Yeah, I think
  I''ll. I''ll. I''ll meet. I might even be today. You know how long it takes just.
  Run the necessary, the brand voice. So I think. Yeah, but. Cool, right? Well, thanks
  very much for your time, Peter. I''ll speak to you soon.'
- 'Me: All right. Ok? No. Problem. Cheers, guy.'

- -- Full Transcript ---
- Them: Good morning, Peter. How are you?
- Me: Hello. Did you go too soon, then?
- Them: Yeah. I will say it's a manic Monday here, so.
- Me: Same as every Monday, I suppose.
- Them: Yeah. How was your weekend?
- Me: It was good. Yeah, it was good. We had a proper Sunday yesterday, which we've not had for a while. We're empty nesters.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So we don't often have a proper Sunday. So we drove up to Stainth.
- Them: North yorkshire.
- Me: Yes, it is. Yeah. Name? Alan. I know the area quite well because I used to help out do with DAV and they used to do all the trips around there.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Me: So my wife wanted to go to Stain, to Stainford Force, to go and watch the salmon jumping up the river because we didn't see any. We stood there for ages and got freezing cold.
- Them: Brian. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: But took the dog. We lost the other dog not so long ago.
- Them: All right. I'm sorry to hear about that.
- Me: So we take it. Thank you. We take him out with us now. To places. But he's 14. He can't walk very far. So we went there. He was quite happy. Then went to little cafe on the way into Malham that he used to do with dav. Overlooks the valley. Absolutely beautiful. He came in, he's happy as Larry. He was getting biscuits and bits of ham from the butcher and all sorts. My wife spent about 50 quid because of that. So he did his job well. And then we went to Malam Tarn, which is. I've seen the kids walk around there so many times, I've never done it myself. And he walked four miles.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: It's fabulous. Then we came back and had roast beef. Roast beef dinner, and sat and watched the Grand Prix. It was fantastic.
- Them: Y. Ep. Yeah, lovely.
- Me: Proper relaxing day. And you proper tired from it as well? Just from the fresh air. Enjoyed it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. That's good. You feel like you're living, you're alive when you. You know, when you're.
- Me: Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. Definitely. I'm a pain in the ass because I just need to be outside. But I'm not working. I go for a walk every morning now every single morning I go for 2 1/2 mile walk down the road.
- Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Because I told you up. So I do know. You do?
- Me: I'll be doing it for nine months. Something like that.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, it's. It's good. You know what's nice about it? It's just seeing all the little subtle changes with the seasons, just as you know. You know, if you walked. Yeah. I mean, like, just. Yeah, just warring every. It's. There's just something really nice about it, you know, and it'd be good if you were walking to work, but instead of walking for the sake of walking, you know?
- Me: Well, yeah. But that kind of adds to it as well. I listen to a podcast as I'm walking around.
- Them: Oh, you're right. Yeah.
- Me: On a variant. It might be on health, it might be on money, it might be on work and just Indigo. I'm aware of what's going on around me. I wouldn't do it if I was going. If it was hiking or something like, I definitely wouldn't wear headphones, but it's. Spot on when you do the same route every day.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: But, yeah, Buzzy, I do a little bit of yoga before I set off as well.
- Them: Yes.
- Me: It's a nice way to start the day. And you're on it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: You're on it. Ready to roll. So I am ready to roll.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I. I didn't have my walk today, so I'm sort of like. I think that's. That's the problem when the kids are off. I. I started really early this morning and then. But I tend to find if I start really early, I don't do me walk. If I do me walk. And then, you know, it's in that space, you know?
- Me: Peter. Habit, isn't it? It's that habit. I'm like an automaton in the morning as soon as my feet touch the floor.
- Them: But. Yeah.
- Me: I have a pee. I do my yoga, and I do it in a bedroom. It's like 10, 15 minutes yoga. Same exercises all the time. And then I come downstairs and go up for a walk. And it's a flow, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: If you interrupt that, you buggered.
- Them: Yeah. Exactly. So right. So right. Well, I've got a good bit to get through, but basically you say where I'm at. I'll just explain. So basically, Calaber, I'm hoping that by the end of quarter one next year that we're going to be in a position where we will be looking at. Hopefully we will have taken another brand on. Now, if we are going to be doing that.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: We need to really upgrade them with regard to how we're operating really at the minute. Because essentially, even though everything is being done through collabor, we are still sort of thinking, my door heads on and low from speaking to you. It's exactly the same, you know, because you're just. You just see. Me as treated. Well, I am the treat of my door man. But essentially all of. All of the meaningful work is actually being done through collabor. And it's been done in a way, I suppose, that systemizes and procedures as much as possible as it would do in any agency, just really so that. So that there's if there's any repetitive tasks that they're done in the way so that it doesn't take, you know, any time at all to do it again, then the next time. So, Sensei, that's what I'm doing, so I'm doing this. With SEO, I'm doing it with merchandising. All different. Everything that it takes to run away with a website, essentially, I'm sort of putting it all together and then just like saying, right, is the way that we're working at the minute going to work easily? You know, if we take another brand? Or essentially, that's a question that I'm asking for everything how we're doing business everywhere now. A lot of our operations is now managed by a system that we've got called Collaborate Connect, which has been a year old next month, so it's nearly 12 months old. And it is literally bees knees for everything that operations. And a lot of that has been me, MD and my brain into the system. So that instead of me having to be Yoda for the freedom idea operations, that the system can be it and, you know, and then I can focus on really, you know, lock myself away for a month and coming up with ideas and then coming out to everybody. You know what? And that's really where I might be itself, and that's essentially where I'm at, you know, with that. What I did there a couple of weeks ago was really just empty my head and chat gbt, you know, about, like, look, you know, we need to do. And we're just focusing on the paperclick, saying we need to get better, you know, this. I need to know what's going on at the minute. I don't know what's going on, and obviously it just spat out. Doubly. I'll just send it over to you and hopefully you'll just reply back and I'll just put it all back in again and then it's a starting point. But when I had a read over all of that as well, I just thought, actually, I don't understand it. And if I'm being the brand, if me or somebody else on my team has been the brown liaison between you and who the brand is, I'm just like, well, actually, we need to understand what it is on a very top level way. We need to have clear reporting, but then also just have a couple of sentences about. Right. Yeah. The main things that were tweaked over the past four weeks were this, this, and this. And then I think we definitely need a sort of big matt if there's a big push on the actual product through Merchant Center, Google Merchant Center. We need to really just be keeping tabs on which ones are performing, which ones aren't actually in that. And obviously we've both got eyes on that. But I think we need to be looking at the CM table and then the cm. What's the word I'm after? Analysis is happening in that table each month, so that it's almost like football scores. Premier Division, first Division, second Division, third Division. And I know you're sort of set up like that, but I think what we need to just is that's going to be mega useful to communicate back to anybody else and that's. The type of thing that I think we need to be looking at. I think with the reporting that you've updated the email report, and I think that's fairly decent, and I think I've emailed back already about this, but I think really it's just about these other ets and Bobs, so. Did you see the agenda that's on the. Touch? No. Right. Just bear a second. I'll just share this. No. So. Yeah, I'll just. Can you see that? Ok.
- Me: Yep.
- Them: Yeah. Sorry. All right, so basically, just thinking general overview, performance and important framework again. I've used chat GPT to help just strengthen this, you know, to put this out. But I think, you know, between us, we could probably just rattle through. But the main reason for me doing this because I will end up just talking a lot. Of you know a lot.
- Me: Can I tell you where I'm up to?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because at the end of the day, we're totally aligned. We're in a position here where we have this wonderful tool in front of us that lets us analyze what we've got.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Reports on it. And helps us make decisions going forward on in this case, on ppc. I'm currently. Could you just excuse me one second?
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Sorry, mate. That was a collection. I needed to grab that.
- Them: All right.
- Me: Yeah. So I'm in a position at the moment where I'm creating what's called the Self Improving Agency.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it's gone. Out of breath now run upstairs. Is that what this morning's actually knocking me out? So the Self Improving Agency is where? Obviously, I've got a number of different clients.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And I create projects for each one of those clients, which. It's funny with using chat GPT. You can't do it in chat GPT, but you can. I use Claude a lot. Because I can plumb straight into Google Ads, Analytics, Shopify, I can look at all, pull all that data from it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: So the self improving agency is about exactly what you just said is doing the brain dump. Of that particular client for me. You know, things like this. What's the strategy? Well, it's fairly similar to everywhere else, but you're using profit metrics, and I don't use profit metrics in any other client. But also doing things like, I should have told you. I'm actually recording this now, as you probably are. Just doing a summary of the call afterwards, and then I upload that into the project as well.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: As one big document and just append it all on. I'm doing things like for any changes I make on your account now, they all go into a spreadsheet. So when I'm doing the analysis at the end of the month,
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It pulls that data in. So go and analyze it. But bear this in mind that this is what happened during the month.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Things are moving so quickly, aren't they? I've got something that actually looks at your products every day and if there's a change, it notes that there's been a change to the product. The price might have changed, the title might change, the status quo change.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: How did that impact it? So it's going to look at all those things. So there's a lot more detail coming in. And it's like with you, it's evolving.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: We're not going to get all this stuff all at the same time.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: But it is gradually evolving so I can get more and more detail. But I think the trick for both of us is to surface the outliers more than anything else.
- Them: Absolutely.
- Me: Because we get.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Because on our side. That we've been doing. Say, for example, you know, like on the website. I don't know if you've been on here, but really.
- Me: Nice. Now.
- Them: Yeah, but your story page is really. You know, focusing. It's me and my granddad, you know, that's when I was a little boy, you know, so really, it's. It's literally telling the proper story about the business. You know, we've got the actual brand nigh. You know, it does have its own voice, which, you know. Prior to that. Sometimes it was my version of its voice, sometimes it was, you know, or whoever the member of staff was. But now, you know, it's written in a way that is just completely, just spot on, you know, and.
- Me: That's why I use this as a basis for the ads. So when you say to me.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: About the ad text and everything. I do that anyway. I look at the website and look at the terminology, tone of voice and so on. But also adding what I add to that is my own data. About the best way to write an ad. And I started when I'm writing that, I started with 50 headlines, and I go through and select the ones that I actually want. But I've set the criteria to create those headlines. As we're saying the other day, I've done all that.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I've created that database, if you like, of and it's a constantly evolving one as well. But it's going to look at the website and create ad text and it makes sure it doesn't grate. When you go between the two of them, you click on the app, it looks the same.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, but I think what the issue is that we have been updating some pages and some products on the website and then just not updating others. So they're definitely will be.
- Me: Yeah, but it's not granular. Seriously, it's not that granular. Because you look at something. Well, that's not the tone of voice of the website. Yeah, but it may be taken consideration a marketing terminology or call to action. You might won't be as pushy on the website as you would be in an ad. Because I want someone to click on it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Me: So it has to take all that into consideration. Otherwise, they're all not the same.
- Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, I haven't had a chance to go through the ad text yet because last two weeks of just the wez by and it has been pretty. Bloody hell. What's happening? But we are on top of when this is about same year for us to do this sort of work as well. A hobby that we're doing tonight anyway. But what I'm going to do is run through or brand Voice AI through that spreadsheet and see what it says and then sort of look before and after and see what actually looks like.
- Me: Do you have a text file with your brand voice in it?
- Them: Yeah. But it's like. A lot of pages or something, or 100.
- Me: Took it over. I'll plug it into Claude.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I can use that, because this is exactly it. Is it specific, then, to you? I can plug that into Claude. And it'll always use that when it's doing any sort of correspondence with you or is doing any sort of analysis. We'll bear that in mind.
- Them: Well, I just need to work out how we're going to, because I'm going to be getting a Claude myself as well. But what I don't want to be doing because the minute I'm the only one that can access that document, so I'm literally guarding it. But what I'm doing is sharing the GPT that the documents are part of. But then it may be that we don't use chat gbt, that we use Claude going forward or something like that.
- Me: The general advice is to just head to your bets at the moment.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Yeah. Don't necessarily put all your money on one horse. Claude's better for me because it uses this MCP I can look at. I can plumb straight into Google Ads. And I like the project part of it. But like with that document, if you share it with me, I don't need the whole document. Just share it, man. I'll just plummet into that project.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: And then it will carry on using. That'll be fantastic, though, if you could do that. Really good.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. Well, that. Well, that's the. But the issue is that there's version of it. So, like, in the last six months, there's been three or four versions.
- Me: But if you look at that document, it will always, as we say, if you share it, if you update it, it'll always take into consideration the latest iteration version.
- Them: I'm still not even sharing properly via drive. Or do you find that's useful? You know, yeah.
- Me: Definitely. The only thing that it's not very good at is pulling G sheets in it. Can't really do G sheets yet. And to get Google Ads analytics, I could do with some more access to Shopify. To do some more analysis on it. And if you're okay with that, because what it does is it connects. But I need access at your end. I need you to give me permission to particularly bit. I don't know which bit it is, but then I can look at the overall picture. And see how Google Ads fits into it. So if I do that, what it's going to do is I'm going to go into Shopify and I'll just request access. It'll come through to you, then you can look at it and see whether you want to share that or not.
- Them: Yeah, well, I think. What. Really, we're. We're what? My. What were my heads at is that I. I'm trying to build up. Like sort of data hubs that collaborate, manages, you know, the way you want to manage, you know, ourselves rather than, you know, having other, you know, third party such as yourselves. Like, you know.
- Me: I've never understood this, Gareth.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Yeah, but you've asked me to do analysis on this, and the analysis is Google Ads, analytics and Shopify.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: I can't even see your audio details. It'd be nice on one day. I do it with other clients. I go and look at an audience. I wonder what they've ordered. Oh, right. That seems to be working. So it's like a real time. Literally just pulling raw data from it.
- Them: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, like, we. We can. We can have a look at that. But what. What? I.
- Me: But you're not going to do it.
- Them: 'm. Well, I mean, I. I don't have an appetite to do it, I think. Really. What?
- Me: From my perspective, it's like you don't trust me.
- Them: No, no.
- Me: We're doing this for 10 years. I need to analyze your data, and you're not giving the data to analyze it.
- Them: But. But anytime you've asked me to share stuff, I have shared it.
- Me: No. You don't share stuff in shopify with me. Analytics in there, but I don't have stuff like products. I'm going to look at what collection.
- Them: Just. Just. It's my turn for the door now. Hello. Thank. You very much. So. No, the. I mean, like, really what. What I. But where I'm at and like, you know, it's the same with other apps and things, you know, that. That we. That we work with. It's that important that we. We're. We're literally just, you know, in control, I think, of. Of the data.
- Me: Well, you are. It's just Shopify Data. You shared it with me, and if you don't want to carry on sharing it with you to get rid of it, that's it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. But they. Yeah, so. But I mean, like, really, what. What we're trying to do here is trying to.
- Me: On your Shopify data, it said you're selling 100 of these every single day. And on Google Ads, I'm only selling one. I wouldn't know that. Extreme case if you're most profitable product or the one you sell the most of. I'm not doing a Google Ad for it because in years gone by I didn't do particularly well and it's just dropped into a bucket somewhere. Why would I not want to revitalize that?
- Them: What? You wouldn't not want to do that, But I think really.
- Me: I wouldn't know to do it.
- Them: Well, anyway, I think that this is a separate thing, and what I need to know.
- Me: Gareth. I really don't.
- Them: Well.
- Me: It's your daytime.
- Them: Right, so what. What I need to know is what you need, and then I can look at it, you know, so.
- Me: I need to get into Shopify to look at the data. That's it. It does it through the mcp.
- Them: Right. Well, I. Well, if. If you just let me know what. What things that you need.
- Me: I'll send. What I'll do is I'll go into shopify. And request access, and it'll go through to the admin and it will tell you what it needs to share.
- Them: To. As far as I'm aware, your setup is. A PPC consultant at the minute, which we that's literally has got. So. Yeah, so, I mean, it's. It's set up so that you can see a number of the apps and. And whatever that you've requested previously. But then if. If there's any individual things, I can just change the rule. Because the. I think the Shopify rules were introduced there earlier this year or last year or something.
- Me: Yes, they were.
- Them: Yeah. And that. So basically that that's, you know, you're the only person that set up under the pay per click consultant role. So you know that that can.
- Me: What was the name of the. Is it true? To my door. Too, is it? I can't remember the name of the Shopify store.
- Them: Two may endure.
- Me: And it's a number two.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: There we go.
- Them: But. But I mean, really, where. Where we're going with collaborators, you know, instead of us being like, you know, like a traditional. You know, it's not a traditional agency at all. You know, everything that we're doing is about. Testims and processes and, and repeating and making sure that we're getting really good. Performance, essentially. So. And what. What we're doing at the Bennett with our system is essentially, it's like a PNL. It's bringing the PNL into. Into eCommerce. So, but all it's doing at the minute is focusing on the cost of goods. Of products. It's not. It's not looking at how much money has been spent for the marketing of that seal. So that is the next thing that we will be looking at.
- Me: That's exactly what property batterys does, then.
- Them: Yeah, so. But we, you know, but we want the boot. Bringing that in house or full system is unifying and, you know, whether it's like a pay per consultant such as yourself or whether it's. Our accountant or a bookkeeper or, like a VC or whatever. You know, if anyone's looking at this one system, they'll look at the part of it that means something to them. That actually helps them to, you know, to make decisions and to communicate in a way that literally, you know, each of these different people are very different from different backgrounds, different industries. And, you know, they would say, well, you need to do this. You know, in order to improve. But whatever that conversation is will be meaningful to the brand owner. And that is what's going to unlock the doors, because it'll happen quite quickly. But that's what I'm building up towards. So that's the reason why, you know, I. I'm not Keenan. You know, just sharing, you know, access to LLM, access to Shopify. Because we've, we've worked on getting the. The or sort of a fine theme, you know, so that we can access it via LLMs, and we. We can't. Nobody else can at the minute. But what. What we want?
- Me: We like you saying you can't look at Google Ads data.
- Them: Yeah, but what.
- Me: Still your dating. You can't bring it in house either.
- Them: Yeah, but we're. We're sure. I mean, like, just get, get. You know, all this is like bang up today, it really at the minute. But just leave it west me because, you know, things will be, you know, improving, you know, as we're sort of going on here.
- Me: Your account will suffer slightly because of that. They don't have access to it.
- Them: But. Yeah. Well.
- Me: Everyone else's shopify like that. Just been full data the way I want to. How is Google Ads performing against the main account?
- Them: If you. You let me know what you want, just. And then we can. We can look at it, you know, so.
- Me: Clicked on it and it just sent you an email, and I don't think there's anything in it. It's not specifying specifically what it actually needs.
- Them: Right? Yeah.
- Me: What I'll do is. It's called go marble ads grader. Is the name of the thing. Go, Mark. Let me just. It's a plugin. This has evolved. It doesn't do upgrading anymore, but they've obviously used the same plugin to do this access.
- Them: Yeah. So? Well, I mean, like. Just let. Let. Let me know what, you know, what it is that. That you want, and we can. We can look at.
- Me: He's installed that plugin.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: If you look in the Shopify plugin store, it'll probably have that knocking around in there.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: No, I love this. I love the idea of sharing the information via these individual files.
- Them: Okay?
- Me: Where as you say, I'm trying to brain dump as well with my business.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because it is just me.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I actually see in the future, there's going to be value in this kind of information.
- Them: Yeah. Of course, yeah.
- Me: For you. That's about your business. I've watched a number of videos about it where people do a profile and they do the individual departments. HR does this. Accounts, does this. Marketing does this, and it explains the way in which things are done.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And there's no ambiguity at all about things because it's there in black and white. Every time you run a chat, in chat, GPT or Claude, it'll go and look at that and go, right, what are you talking about this now? Like that one over there.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And the whole thing with, like, with Google Ads. How do I do a brain dump of what I know? Because it changes all the time. Well, I find a way to do that.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: I've broken down certain things that I do, like creating asset groups and Google Ads, text where I want things in a particular way. I want 50 headlines, 50 description lines, and I want to be able to select the ones that I want, but based upon a criteria right at the very beginning. So then there's five different styles of headlines. It might be quirky, it might be cool to actually might be technical. Whatever it might be creates tiny of each of those. So I'm with you, mate, yeah.
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: Absolutely.
- Them: Yeah. So. Well, you know, I think, you know, we're. We're doing loads of work at the minute, but we've. We've sort of went back to really like to crunch what, you know, who, who treated my daughter is what it's all about. You know what?
- Me: You put in there. You've probably forgotten more than you actually put in the document.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: There's so much to go through, isn't there?
- Them: There's a. There's a massive amount, but, you know, it's almost like it's a, you know, as. The equivalent of a land rush that we've got here at the minute, you know, and, like, it's, you know, effectively what. What you and I are both doing is that, you know, we're. We're getting our stick, you know, and. And you're going, right, Peter. That's me and Peter. And. And it's just like, right?
- Me: Yes.
- Them: All this stuff that I know and the way that I'm doing it, I'm just literally laying on the foundations of that gan based on what I already know. And then once you've. Once you've built this, like, palatial mansion, that's when you want to bring.
- Me: Or a behemoth. One or the other.
- Them: Well, let's. Hopefully it's the manicured gardens and everything, you know, and then you're inviting then more clients to come in. And, you know, with every, with all these extra clamps that are coming in, they're getting a really good service, and it's not giving you any. It's. Not giving you a headache or any extra time. You know, basically, that's what I want to do to. To an extent. But with me, it is more on, like, right? It's been an absolute nightmare on my own business for the last 22 years. And all of the technical things that it is that has held me back, I am now, you know, kidding. The sweet shop. I can be like, right? I can. I can do this. I could actually do this now. And, you know, so we're. You know, the operations and the PNL are actually very close to just being like, running, like, really beautifully. But then the next thing is that we need to then pull on, you know, the, so marketing costs and attribution are next, you know, and what, what I want to be, be doing is to build this. System. And that system is going to be my pension, essentially. You know, that's my exit because I think trading my door can just, you know, if I lay out it, Oprah, just upright from now to kingdom come, and it would probably not make me rich, but I would pay the bills, you know, but really, I want to be able to exit. You know?
- Me: Isn't it funny? You'll be selling that chat GPT file as part of the exit. That's the real value, isn't it? People don't reinvent the wheel.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I've got a guy just onboarding now. He's at ecommerce business, and it's just like he's never done ecommerce before.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: He should buy from China till he's blue in the face and beautifully do it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: But as far as ecommerce is concerned,
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Really don't know.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: If you could actually do that and getting people used to using Chat GPT in the same way as they do Google.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Go and ask it. I was down in the kitchen before with chat GPT on voice mode, just asking it questions about stuff.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Absolutely amazing.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, right? So we'll. Let's just have a look at this. There. I'm just gonna share this. Are you looking at the. Can you see? The meeting notes.
- Me: There we go.
- Them: Are. Right, so. Right? I mean, look. I think, really it's just sort of knowing what. The sort of funnels are really in the business. So that I can then just because, see, like with Ryan. So Ryan, who's working with me, he's like a graduate. He's had a good, really good grinding in operations, you know, customer service first in the business, and then he's quite good with spreadsheets and he's a clever lad. So, literally, you know, I'm able to, like, say, let go and find out about this and you'll just be able. To do it and AI in a way that's helping them so you can get loads more done. But when it comes to actually me explaining how the treaty might work, how it works, you know, I was able to sort of say, right. We've got Channable on there and we've got Profit metrics. And then you've got Product Hero, but we don't exactly know how that's working. But then. And then we're focusing very much on pmax, but then there hasn't. P.mx and Chopin. But that was as much as I could sort of say. And then it sort of made me realize, well, actually, you know, we've been doing a lot of this work on the brand, but then we haven't been. You and I haven't been having any communication back and forth about the. Brand. We've sort of been doing that independently from you. And then obviously you're using our website to get the information, but then we haven't really had that, you know, information about this is what we're up to, you know. You know, on that and sort of almost like sort of saying we'll. Have a date where we'll catch up and we'll show you what we've done and we'll give you the information whatever way we're going to give it. So I think that sort of underlines that there's been a two way thing there just about. What's new on both sides that perhaps, you know, we could have been a bit better at, and I think we definitely can be better at going forward. And sure. And, you know, and it might be that as well as you sending us a monthly summary. We send you a monthly summary, and then if there's things on that, you're like, well, actually, guys, you know, what, what about this? Because then that way you can use that monthly summary to feed into your systems, you know. And if anything pops out the other side, you were like, actually, yeah, you know, that. That sounds great. You know, and I could. I could really use that.
- Me: It would have been good to know the website have been changed.
- Them: Yeah. I mean, it's.
- Me: I did a big change, and it coincided exactly with the website. And it absolutely tanked.
- Them: Right? Right.
- Me: Because I'd split out the pmax campaign at the time because I noticed the conversion rates are down quite dramatically over the last seven days.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The same time as me doing that. We didn't stand a hope in hell.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Doing? Working, so I've reverted it.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Website settled down a little bit.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, like, we're. We. We have been seeing that the conversion rate on the site had really improved last week compared to what it was. But then at the weekend there. Well, it's certainly on Sunday, it was awful. Yesterday. You know, I think we had four orders all. All day or something. But prior, you know, Saturday was great. Previous, you know, last week.
- Me: Just before I came out, I was looking at analytics. And it says conversions are dropped by 32% and conversion rates gone from 3.95 to 2.43 compared with the previous week. I reverted what I'd done at the end of last week. As I can see, it wasn't heading the right sort of direction.
- Them: Right, okay.
- Me: It might be case settling from a personal view. The big images on the home page do nothing for me.
- Them: Yeah. No. Well, yeah. I mean, the omp is going to be updated.
- Me: Yeah. I look at product pages. Seriously, I love them. Absolutely love them.
- Them: Most of the work's been put into product and collection and cart. And homepage, we've kept it the same, but then we're going to be removing some blocks and replace them and new ones, you know, so. Great. Okay, so.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: Yeah, Brandon, Copy. So I'm going to be reviewing that. What I'm going to do is run. Run that through our brand voice and see what it suggests, or if it's suggest anything.
- Me: I'll say again, if you can provide your brand voice.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: What you don't put into that is my skill. It's my sphere of knowledge, my specialism. The best thing you can do as far as that's concerned is to share the document. Just to say, this is our Brown voice and I'll consideration.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Me: I'm just trying to save you some time because.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, and I get. I get it. I think I just need to frame it in May I. What way I'm going to be using this document? Because at the minute, it sort of like, it's. It's like the crown jewels. It's like literally this is everything, you know about. But it is just, you know, it's like a story. You know, how it's done. But anyway, but I. There. There is other things that I will be able to. I. I'll come back to you because I need to get my docs in a row a bit more for this, you know, so.
- Me: Ok? I'm the same, to be honest. It's an evolving landscape at the moment.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: That's the thing. Whilst we have it in our was, I was a bit off post fall the other morning, just going through this kind of stuff and it does piggle your head because you go, this is so powerful.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But you could go like that, and there are loads of different directions, but it's just collecting your thoughts first.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah, exactly.
- Me: Can't. Do, and then it's going to apply to the business.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's all about structure, really, you know, because, you know, a few. If you can have an idea about the structure, you know, and, and it is at four in the morning that is waking up really early on this, on the Saturday, you've got stuff in your head and I think, right. That's really. Good, actually. I need to just get that down and share it, you know, And. And it's those moments where you get the. The. The car, the brilliance, that you can then build structure around that, and all of a sudden you've got something like, see, that's got real value.
- Me: I've got a really good tool for you. I don't know. I mentioned this last time to you. Think of Whisper Flow.
- Them: Whisper flow. No.
- Me: Wispr. Flow, flow.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I don't type very much now. I just talk.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it's not just a voice to text. It's an AI voice to text. So, literally, on my Mac keyboard here, I just hold down the function key and talk, and no matter what text box you're in, do it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Obviously, the spelling, grammar and all the rest of it will be correct. You can go into command mode and say, can you make that a bit clearer? And it will change that text no matter where you are.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because all these things have a microphone input.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But this is a uniform one, right across everything. So, like, when you're doing about the business kind of thing, you can just ramble on with it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: And then you go back to your afterwards. Can you just make that less gibberish?
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: Make it a bit more structured. I mean, it doesn't matter if a chat GPT any.
- Them: Y. Eah, yeah.
- Me: I've got my microphone here all the time.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And just to try and make it as clear as possible when I'm talking.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I don't know. It does. Ulster or not, though.
- Them: Well, I won't be using it, then.
- Me: But seriously, it's like 135 words per minute I can do on that.
- Them: Yeah, we say I'm. I'm much better. Than when I'm not talking. Actually, I'm better.
- Me: I. Used to think, though. Yeah, I used to think that. And I've changed dramatically now.
- Them: Like. Yeah, maybe if, you know, forgetting to the way something. Mate, mate. But it's the wolf. I'm very woefully when I'm speaking, but when I'm thinking, I'm not like that at all. So it's really frustrating for me when I talk, you know, because. Brand. I'll have look over that and we'll see what a bit what we want to do. You know, west there. With about sharing the brand voice with you and what we're going to do that going forward. So.
- Me: As I say, that's the way you could help me the most is with.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We definitely will be able to.
- Me: Okay? Even if you're broken down. Bit of it. If there's just a couple of pages with the voice and it doesn't contain all the rest of the stuff.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Be superb.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'll be able to do that.
- Me: Great.
- Them: Visibility, collaboration. So. So, really, I think. You know, as I mentioned before, it's about. I think if we're. If we can. Because ideally, what. What we both need to do is automate as much as possible so that then anytime that we do need to talk is really on bang on the money stuff, you know, so. And I think, you know, with. Regard to that, then it's like saying, this is the model that we're working to on the account.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: If there's going to be any major changes on that, that we just use the chart to sort of like say, look, we're, we're going to be, you know, we, we should have went on said we're going to be updating the website, you know, the update and the theme. We're going to be doing it here. We're going to be doing this, we're going to be doing that. And then, you know, on your side you say, right, well, I'll hold off then, you know, But I think really that two way communication is possibly going to be a good way to sort that out. Now, also in Google Chat now, there is a way. To set it up so that. Let me just say. Do we have a paper collect? Did I set up a PaperClick one?
- Me: Is this thing? This is in Google Meet, is it?
- Them: Google. No google chat.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Which is. Yeah, we. We do, actually. So. Yeah, so let. Let me. Yeah, you see.
- Me: I never look at this.
- Them: Because at the minutes, and we're set up in this space and we're hardly using it at all, whereas the other spaces that we've got, we're just using it all the time. Now, the benefit, one of the benefits of this. Is that we can go into space settings here. And you can look at apps and integrations and you can, you can actually have this plugged into your webhook. So if we are chatting regular, more regular, this webhook can be plugged into one of your systems so that it absolutely knows what we're talking about all the time.
- Me: Yeah.
- Them: Now.
- Me: The first thing is to actually use it, though. I say I don't use Google Chat for anyone at all.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So I've got to get it. So I've got that open all the time on my desktop.
- Them: But you see, you see, link in. If you're in your Gmail, all you have to do is show your.
- Me: I don't use Gmail. I'm on a Mac, so I use another thing so I can pull in loads of different email addresses. On it.
- Them: See the. The other. Well, if you prefer to message on phone, then you can do it very. The app, the Gmail app on your phone will have the chat is just a bit in the middle of it as well, like WhatsApp. But then you can. Yeah, you can do all sorts of stuff with it and you know any. Shared documents. You just go into shared. And anytime in the past that we shared stuff, you just find them like this. And, you know, it just makes things so much easier. If there's a task, you just, like, say, right? I'll put a task on there for Gareth, you know, because I need them to do that for me, and basically that goes under my task list, and I'll make sure I get it done, you know?
- Me: I wonder if I can get it to email me when the chat comes in.
- Them: Yeah, it does. It will do you. That automatically does it. We'll do it in the middle of the night. It'll say, here's what you've missed.
- Me: Okay?
- Them: Yeah. And they've improved at massively, you know, over the last 12 months as well. You know, it's been really good.
- Me: Well, I say I tend to use WhatsApp and Teams for everybody else, but it sounds strange. I'll have to find a way to integrate that into what I'm using at the moment.
- Them: Yeah. I mean, like, I'm. I'm sure. I'm sure it's possible, you know, but if you just look at, you know, Google chats, spaces, that's what you want to be looking for. And the Grayson of Google chat spaces into, you know, but you can. I think you can. Yeah. You use web hooks to plug it into something that you're already using, that a lot of money just pop in there.
- Me: Yeah. Okay? All right.
- Them: Yeah, so. Yeah, but I think, you know, this is very well set up to integrate other things, so I think that'll be useful, you know, for. For you. Now, one of the things that I'm worried about is that there could. Be. I've. I've got it in my head that, you know, with, with some of the performance stuff with the Albert pay per click this year. That. It just. It doesn't seem like normal compared to what. What has happened before. And I am worried that.
- Me: This really hasn't been a normal year.
- Them: Yeah, but I, I, I'm sort of worried that there's either competitors or that their potency could be affiliates who are going mine or back and bidding on stuff with, with or knowing.
- Me: You have competitors. Anyway, in every space that I'm working at the moment, the competition has gone up.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And that could be Temu, it could be Amazon, whoever. It has gone up. And that's because one of the things with that is the advent of PMAX campaigns and the fact that Google are pushing them.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: As being an easy way to get onto Google Ads. And you can tell that because you look at impression shares are harder to get and if we do get them, then the CPCs have gone up. That is absolutely right across the board that every cpcs have gone up this year.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: More than any other year, and that's for everybody.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: I don't know whether they're trying to increase the stock price or I think it is just more people are in the space now. And because you've got things like. So you got things like AI Max on search campaigns, which is expanding it out into all these areas, like aio. On Google because you've got that. Because there is that expansion, you're starting to overlap with other people as well. More and more. You don't think you're in your space. Just do normal birthday gifting.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Because just try every now and again. Always keep that a go. See whether that works or not.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: So that is absolutely a theme.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: For pretty much all my Google Ads accounts this year just to put pressure on average CPC.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, like, I think. Yeah, those are the main things, really. You know, I think so. You know, we're not. We are actually more aligned, I think, than we thought, I think, you know.
- Me: Definitely. We're both struggling with it in our own way, aren't we?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Promised. We're struggling in the fact of this is a whole new thing to learn, really, isn't it?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Right. We'll nail it. But we want 500 things all at the same time.
- Them: Yeah, but I do think that we. We do have an advantage because we've got years of experience that, that we literally can. Yeah, you know, I think we can. We can literally use our experience with AI that's maybe a lot more collaborative than maybe somebody that just doesn't have the level of experience, which. You know, when it works, it's great. You know, when you're on the flow, it's brilliant. But once. Once you fall down these rabbit holes, it's like it's. Yeah, it's. It's. It's literally, it's. It's. It's. It feels nice, and you like being in there, but then you realize, well, wait a minute, I'm flipping stuck here. You know? You know, and it's like recognizing those Uturns as well, but, you know.
- Me: Just you wait till you get into Claude and you start using skills on Claude. Where that's repeatable actions. So it creates a skill, like an app, almost. You just say run that skill for this run. That's. And it produces some results.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: It's heavy stuff, really heavy stuff.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: As far as I'm concerned. I think we're missing the details on LLMs Txt. I think that's a massive opportunity missing out on. It's something that would take an hour to implement and all of a sudden you get a free tracker, free traffic. You're dictating what chat GPT is, actually, well, any LLM is saying about you.
- Them: I think we have implemented one already and we are going to be doing the other one. So. So we are going to be doing both of those. Is just literally that. I think you sent that over.
- Me: It's just a question. Great. 10 questions. And it goes and creates the lms txt.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Agents txt and the actual prompting has been written by an AI guy.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Is the guy whose training course is a mon at the moment he's properly switched on. So it kind of takes every if but or maybe out of it. If it's just Those, literally those 10 questions, answer them as thoroughly as you can. I can plug it in, it creates the LLMs txt and it creates the agents txt as well.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Me: Which, the way agents look at your site,
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: And it's amazing. The minute you don't have to wait for it to crawl the website, you load it up into the root directory. You can then go and say to chat GPT tell me all about treating my door. Bang.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: It's all your stuff that appears.
- Them: Right? Right.
- Me: Defaulting to something else, it's actually saying the right thing.
- Them: Yeah, yeah.
- Me: And the other thing that's going to be really important going forward is the way Chat GPT are moving into the same space as Google. So Chat GPT the other day produced a browser called Atlas. I don't know you saw it or not. So Atlas is a Atlas. It's built on chrome. It's built on chromium. But it is. Well, yeah, you just ask it questions and it goes and finds stuff out for you because now leads into them having a route into a marketplace of paid ads.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: Because they're going to do it. They have to.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I don't know how they're going to do it, but they will be doing it.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: And we just need to make sure we're ready for it.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because there will be something similar to Google shopping ads, but I don't know what it's going to be yet.
- Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
- Me: But have a play with chat GPT atlas. It's amazing. It's so easy.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But they've rumbled them. Because if you use the free version of Chat GPT, it doesn't let you do many queries. I mean, I spent $20 a month. It's well worth it. I spent 80. 80 quid a month on Claude.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: Because it's worth it as a business.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: But as a punter, are you going to spend 20 quid on using a search engine every month?
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: The answer to that is probably yes, eventually. Eventually, when they approve it. But it's going to be a little bit way down the line.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: But when the shopping comes, that's going to be a game changer.
- Them: Y. Eah, absolutely. But, yeah.
- Me: I think we're ready for it.
- Them: I mean, like, treated my door, you know, it feels like the last 12 months I've just been, like, banging away, just not getting. And, you know, well, we're getting loads of stuff done, but it does, you know, because the seals haven't been going up and stuff. It's just feels like we're mining. You know, when it's like. It's just not Gran. We're just, you know, chipping away. So I. I am just hopeful that, you know, we will be seeing things.
- Me: You don't need. Gareth, I would say to you, as trailblazing with your products as you are with technology,
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: That's why I can't wait for. I can't believe how excited I got about the fact you were going to do a chili plant.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah.
- Me: It's some new search terms to go out. A new avenue. We're rinsing these keywords at the moment. There's only so many that apply.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: I've switched on AI Max on those search campaigns, which will expand it out a little bit more.
- Them: Y. Eah.
- Me: But there's only so many you can do.
- Them: Yeah.
- Me: We need to be one step ahead of the competition. Really?
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like I said, I honestly think that, you know, if anytime that we speak in the future, that if it's. If it's.
- Me: I'm not allowed to say that to you. I'm not allowed to say. You need to get some old products on the website.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah. But, like, I. I think, you know, we're. We. We are going to be in a really strong place, you know, and I think these trademarked ranges that are going to be launching over the next six months. Those, you know, I. I want those to be really high end, you know, like price really high and really good quality accessories that, you know. You know, beautiful quality accessories that go out with the trees and plants so that, you know, like you can imagine seeing it in horrors or something like that, you know, when everyone's queuing. Up for it, you know, and have it and, you know, it being an older woman's magazines. And so that, that's really what I'm going to be aiming at. And I might even be that, you know, some of the oak tree gift and things like that that we, we don't, we just. Literally don't even have them anymore, but they're as part of a much more design layered sort of gifting experience for customers. So. But it's. It's tricky because it's like, literally right. You know, if we go really off the wall with it, will people get it or not? And can it be marketed through conventional channels in the same way that these current things can. But I think if we're going to do it, we'll be able to do it and, and collaboration with AI because it helps us to just crack on in the enormous rate to actually, you know, instead of having these writers block moments, it literally just zaps the. The wall so that there's no block. There anymore, you know, so. Yeah.
- Me: Cool.
- Them: Yeah, it's good, right? So. Okay. So. Well, you. You'll get the transcript.
- Me: I can't be up, mate.
- Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You keep your own there. Okay, mine.
- Me: You're going to be. The summary is a brilliant. You could talk for like, 10 hours and it'll come back with about 10 lines or something, you know. That was absolutely right on the money. It's just what you need, isn't it? It really is.
- Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, as. As indeed. So, yeah. And I think anytime that if. Anytime we need to catch up, if we just do it like this so that we've got the transcript otherwise, honestly, in one ear. Cool. Right. So I'll be in contact with you by. At the very latest, Thursday afternoon, because I'm off tomorrow and Wednesday with the kids, and then Thursday and Friday, so. But I. Yeah, I think I'll. I'll. I'll meet. I might even be today. You know how long it takes just. Run the necessary, the brand voice. So I think. Yeah, but. Cool, right? Well, thanks very much for your time, Peter. I'll speak to you soon.
- Me: All right. Ok? No. Problem. Cheers, guy.

Them: Good morning, Peter. How are you?
Me: Hello. Did you go too soon, then?
Them: Yeah. I will say it's a manic Monday here, so.
Me: Same as every Monday, I suppose.
Them: Yeah. How was your weekend?
Me: It was good. Yeah, it was good. We had a proper Sunday yesterday, which we've not had for a while. We're empty nesters.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So we don't often have a proper Sunday. So we drove up to Stainth.
Them: North yorkshire.
Me: Yes, it is. Yeah. Name? Alan. I know the area quite well because I used to help out do with DAV and they used to do all the trips around there.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Me: So my wife wanted to go to Stain, to Stainford Force, to go and watch the salmon jumping up the river because we didn't see any. We stood there for ages and got freezing cold.
Them: Brian. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: But took the dog. We lost the other dog not so long ago.
Them: All right. I'm sorry to hear about that.
Me: So we take it. Thank you. We take him out with us now. To places. But he's 14. He can't walk very far. So we went there. He was quite happy. Then went to little cafe on the way into Malham that he used to do with dav. Overlooks the valley. Absolutely beautiful. He came in, he's happy as Larry. He was getting biscuits and bits of ham from the butcher and all sorts. My wife spent about 50 quid because of that. So he did his job well. And then we went to Malam Tarn, which is. I've seen the kids walk around there so many times, I've never done it myself. And he walked four miles.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: It's fabulous. Then we came back and had roast beef. Roast beef dinner, and sat and watched the Grand Prix. It was fantastic.
Them: Y. Ep. Yeah, lovely.
Me: Proper relaxing day. And you proper tired from it as well? Just from the fresh air. Enjoyed it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. That's good. You feel like you're living, you're alive when you. You know, when you're.
Me: Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. Definitely. I'm a pain in the ass because I just need to be outside. But I'm not working. I go for a walk every morning now every single morning I go for 2 1/2 mile walk down the road.
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Because I told you up. So I do know. You do?
Me: I'll be doing it for nine months. Something like that.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, it's. It's good. You know what's nice about it? It's just seeing all the little subtle changes with the seasons, just as you know. You know, if you walked. Yeah. I mean, like, just. Yeah, just warring every. It's. There's just something really nice about it, you know, and it'd be good if you were walking to work, but instead of walking for the sake of walking, you know?
Me: Well, yeah. But that kind of adds to it as well. I listen to a podcast as I'm walking around.
Them: Oh, you're right. Yeah.
Me: On a variant. It might be on health, it might be on money, it might be on work and just Indigo. I'm aware of what's going on around me. I wouldn't do it if I was going. If it was hiking or something like, I definitely wouldn't wear headphones, but it's. Spot on when you do the same route every day.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: But, yeah, Buzzy, I do a little bit of yoga before I set off as well.
Them: Yes.
Me: It's a nice way to start the day. And you're on it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You're on it. Ready to roll. So I am ready to roll.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I. I didn't have my walk today, so I'm sort of like. I think that's. That's the problem when the kids are off. I. I started really early this morning and then. But I tend to find if I start really early, I don't do me walk. If I do me walk. And then, you know, it's in that space, you know?
Me: Peter. Habit, isn't it? It's that habit. I'm like an automaton in the morning as soon as my feet touch the floor.
Them: But. Yeah.
Me: I have a pee. I do my yoga, and I do it in a bedroom. It's like 10, 15 minutes yoga. Same exercises all the time. And then I come downstairs and go up for a walk. And it's a flow, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: If you interrupt that, you buggered.
Them: Yeah. Exactly. So right. So right. Well, I've got a good bit to get through, but basically you say where I'm at. I'll just explain. So basically, Calaber, I'm hoping that by the end of quarter one next year that we're going to be in a position where we will be looking at. Hopefully we will have taken another brand on. Now, if we are going to be doing that.
Me: Okay?
Them: We need to really upgrade them with regard to how we're operating really at the minute. Because essentially, even though everything is being done through collabor, we are still sort of thinking, my door heads on and low from speaking to you. It's exactly the same, you know, because you're just. You just see. Me as treated. Well, I am the treat of my door man. But essentially all of. All of the meaningful work is actually being done through collabor. And it's been done in a way, I suppose, that systemizes and procedures as much as possible as it would do in any agency, just really so that. So that there's if there's any repetitive tasks that they're done in the way so that it doesn't take, you know, any time at all to do it again, then the next time. So, Sensei, that's what I'm doing, so I'm doing this. With SEO, I'm doing it with merchandising. All different. Everything that it takes to run away with a website, essentially, I'm sort of putting it all together and then just like saying, right, is the way that we're working at the minute going to work easily? You know, if we take another brand? Or essentially, that's a question that I'm asking for everything how we're doing business everywhere now. A lot of our operations is now managed by a system that we've got called Collaborate Connect, which has been a year old next month, so it's nearly 12 months old. And it is literally bees knees for everything that operations. And a lot of that has been me, MD and my brain into the system. So that instead of me having to be Yoda for the freedom idea operations, that the system can be it and, you know, and then I can focus on really, you know, lock myself away for a month and coming up with ideas and then coming out to everybody. You know what? And that's really where I might be itself, and that's essentially where I'm at, you know, with that. What I did there a couple of weeks ago was really just empty my head and chat gbt, you know, about, like, look, you know, we need to do. And we're just focusing on the paperclick, saying we need to get better, you know, this. I need to know what's going on at the minute. I don't know what's going on, and obviously it just spat out. Doubly. I'll just send it over to you and hopefully you'll just reply back and I'll just put it all back in again and then it's a starting point. But when I had a read over all of that as well, I just thought, actually, I don't understand it. And if I'm being the brand, if me or somebody else on my team has been the brown liaison between you and who the brand is, I'm just like, well, actually, we need to understand what it is on a very top level way. We need to have clear reporting, but then also just have a couple of sentences about. Right. Yeah. The main things that were tweaked over the past four weeks were this, this, and this. And then I think we definitely need a sort of big matt if there's a big push on the actual product through Merchant Center, Google Merchant Center. We need to really just be keeping tabs on which ones are performing, which ones aren't actually in that. And obviously we've both got eyes on that. But I think we need to be looking at the CM table and then the cm. What's the word I'm after? Analysis is happening in that table each month, so that it's almost like football scores. Premier Division, first Division, second Division, third Division. And I know you're sort of set up like that, but I think what we need to just is that's going to be mega useful to communicate back to anybody else and that's. The type of thing that I think we need to be looking at. I think with the reporting that you've updated the email report, and I think that's fairly decent, and I think I've emailed back already about this, but I think really it's just about these other ets and Bobs, so. Did you see the agenda that's on the. Touch? No. Right. Just bear a second. I'll just share this. No. So. Yeah, I'll just. Can you see that? Ok.
Me: Yep.
Them: Yeah. Sorry. All right, so basically, just thinking general overview, performance and important framework again. I've used chat GPT to help just strengthen this, you know, to put this out. But I think, you know, between us, we could probably just rattle through. But the main reason for me doing this because I will end up just talking a lot. Of you know a lot.
Me: Can I tell you where I'm up to?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because at the end of the day, we're totally aligned. We're in a position here where we have this wonderful tool in front of us that lets us analyze what we've got.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Reports on it. And helps us make decisions going forward on in this case, on ppc. I'm currently. Could you just excuse me one second?
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: Sorry, mate. That was a collection. I needed to grab that.
Them: All right.
Me: Yeah. So I'm in a position at the moment where I'm creating what's called the Self Improving Agency.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it's gone. Out of breath now run upstairs. Is that what this morning's actually knocking me out? So the Self Improving Agency is where? Obviously, I've got a number of different clients.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And I create projects for each one of those clients, which. It's funny with using chat GPT. You can't do it in chat GPT, but you can. I use Claude a lot. Because I can plumb straight into Google Ads, Analytics, Shopify, I can look at all, pull all that data from it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: So the self improving agency is about exactly what you just said is doing the brain dump. Of that particular client for me. You know, things like this. What's the strategy? Well, it's fairly similar to everywhere else, but you're using profit metrics, and I don't use profit metrics in any other client. But also doing things like, I should have told you. I'm actually recording this now, as you probably are. Just doing a summary of the call afterwards, and then I upload that into the project as well.
Them: Yeah.
Me: As one big document and just append it all on. I'm doing things like for any changes I make on your account now, they all go into a spreadsheet. So when I'm doing the analysis at the end of the month,
Them: Yeah.
Me: It pulls that data in. So go and analyze it. But bear this in mind that this is what happened during the month.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Things are moving so quickly, aren't they? I've got something that actually looks at your products every day and if there's a change, it notes that there's been a change to the product. The price might have changed, the title might change, the status quo change.
Them: Yeah.
Me: How did that impact it? So it's going to look at all those things. So there's a lot more detail coming in. And it's like with you, it's evolving.
Them: Yeah.
Me: We're not going to get all this stuff all at the same time.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: But it is gradually evolving so I can get more and more detail. But I think the trick for both of us is to surface the outliers more than anything else.
Them: Absolutely.
Me: Because we get.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Because on our side. That we've been doing. Say, for example, you know, like on the website. I don't know if you've been on here, but really.
Me: Nice. Now.
Them: Yeah, but your story page is really. You know, focusing. It's me and my granddad, you know, that's when I was a little boy, you know, so really, it's. It's literally telling the proper story about the business. You know, we've got the actual brand nigh. You know, it does have its own voice, which, you know. Prior to that. Sometimes it was my version of its voice, sometimes it was, you know, or whoever the member of staff was. But now, you know, it's written in a way that is just completely, just spot on, you know, and.
Me: That's why I use this as a basis for the ads. So when you say to me.
Them: Yeah.
Me: About the ad text and everything. I do that anyway. I look at the website and look at the terminology, tone of voice and so on. But also adding what I add to that is my own data. About the best way to write an ad. And I started when I'm writing that, I started with 50 headlines, and I go through and select the ones that I actually want. But I've set the criteria to create those headlines. As we're saying the other day, I've done all that.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I've created that database, if you like, of and it's a constantly evolving one as well. But it's going to look at the website and create ad text and it makes sure it doesn't grate. When you go between the two of them, you click on the app, it looks the same.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, but I think what the issue is that we have been updating some pages and some products on the website and then just not updating others. So they're definitely will be.
Me: Yeah, but it's not granular. Seriously, it's not that granular. Because you look at something. Well, that's not the tone of voice of the website. Yeah, but it may be taken consideration a marketing terminology or call to action. You might won't be as pushy on the website as you would be in an ad. Because I want someone to click on it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Me: So it has to take all that into consideration. Otherwise, they're all not the same.
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, I haven't had a chance to go through the ad text yet because last two weeks of just the wez by and it has been pretty. Bloody hell. What's happening? But we are on top of when this is about same year for us to do this sort of work as well. A hobby that we're doing tonight anyway. But what I'm going to do is run through or brand Voice AI through that spreadsheet and see what it says and then sort of look before and after and see what actually looks like.
Me: Do you have a text file with your brand voice in it?
Them: Yeah. But it's like. A lot of pages or something, or 100.
Me: Took it over. I'll plug it into Claude.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I can use that, because this is exactly it. Is it specific, then, to you? I can plug that into Claude. And it'll always use that when it's doing any sort of correspondence with you or is doing any sort of analysis. We'll bear that in mind.
Them: Well, I just need to work out how we're going to, because I'm going to be getting a Claude myself as well. But what I don't want to be doing because the minute I'm the only one that can access that document, so I'm literally guarding it. But what I'm doing is sharing the GPT that the documents are part of. But then it may be that we don't use chat gbt, that we use Claude going forward or something like that.
Me: The general advice is to just head to your bets at the moment.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yeah. Don't necessarily put all your money on one horse. Claude's better for me because it uses this MCP I can look at. I can plumb straight into Google Ads. And I like the project part of it. But like with that document, if you share it with me, I don't need the whole document. Just share it, man. I'll just plummet into that project.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: And then it will carry on using. That'll be fantastic, though, if you could do that. Really good.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. Well, that. Well, that's the. But the issue is that there's version of it. So, like, in the last six months, there's been three or four versions.
Me: But if you look at that document, it will always, as we say, if you share it, if you update it, it'll always take into consideration the latest iteration version.
Them: I'm still not even sharing properly via drive. Or do you find that's useful? You know, yeah.
Me: Definitely. The only thing that it's not very good at is pulling G sheets in it. Can't really do G sheets yet. And to get Google Ads analytics, I could do with some more access to Shopify. To do some more analysis on it. And if you're okay with that, because what it does is it connects. But I need access at your end. I need you to give me permission to particularly bit. I don't know which bit it is, but then I can look at the overall picture. And see how Google Ads fits into it. So if I do that, what it's going to do is I'm going to go into Shopify and I'll just request access. It'll come through to you, then you can look at it and see whether you want to share that or not.
Them: Yeah, well, I think. What. Really, we're. We're what? My. What were my heads at is that I. I'm trying to build up. Like sort of data hubs that collaborate, manages, you know, the way you want to manage, you know, ourselves rather than, you know, having other, you know, third party such as yourselves. Like, you know.
Me: I've never understood this, Gareth.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yeah, but you've asked me to do analysis on this, and the analysis is Google Ads, analytics and Shopify.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: I can't even see your audio details. It'd be nice on one day. I do it with other clients. I go and look at an audience. I wonder what they've ordered. Oh, right. That seems to be working. So it's like a real time. Literally just pulling raw data from it.
Them: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, like, we. We can. We can have a look at that. But what. What? I.
Me: But you're not going to do it.
Them: 'm. Well, I mean, I. I don't have an appetite to do it, I think. Really. What?
Me: From my perspective, it's like you don't trust me.
Them: No, no.
Me: We're doing this for 10 years. I need to analyze your data, and you're not giving the data to analyze it.
Them: But. But anytime you've asked me to share stuff, I have shared it.
Me: No. You don't share stuff in shopify with me. Analytics in there, but I don't have stuff like products. I'm going to look at what collection.
Them: Just. Just. It's my turn for the door now. Hello. Thank. You very much. So. No, the. I mean, like, really what. What I. But where I'm at and like, you know, it's the same with other apps and things, you know, that. That we. That we work with. It's that important that we. We're. We're literally just, you know, in control, I think, of. Of the data.
Me: Well, you are. It's just Shopify Data. You shared it with me, and if you don't want to carry on sharing it with you to get rid of it, that's it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. But they. Yeah, so. But I mean, like, really, what. What we're trying to do here is trying to.
Me: On your Shopify data, it said you're selling 100 of these every single day. And on Google Ads, I'm only selling one. I wouldn't know that. Extreme case if you're most profitable product or the one you sell the most of. I'm not doing a Google Ad for it because in years gone by I didn't do particularly well and it's just dropped into a bucket somewhere. Why would I not want to revitalize that?
Them: What? You wouldn't not want to do that, But I think really.
Me: I wouldn't know to do it.
Them: Well, anyway, I think that this is a separate thing, and what I need to know.
Me: Gareth. I really don't.
Them: Well.
Me: It's your daytime.
Them: Right, so what. What I need to know is what you need, and then I can look at it, you know, so.
Me: I need to get into Shopify to look at the data. That's it. It does it through the mcp.
Them: Right. Well, I. Well, if. If you just let me know what. What things that you need.
Me: I'll send. What I'll do is I'll go into shopify. And request access, and it'll go through to the admin and it will tell you what it needs to share.
Them: To. As far as I'm aware, your setup is. A PPC consultant at the minute, which we that's literally has got. So. Yeah, so, I mean, it's. It's set up so that you can see a number of the apps and. And whatever that you've requested previously. But then if. If there's any individual things, I can just change the rule. Because the. I think the Shopify rules were introduced there earlier this year or last year or something.
Me: Yes, they were.
Them: Yeah. And that. So basically that that's, you know, you're the only person that set up under the pay per click consultant role. So you know that that can.
Me: What was the name of the. Is it true? To my door. Too, is it? I can't remember the name of the Shopify store.
Them: Two may endure.
Me: And it's a number two.
Them: Yeah.
Me: There we go.
Them: But. But I mean, really, where. Where we're going with collaborators, you know, instead of us being like, you know, like a traditional. You know, it's not a traditional agency at all. You know, everything that we're doing is about. Testims and processes and, and repeating and making sure that we're getting really good. Performance, essentially. So. And what. What we're doing at the Bennett with our system is essentially, it's like a PNL. It's bringing the PNL into. Into eCommerce. So, but all it's doing at the minute is focusing on the cost of goods. Of products. It's not. It's not looking at how much money has been spent for the marketing of that seal. So that is the next thing that we will be looking at.
Me: That's exactly what property batterys does, then.
Them: Yeah, so. But we, you know, but we want the boot. Bringing that in house or full system is unifying and, you know, whether it's like a pay per consultant such as yourself or whether it's. Our accountant or a bookkeeper or, like a VC or whatever. You know, if anyone's looking at this one system, they'll look at the part of it that means something to them. That actually helps them to, you know, to make decisions and to communicate in a way that literally, you know, each of these different people are very different from different backgrounds, different industries. And, you know, they would say, well, you need to do this. You know, in order to improve. But whatever that conversation is will be meaningful to the brand owner. And that is what's going to unlock the doors, because it'll happen quite quickly. But that's what I'm building up towards. So that's the reason why, you know, I. I'm not Keenan. You know, just sharing, you know, access to LLM, access to Shopify. Because we've, we've worked on getting the. The or sort of a fine theme, you know, so that we can access it via LLMs, and we. We can't. Nobody else can at the minute. But what. What we want?
Me: We like you saying you can't look at Google Ads data.
Them: Yeah, but what.
Me: Still your dating. You can't bring it in house either.
Them: Yeah, but we're. We're sure. I mean, like, just get, get. You know, all this is like bang up today, it really at the minute. But just leave it west me because, you know, things will be, you know, improving, you know, as we're sort of going on here.
Me: Your account will suffer slightly because of that. They don't have access to it.
Them: But. Yeah. Well.
Me: Everyone else's shopify like that. Just been full data the way I want to. How is Google Ads performing against the main account?
Them: If you. You let me know what you want, just. And then we can. We can look at it, you know, so.
Me: Clicked on it and it just sent you an email, and I don't think there's anything in it. It's not specifying specifically what it actually needs.
Them: Right? Yeah.
Me: What I'll do is. It's called go marble ads grader. Is the name of the thing. Go, Mark. Let me just. It's a plugin. This has evolved. It doesn't do upgrading anymore, but they've obviously used the same plugin to do this access.
Them: Yeah. So? Well, I mean, like. Just let. Let. Let me know what, you know, what it is that. That you want, and we can. We can look at.
Me: He's installed that plugin.
Them: Yeah.
Me: If you look in the Shopify plugin store, it'll probably have that knocking around in there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: No, I love this. I love the idea of sharing the information via these individual files.
Them: Okay?
Me: Where as you say, I'm trying to brain dump as well with my business.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because it is just me.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I actually see in the future, there's going to be value in this kind of information.
Them: Yeah. Of course, yeah.
Me: For you. That's about your business. I've watched a number of videos about it where people do a profile and they do the individual departments. HR does this. Accounts, does this. Marketing does this, and it explains the way in which things are done.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And there's no ambiguity at all about things because it's there in black and white. Every time you run a chat, in chat, GPT or Claude, it'll go and look at that and go, right, what are you talking about this now? Like that one over there.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And the whole thing with, like, with Google Ads. How do I do a brain dump of what I know? Because it changes all the time. Well, I find a way to do that.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: I've broken down certain things that I do, like creating asset groups and Google Ads, text where I want things in a particular way. I want 50 headlines, 50 description lines, and I want to be able to select the ones that I want, but based upon a criteria right at the very beginning. So then there's five different styles of headlines. It might be quirky, it might be cool to actually might be technical. Whatever it might be creates tiny of each of those. So I'm with you, mate, yeah.
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: Absolutely.
Them: Yeah. So. Well, you know, I think, you know, we're. We're doing loads of work at the minute, but we've. We've sort of went back to really like to crunch what, you know, who, who treated my daughter is what it's all about. You know what?
Me: You put in there. You've probably forgotten more than you actually put in the document.
Them: Yeah.
Me: There's so much to go through, isn't there?
Them: There's a. There's a massive amount, but, you know, it's almost like it's a, you know, as. The equivalent of a land rush that we've got here at the minute, you know, and, like, it's, you know, effectively what. What you and I are both doing is that, you know, we're. We're getting our stick, you know, and. And you're going, right, Peter. That's me and Peter. And. And it's just like, right?
Me: Yes.
Them: All this stuff that I know and the way that I'm doing it, I'm just literally laying on the foundations of that gan based on what I already know. And then once you've. Once you've built this, like, palatial mansion, that's when you want to bring.
Me: Or a behemoth. One or the other.
Them: Well, let's. Hopefully it's the manicured gardens and everything, you know, and then you're inviting then more clients to come in. And, you know, with every, with all these extra clamps that are coming in, they're getting a really good service, and it's not giving you any. It's. Not giving you a headache or any extra time. You know, basically, that's what I want to do to. To an extent. But with me, it is more on, like, right? It's been an absolute nightmare on my own business for the last 22 years. And all of the technical things that it is that has held me back, I am now, you know, kidding. The sweet shop. I can be like, right? I can. I can do this. I could actually do this now. And, you know, so we're. You know, the operations and the PNL are actually very close to just being like, running, like, really beautifully. But then the next thing is that we need to then pull on, you know, the, so marketing costs and attribution are next, you know, and what, what I want to be, be doing is to build this. System. And that system is going to be my pension, essentially. You know, that's my exit because I think trading my door can just, you know, if I lay out it, Oprah, just upright from now to kingdom come, and it would probably not make me rich, but I would pay the bills, you know, but really, I want to be able to exit. You know?
Me: Isn't it funny? You'll be selling that chat GPT file as part of the exit. That's the real value, isn't it? People don't reinvent the wheel.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I've got a guy just onboarding now. He's at ecommerce business, and it's just like he's never done ecommerce before.
Them: Yeah.
Me: He should buy from China till he's blue in the face and beautifully do it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: But as far as ecommerce is concerned,
Them: Yeah.
Me: Really don't know.
Them: Yeah.
Me: If you could actually do that and getting people used to using Chat GPT in the same way as they do Google.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Go and ask it. I was down in the kitchen before with chat GPT on voice mode, just asking it questions about stuff.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Absolutely amazing.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, right? So we'll. Let's just have a look at this. There. I'm just gonna share this. Are you looking at the. Can you see? The meeting notes.
Me: There we go.
Them: Are. Right, so. Right? I mean, look. I think, really it's just sort of knowing what. The sort of funnels are really in the business. So that I can then just because, see, like with Ryan. So Ryan, who's working with me, he's like a graduate. He's had a good, really good grinding in operations, you know, customer service first in the business, and then he's quite good with spreadsheets and he's a clever lad. So, literally, you know, I'm able to, like, say, let go and find out about this and you'll just be able. To do it and AI in a way that's helping them so you can get loads more done. But when it comes to actually me explaining how the treaty might work, how it works, you know, I was able to sort of say, right. We've got Channable on there and we've got Profit metrics. And then you've got Product Hero, but we don't exactly know how that's working. But then. And then we're focusing very much on pmax, but then there hasn't. P.mx and Chopin. But that was as much as I could sort of say. And then it sort of made me realize, well, actually, you know, we've been doing a lot of this work on the brand, but then we haven't been. You and I haven't been having any communication back and forth about the. Brand. We've sort of been doing that independently from you. And then obviously you're using our website to get the information, but then we haven't really had that, you know, information about this is what we're up to, you know. You know, on that and sort of almost like sort of saying we'll. Have a date where we'll catch up and we'll show you what we've done and we'll give you the information whatever way we're going to give it. So I think that sort of underlines that there's been a two way thing there just about. What's new on both sides that perhaps, you know, we could have been a bit better at, and I think we definitely can be better at going forward. And sure. And, you know, and it might be that as well as you sending us a monthly summary. We send you a monthly summary, and then if there's things on that, you're like, well, actually, guys, you know, what, what about this? Because then that way you can use that monthly summary to feed into your systems, you know. And if anything pops out the other side, you were like, actually, yeah, you know, that. That sounds great. You know, and I could. I could really use that.
Me: It would have been good to know the website have been changed.
Them: Yeah. I mean, it's.
Me: I did a big change, and it coincided exactly with the website. And it absolutely tanked.
Them: Right? Right.
Me: Because I'd split out the pmax campaign at the time because I noticed the conversion rates are down quite dramatically over the last seven days.
Them: Yeah.
Me: The same time as me doing that. We didn't stand a hope in hell.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Doing? Working, so I've reverted it.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: Website settled down a little bit.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, like, we're. We. We have been seeing that the conversion rate on the site had really improved last week compared to what it was. But then at the weekend there. Well, it's certainly on Sunday, it was awful. Yesterday. You know, I think we had four orders all. All day or something. But prior, you know, Saturday was great. Previous, you know, last week.
Me: Just before I came out, I was looking at analytics. And it says conversions are dropped by 32% and conversion rates gone from 3.95 to 2.43 compared with the previous week. I reverted what I'd done at the end of last week. As I can see, it wasn't heading the right sort of direction.
Them: Right, okay.
Me: It might be case settling from a personal view. The big images on the home page do nothing for me.
Them: Yeah. No. Well, yeah. I mean, the omp is going to be updated.
Me: Yeah. I look at product pages. Seriously, I love them. Absolutely love them.
Them: Most of the work's been put into product and collection and cart. And homepage, we've kept it the same, but then we're going to be removing some blocks and replace them and new ones, you know, so. Great. Okay, so.
Me: Cool.
Them: Yeah, Brandon, Copy. So I'm going to be reviewing that. What I'm going to do is run. Run that through our brand voice and see what it suggests, or if it's suggest anything.
Me: I'll say again, if you can provide your brand voice.
Them: Yeah.
Me: What you don't put into that is my skill. It's my sphere of knowledge, my specialism. The best thing you can do as far as that's concerned is to share the document. Just to say, this is our Brown voice and I'll consideration.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Me: I'm just trying to save you some time because.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, no, and I get. I get it. I think I just need to frame it in May I. What way I'm going to be using this document? Because at the minute, it sort of like, it's. It's like the crown jewels. It's like literally this is everything, you know about. But it is just, you know, it's like a story. You know, how it's done. But anyway, but I. There. There is other things that I will be able to. I. I'll come back to you because I need to get my docs in a row a bit more for this, you know, so.
Me: Ok? I'm the same, to be honest. It's an evolving landscape at the moment.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: That's the thing. Whilst we have it in our was, I was a bit off post fall the other morning, just going through this kind of stuff and it does piggle your head because you go, this is so powerful.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But you could go like that, and there are loads of different directions, but it's just collecting your thoughts first.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah, exactly.
Me: Can't. Do, and then it's going to apply to the business.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's all about structure, really, you know, because, you know, a few. If you can have an idea about the structure, you know, and, and it is at four in the morning that is waking up really early on this, on the Saturday, you've got stuff in your head and I think, right. That's really. Good, actually. I need to just get that down and share it, you know, And. And it's those moments where you get the. The. The car, the brilliance, that you can then build structure around that, and all of a sudden you've got something like, see, that's got real value.
Me: I've got a really good tool for you. I don't know. I mentioned this last time to you. Think of Whisper Flow.
Them: Whisper flow. No.
Me: Wispr. Flow, flow.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I don't type very much now. I just talk.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it's not just a voice to text. It's an AI voice to text. So, literally, on my Mac keyboard here, I just hold down the function key and talk, and no matter what text box you're in, do it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Obviously, the spelling, grammar and all the rest of it will be correct. You can go into command mode and say, can you make that a bit clearer? And it will change that text no matter where you are.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because all these things have a microphone input.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But this is a uniform one, right across everything. So, like, when you're doing about the business kind of thing, you can just ramble on with it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: And then you go back to your afterwards. Can you just make that less gibberish?
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: Make it a bit more structured. I mean, it doesn't matter if a chat GPT any.
Them: Y. Eah, yeah.
Me: I've got my microphone here all the time.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And just to try and make it as clear as possible when I'm talking.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I don't know. It does. Ulster or not, though.
Them: Well, I won't be using it, then.
Me: But seriously, it's like 135 words per minute I can do on that.
Them: Yeah, we say I'm. I'm much better. Than when I'm not talking. Actually, I'm better.
Me: I. Used to think, though. Yeah, I used to think that. And I've changed dramatically now.
Them: Like. Yeah, maybe if, you know, forgetting to the way something. Mate, mate. But it's the wolf. I'm very woefully when I'm speaking, but when I'm thinking, I'm not like that at all. So it's really frustrating for me when I talk, you know, because. Brand. I'll have look over that and we'll see what a bit what we want to do. You know, west there. With about sharing the brand voice with you and what we're going to do that going forward. So.
Me: As I say, that's the way you could help me the most is with.
Them: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We definitely will be able to.
Me: Okay? Even if you're broken down. Bit of it. If there's just a couple of pages with the voice and it doesn't contain all the rest of the stuff.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: Be superb.
Them: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'll be able to do that.
Me: Great.
Them: Visibility, collaboration. So. So, really, I think. You know, as I mentioned before, it's about. I think if we're. If we can. Because ideally, what. What we both need to do is automate as much as possible so that then anytime that we do need to talk is really on bang on the money stuff, you know, so. And I think, you know, with. Regard to that, then it's like saying, this is the model that we're working to on the account.
Me: Yeah.
Them: If there's going to be any major changes on that, that we just use the chart to sort of like say, look, we're, we're going to be, you know, we, we should have went on said we're going to be updating the website, you know, the update and the theme. We're going to be doing it here. We're going to be doing this, we're going to be doing that. And then, you know, on your side you say, right, well, I'll hold off then, you know, But I think really that two way communication is possibly going to be a good way to sort that out. Now, also in Google Chat now, there is a way. To set it up so that. Let me just say. Do we have a paper collect? Did I set up a PaperClick one?
Me: Is this thing? This is in Google Meet, is it?
Them: Google. No google chat.
Me: Okay?
Them: Which is. Yeah, we. We do, actually. So. Yeah, so let. Let me. Yeah, you see.
Me: I never look at this.
Them: Because at the minutes, and we're set up in this space and we're hardly using it at all, whereas the other spaces that we've got, we're just using it all the time. Now, the benefit, one of the benefits of this. Is that we can go into space settings here. And you can look at apps and integrations and you can, you can actually have this plugged into your webhook. So if we are chatting regular, more regular, this webhook can be plugged into one of your systems so that it absolutely knows what we're talking about all the time.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Now.
Me: The first thing is to actually use it, though. I say I don't use Google Chat for anyone at all.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So I've got to get it. So I've got that open all the time on my desktop.
Them: But you see, you see, link in. If you're in your Gmail, all you have to do is show your.
Me: I don't use Gmail. I'm on a Mac, so I use another thing so I can pull in loads of different email addresses. On it.
Them: See the. The other. Well, if you prefer to message on phone, then you can do it very. The app, the Gmail app on your phone will have the chat is just a bit in the middle of it as well, like WhatsApp. But then you can. Yeah, you can do all sorts of stuff with it and you know any. Shared documents. You just go into shared. And anytime in the past that we shared stuff, you just find them like this. And, you know, it just makes things so much easier. If there's a task, you just, like, say, right? I'll put a task on there for Gareth, you know, because I need them to do that for me, and basically that goes under my task list, and I'll make sure I get it done, you know?
Me: I wonder if I can get it to email me when the chat comes in.
Them: Yeah, it does. It will do you. That automatically does it. We'll do it in the middle of the night. It'll say, here's what you've missed.
Me: Okay?
Them: Yeah. And they've improved at massively, you know, over the last 12 months as well. You know, it's been really good.
Me: Well, I say I tend to use WhatsApp and Teams for everybody else, but it sounds strange. I'll have to find a way to integrate that into what I'm using at the moment.
Them: Yeah. I mean, like, I'm. I'm sure. I'm sure it's possible, you know, but if you just look at, you know, Google chats, spaces, that's what you want to be looking for. And the Grayson of Google chat spaces into, you know, but you can. I think you can. Yeah. You use web hooks to plug it into something that you're already using, that a lot of money just pop in there.
Me: Yeah. Okay? All right.
Them: Yeah, so. Yeah, but I think, you know, this is very well set up to integrate other things, so I think that'll be useful, you know, for. For you. Now, one of the things that I'm worried about is that there could. Be. I've. I've got it in my head that, you know, with, with some of the performance stuff with the Albert pay per click this year. That. It just. It doesn't seem like normal compared to what. What has happened before. And I am worried that.
Me: This really hasn't been a normal year.
Them: Yeah, but I, I, I'm sort of worried that there's either competitors or that their potency could be affiliates who are going mine or back and bidding on stuff with, with or knowing.
Me: You have competitors. Anyway, in every space that I'm working at the moment, the competition has gone up.
Them: Yeah.
Me: And that could be Temu, it could be Amazon, whoever. It has gone up. And that's because one of the things with that is the advent of PMAX campaigns and the fact that Google are pushing them.
Them: Yeah.
Me: As being an easy way to get onto Google Ads. And you can tell that because you look at impression shares are harder to get and if we do get them, then the CPCs have gone up. That is absolutely right across the board that every cpcs have gone up this year.
Them: Yeah.
Me: More than any other year, and that's for everybody.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: I don't know whether they're trying to increase the stock price or I think it is just more people are in the space now. And because you've got things like. So you got things like AI Max on search campaigns, which is expanding it out into all these areas, like aio. On Google because you've got that. Because there is that expansion, you're starting to overlap with other people as well. More and more. You don't think you're in your space. Just do normal birthday gifting.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Because just try every now and again. Always keep that a go. See whether that works or not.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So that is absolutely a theme.
Them: Yeah.
Me: For pretty much all my Google Ads accounts this year just to put pressure on average CPC.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, like, I think. Yeah, those are the main things, really. You know, I think so. You know, we're not. We are actually more aligned, I think, than we thought, I think, you know.
Me: Definitely. We're both struggling with it in our own way, aren't we?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Promised. We're struggling in the fact of this is a whole new thing to learn, really, isn't it?
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Right. We'll nail it. But we want 500 things all at the same time.
Them: Yeah, but I do think that we. We do have an advantage because we've got years of experience that, that we literally can. Yeah, you know, I think we can. We can literally use our experience with AI that's maybe a lot more collaborative than maybe somebody that just doesn't have the level of experience, which. You know, when it works, it's great. You know, when you're on the flow, it's brilliant. But once. Once you fall down these rabbit holes, it's like it's. Yeah, it's. It's. It's literally, it's. It's. It's. It feels nice, and you like being in there, but then you realize, well, wait a minute, I'm flipping stuck here. You know? You know, and it's like recognizing those Uturns as well, but, you know.
Me: Just you wait till you get into Claude and you start using skills on Claude. Where that's repeatable actions. So it creates a skill, like an app, almost. You just say run that skill for this run. That's. And it produces some results.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Me: It's heavy stuff, really heavy stuff.
Them: Yeah.
Me: As far as I'm concerned. I think we're missing the details on LLMs Txt. I think that's a massive opportunity missing out on. It's something that would take an hour to implement and all of a sudden you get a free tracker, free traffic. You're dictating what chat GPT is, actually, well, any LLM is saying about you.
Them: I think we have implemented one already and we are going to be doing the other one. So. So we are going to be doing both of those. Is just literally that. I think you sent that over.
Me: It's just a question. Great. 10 questions. And it goes and creates the lms txt.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Agents txt and the actual prompting has been written by an AI guy.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Is the guy whose training course is a mon at the moment he's properly switched on. So it kind of takes every if but or maybe out of it. If it's just Those, literally those 10 questions, answer them as thoroughly as you can. I can plug it in, it creates the LLMs txt and it creates the agents txt as well.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Me: Which, the way agents look at your site,
Them: Yeah.
Me: And it's amazing. The minute you don't have to wait for it to crawl the website, you load it up into the root directory. You can then go and say to chat GPT tell me all about treating my door. Bang.
Them: Yeah.
Me: It's all your stuff that appears.
Them: Right? Right.
Me: Defaulting to something else, it's actually saying the right thing.
Them: Yeah, yeah.
Me: And the other thing that's going to be really important going forward is the way Chat GPT are moving into the same space as Google. So Chat GPT the other day produced a browser called Atlas. I don't know you saw it or not. So Atlas is a Atlas. It's built on chrome. It's built on chromium. But it is. Well, yeah, you just ask it questions and it goes and finds stuff out for you because now leads into them having a route into a marketplace of paid ads.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Because they're going to do it. They have to.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I don't know how they're going to do it, but they will be doing it.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: And we just need to make sure we're ready for it.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because there will be something similar to Google shopping ads, but I don't know what it's going to be yet.
Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.
Me: But have a play with chat GPT atlas. It's amazing. It's so easy.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But they've rumbled them. Because if you use the free version of Chat GPT, it doesn't let you do many queries. I mean, I spent $20 a month. It's well worth it. I spent 80. 80 quid a month on Claude.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Because it's worth it as a business.
Them: Yeah.
Me: But as a punter, are you going to spend 20 quid on using a search engine every month?
Them: Yeah.
Me: The answer to that is probably yes, eventually. Eventually, when they approve it. But it's going to be a little bit way down the line.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: But when the shopping comes, that's going to be a game changer.
Them: Y. Eah, absolutely. But, yeah.
Me: I think we're ready for it.
Them: I mean, like, treated my door, you know, it feels like the last 12 months I've just been, like, banging away, just not getting. And, you know, well, we're getting loads of stuff done, but it does, you know, because the seals haven't been going up and stuff. It's just feels like we're mining. You know, when it's like. It's just not Gran. We're just, you know, chipping away. So I. I am just hopeful that, you know, we will be seeing things.
Me: You don't need. Gareth, I would say to you, as trailblazing with your products as you are with technology,
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: That's why I can't wait for. I can't believe how excited I got about the fact you were going to do a chili plant.
Them: Yeah. Yeah.
Me: It's some new search terms to go out. A new avenue. We're rinsing these keywords at the moment. There's only so many that apply.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I've switched on AI Max on those search campaigns, which will expand it out a little bit more.
Them: Y. Eah.
Me: But there's only so many you can do.
Them: Yeah.
Me: We need to be one step ahead of the competition. Really?
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like I said, I honestly think that, you know, if anytime that we speak in the future, that if it's. If it's.
Me: I'm not allowed to say that to you. I'm not allowed to say. You need to get some old products on the website.
Them: Yeah. Yeah. But, like, I. I think, you know, we're. We. We are going to be in a really strong place, you know, and I think these trademarked ranges that are going to be launching over the next six months. Those, you know, I. I want those to be really high end, you know, like price really high and really good quality accessories that, you know. You know, beautiful quality accessories that go out with the trees and plants so that, you know, like you can imagine seeing it in horrors or something like that, you know, when everyone's queuing. Up for it, you know, and have it and, you know, it being an older woman's magazines. And so that, that's really what I'm going to be aiming at. And I might even be that, you know, some of the oak tree gift and things like that that we, we don't, we just. Literally don't even have them anymore, but they're as part of a much more design layered sort of gifting experience for customers. So. But it's. It's tricky because it's like, literally right. You know, if we go really off the wall with it, will people get it or not? And can it be marketed through conventional channels in the same way that these current things can. But I think if we're going to do it, we'll be able to do it and, and collaboration with AI because it helps us to just crack on in the enormous rate to actually, you know, instead of having these writers block moments, it literally just zaps the. The wall so that there's no block. There anymore, you know, so. Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Them: Yeah, it's good, right? So. Okay. So. Well, you. You'll get the transcript.
Me: I can't be up, mate.
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You keep your own there. Okay, mine.
Me: You're going to be. The summary is a brilliant. You could talk for like, 10 hours and it'll come back with about 10 lines or something, you know. That was absolutely right on the money. It's just what you need, isn't it? It really is.
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, as. As indeed. So, yeah. And I think anytime that if. Anytime we need to catch up, if we just do it like this so that we've got the transcript otherwise, honestly, in one ear. Cool. Right. So I'll be in contact with you by. At the very latest, Thursday afternoon, because I'm off tomorrow and Wednesday with the kids, and then Thursday and Friday, so. But I. Yeah, I think I'll. I'll. I'll meet. I might even be today. You know how long it takes just. Run the necessary, the brand voice. So I think. Yeah, but. Cool, right? Well, thanks very much for your time, Peter. I'll speak to you soon.
Me: All right. Ok? No. Problem. Cheers, guy.
