**Subject:** Google Ads Click Spike Explained - Product Feed Issue

---

Hi [Client Name],

I've identified the cause of the click spike on October 27-28.

**What Happened:**

Your campaigns saw a 316% click increase, with one product (The Olive Tree Gift - £28.99, Product ID 01090) accounting for 1,465 clicks on October 28th alone.

**Root Cause:**

Product 01090 has been flickering in and out of your Google Merchant Center feed multiple times per day since October 25th. The product was removed and re-added 4 times on October 29th alone.

**Why This Matters:**

When a product is repeatedly removed and re-added, Google's algorithm treats it as "new inventory" each time and gives it priority in auctions. This caused the massive click surge.

**Likely Cause:**

This flickering typically indicates stock synchronization issues - the product is likely going in/out of stock rapidly in your inventory system.

**Next Steps:**

1. Check your stock levels for product 01090
2. Review your Merchant Center feed for any disapproval warnings
3. Ensure consistent stock availability for this high-performer

The product is currently active at £28.99 and clearly performs well when stable. I've now enabled enhanced tracking to catch these issues immediately going forward.

Let me know if you'd like me to investigate further.

Best regards,
Peter
