## 🎨 CREATIVE PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### **✅ What Works (Keep Using)**
1. **Brand trust signals:** "Tree2mydoor", "Since 2003", "Established"
2. **Specific products:** Olive Trees, Lemon Trees, Rose Bushes (not generic "gifts")
3. **Emotional benefits:** "Lasting memories", "Grow more meaningful", "Living tribute"
4. **Occasions:** Birthdays, Anniversaries, Memorials (not generic "any occasion")
5. **Urgency + convenience:** "Next day delivery", "Gift wrapped"
6. **Ethical angle:** "Ethical", "Sustainable" (when paired with specific products)
7. **Size/space solutions:** "Small gardens & patios", "Perfect for balconies"

### **❌ What Doesn't Work (Avoid)**
1. **Generic superlatives:** "Perfect", "Ultimate", "Fabulous" (without context)
2. **Negative framing:** "Scrap the...", "Why gift X when..."
3. **Feature dumps:** Long lists without emotional benefit
4. **Limiting language:** "Perfect for patio" (without broader appeal)
5. **Vague promises:** "Gifts that last" (too generic)
6. **Clichés:** "Gifts that grow & bloom" (overused, meaningless)

## 📞 NOTES FOR GARETH

**Why these changes:**
- Data shows 10 assets have spent £350+ with zero/minimal conversions over 6 months
- Top performers follow clear patterns: brand name + specific products + emotional benefits
- Current generic headlines ("Gifts that last") lack differentiation and trust signals

**Expected impact:**
- Immediate: Freed budget reallocates to proven winners
- Week 2-4: Improved CTR and conversion rate as better assets get more impressions
- Month 2-3: Campaign ROAS lifts 8-12% as algorithm learns which new assets work

**Low risk approach:**
- Pausing underperformers = zero downside (they're not converting anyway)
- New assets follow proven patterns from existing top performers
- Phased rollout allows monitoring and adjustment
