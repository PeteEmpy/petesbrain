**Date Range:** October 26-28, 2025
**Campaign:** T2MD | P Max | HP&P Roses 150 5/9 140 23/10
**Total Increase:** 316% (from ~226 clicks/day to 2,630 clicks/day)

---

- Paradoxically, this product was listed in the "removed products" file, but clearly remained active

## Key Findings

### 1. "Removed" Products Are Still Active

**Critical Discovery:** Many products listed as "removed on Oct 26" are actually the highest performers:
- Product 01090 (Olive Tree 2L) - **1,465 clicks Oct 28**
- Product 03539 (Dwarf Lemon) - 368 clicks Oct 27
- Product 00593 (Lemon Tree Large) - 224 clicks Oct 28
- Product 01262 (Kaffir Lime) - 99 clicks Oct 28
- Product 01090-2 (Pair of Olive Trees) - 160 clicks Oct 26

**Implication:** The "removed products" list may be:
- Inaccurate (products weren't actually removed)
- Temporary (products were removed then re-added)
- Feed lag (Google Shopping feed takes time to update)

### 2. Google Algorithm Change

**Evidence:**
- Single product (01090) received 50x increase in impressions overnight
- No corresponding campaign budget or bid changes detected
- Performance Max campaign behavior suggests algorithmic optimization shift

**Likely Scenario:** Google's Performance Max algorithm identified product 01090 as high-performing and aggressively prioritized it in the auction.

### 3. Campaign Change History

**Only one change detected Oct 25-27:**
- Oct 27, 10:48 AM: Campaign budget UPDATE on "T2MD | Shopping | Catch All 170 150 20/10 140 23/10"
- This is NOT the Performance Max campaign driving the spike
- No feed, campaign, or budget changes detected on the P Max campaign

### 4. Cost Implications

| Metric | Oct 25 | Oct 28 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Clicks | 226 | 2,630 | +1,064% |
| Cost | £114.06 | £324.20 | +184% |
| CPC | £0.50 | £0.12 | -76% |

**Analysis:**
- CPC dropped dramatically (£0.50 → £0.12)
- Total cost increased 184% but click volume increased 1,064%
- **Efficiency improved significantly** - getting more clicks for less cost per click

## Root Cause Assessment

### ❌ NOT Caused By:
- Removing 98 products (products listed as "removed" are still active and driving traffic)
- Campaign budget changes (no changes detected on P Max campaign)
- Bid adjustments (no changes in change history)
- Ad copy changes (no evidence of creative updates)

### ✅ Likely Caused By:
1. **Google Algorithm Shift** - Performance Max identified product 01090 as high-converting and massively increased impression share
2. **Feed Update/Priority Change** - Product 01090 may have received higher priority in the feed (price, stock, or position change)
3. **Competitive Auction Dynamics** - Competitors may have reduced bids, allowing Tree2mydoor to win more auctions at lower CPCs
4. **Stock/Availability Change** - Product 01090 may have come back in stock after being unavailable

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Verify Feed Status** - Check the Google Merchant Center feed to confirm:
   - Which products are actually active/removed
   - Product 01090 pricing and stock status
   - Recent feed uploads or changes

2. **Monitor Product 01090 Performance** - Track whether this spike sustains or drops off:
   - Check conversion rate for this product
   - Verify profitability at current CPC (£0.12)
   - Ensure sufficient stock to meet demand

3. **Investigate "Removed" Products** - Reconcile the "products removed" list with actual feed:
   - Identify which products were actually removed vs. stayed active
   - Determine if removals were intentional or accidental

### Strategic Considerations:

1. **Capitalize on Low CPC** - Current CPC of £0.12 is 76% lower than baseline (£0.50):
   - If conversions are profitable, consider increasing budget
   - Monitor ROAS to ensure quality of traffic

2. **Diversify Product Performance** - Relying on one product for 56% of clicks is risky:
   - Ensure adequate stock levels for product 01090
   - Identify backup products if this one drops off

3. **Understand Algorithm Behavior** - Performance Max is optimizing heavily toward one product:
   - This may indicate product 01090 has highest conversion rate
   - Or algorithm is still learning and may shift again

## Questions to Investigate

1. **Feed Data:** Was there a feed update on Oct 26-27? Check Merchant Center history
2. **Pricing:** Did product 01090 price change? (Lower price = more competitive)
3. **Stock:** Was product 01090 out of stock and came back in stock?
4. **Conversion Rate:** What is product 01090's conversion rate compared to other products?
5. **Competitor Activity:** Did competitors reduce bids or go out of stock for olive tree products?
