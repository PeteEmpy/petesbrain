# Wispr Flow Note

Rock Systems note there is a trending search categories G-sheet that's been generated on a regular basis. I think for Tree2Mydoor, could I use this? Would it be useful for analysis or creating future keyword campaigns? If we actually looked at this on a regular basis, it's already been created by scripts; it'd be a shame not to use it.
