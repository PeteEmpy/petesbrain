## 📋 Report Context & Data Notes

**Why Dec 21st is excluded:**
- Dec 21st was **yesterday** (report run on Dec 22nd)
- ProfitMetrics conversion tracking has 24-48 hour lag
- Dec 21st currently shows 1 conversion (incomplete data, not a tracking failure)
- Will populate fully by Dec 23-24th

**Why we're using YoY comparison:**
- Tree2mydoor has clear seasonal patterns (gift business with Christmas delivery cut-offs)
- Week-over-week comparisons misleading during seasonal transitions
- Year-over-year (Dec 2024 vs Dec 2025) shows true performance vs seasonal baseline

## 🎄 Seasonal Pattern Analysis

### Pre-Christmas Performance Pattern

Both years show **POAS compression** as Christmas approaches (normal seasonal behaviour):

| Period | 2024 POAS | 2025 POAS | Pattern |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Week 1 (Dec 8-14)** | 189% | 180% | Baseline |
| **Week 2 (Dec 15-20)** | 174% | 134% | Pre-Christmas peak |
| **POAS Change** | **-15pp** | **-45pp** | ⚠️ 3x worse decline |

**2024 Seasonal Pattern:**
- Dec 8-14: £2,855 spend, 189% POAS (strong baseline)
- Dec 15-20: £3,512 spend (+23%), 174% POAS (-15pp drop)
- **Pattern:** Moderate spend increase, modest POAS compression

**2025 Seasonal Pattern:**
- Dec 8-14: £2,447 spend, 180% POAS (similar baseline to 2024)
- Dec 15-20: £3,616 spend (+48%), 134% POAS (-45pp drop)
- **Pattern:** Aggressive spend increase, severe POAS compression

**Key Insight:** While POAS compression is normal pre-Christmas, this year's magnitude (45pp drop) is **3x worse** than last year's pattern (15pp drop).

## Performance Analysis

### 🔴 Primary Issue: Year-over-Year Efficiency Decline

**What Changed:**
- POAS decreased from 180% (Dec 2024) to 153% (Dec 2025) - **28-point decline**
- Profit dropped £2,226 (-19%) despite similar spend levels
- Week 2 (Dec 15-20) saw severe compression: 134% POAS vs last year's 174%

**Why It Happened:**
1. **Spend acceleration without efficiency** - Week 2 spend increased 48% but POAS dropped 45pp
2. **Margin compression** - Dec 18-19 showed unprofitable days (101%-107% POAS)
3. **Possible product mix shift** - Lower-margin products getting more traffic
4. **CPC environment changes** - Competition or Quality Score degradation

**Diagnosis:** Not purely seasonal (last year handled Christmas better). Real efficiency decline requiring investigation.

**Context from CONTEXT.md:**
- **Black Friday ROAS experiment (Nov 24):** Multiple campaigns reduced from 140-150% to 120% targets
  - Task noted "should have been reverted by Nov 25th" but unclear if this happened
  - Current low POAS may be result of experiment still running
- **Target POAS:** 160% (account-level blended target per Gareth's brief)
- **Current Performance:** 153% (7 points below target, but 28 points below last year)

---

### ⚠️ Secondary Issue: Pre-Christmas POAS Compression Magnitude

**What Changed:**
- Week 1 (Dec 8-14): 180% POAS - stable baseline
- Week 2 (Dec 15-20): 134% POAS - **45-point drop**
- Last year's drop: Only 15 points (189% → 174%)

**Why It Happened:**
- Algorithmic spend acceleration (+48% week-over-week) seeking volume before Christmas cut-off
- Quality of incremental traffic declining (diminishing returns on spend)
- Possible delivery cut-off panic causing aggressive bidding on lower-intent traffic

**Expected vs Actual:**
- **Expected:** Moderate POAS compression (15-20pp like last year)
- **Actual:** Severe compression (45pp) - 3x worse than seasonal baseline

---

### 🎯 Christmas Delivery Cut-Off Context

**Last Year's Pattern (2024):**
- Dec 20: 97% POAS (drop from 166% on Dec 18)
- Dec 21: 86% POAS - **massive drop indicating post-cut-off period**
- Pattern suggests delivery cut-off around Dec 20-21

**This Year's Implications:**
- Dec 20: 134% POAS (already compressed but not catastrophic)
- Dec 21: Incomplete data (conversion lag)
- **Likely scenario:** Dec 21 onwards will show similar post-cut-off collapse

**Strategic Note:** Current analysis covers PRE-cut-off period (Dec 8-20). Post-cut-off performance will likely drop further as last year showed.

## Campaign Breakdown (WoW Comparison for Context)

**Note:** Campaign-level analysis uses Week-over-Week (Dec 15-20 vs Dec 8-14) for operational insight, but interpret with seasonal context.

### Top Campaigns by Spend (Dec 15-20, 2025)

| Campaign | This Week | Last Week | Change | This Week POAS | Last Week POAS | POAS Change |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Shopping \| Catch All** | £1,597 | £413 | **+287%** | 134% | 201% | -67pp |
| **P Max \| HP&P** | £1,149 | £1,371 | -16% | 89% | 177% | -88pp 🔴 |
| **Search \| Trees Port** | £748 | £236 | **+217%** | 130% | 212% | -82pp |
| **Search \| Roses** | £171 | £87 | +98% | 78% | 86% | -8pp |
| **DSA** | £155 | £81 | +92% | 189% | 241% | -51pp |
| **Brand Inclusion** | £153 | £55 | **+179%** | 73% | 171% | -98pp 🔴 |

**Key Observations:**
1. **Every campaign** experienced POAS decline (consistent with account-level pattern)
2. **Shopping Catch All** exploded +287% spend (algorithmic volume seeking)
3. **P Max HP&P & Brand** showing critical POAS drops (-88pp, -98pp respectively)
4. **Spending increased** across board but efficiency collapsed

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. 🔴 P0 - Verify Black Friday Experiment Status (THIS WEEK)

**Issue:** Unclear if Nov 24th ROAS reduction experiment (140-150% → 120%) was reverted

**Context from CONTEXT.md:**
- Multiple campaigns reduced to 120% targets on Nov 24th
- Task created to "REVERT ROAS from 120% back to 140%" with note "Revert by Tuesday Nov 25"
- Current account POAS (153%) is 7 points below target but 28 points below last year
- Low ROAS targets may be allowing unprofitable spend

**Impact:** If experiment still running, accounts for systematic POAS compression across all campaigns

**Actions:**
1. Check current ROAS targets in Google Ads:
   - P Max HP&P (expected: 150%, experiment: 120%)
   - P Max Unprofitable (expected: 150%, experiment: 120%)
   - Search Roses (expected: 150%, experiment: 120%)
   - Shopping Catch All (expected: 150%, experiment: 120%)
   - Shopping Low Traffic (expected: 140%, experiment: 120%)
2. If still at 120%, revert to pre-experiment levels immediately
3. Monitor 48-hour post-reversion performance

**Timeline:** Complete by Wednesday 25th December

---

### 2. ⚠️ P1 - Investigate P Max HP&P Efficiency Collapse (NEXT WEEK)

**Issue:** Flagship Heroes & Sidekicks campaign POAS: 177% → 89% (-88pp WoW)

**Context:** This is the primary revenue driver using Product Hero categorisation

**Actions:**
1. Review Product Hero label assignments:
   - Verify Heroes still properly categorised
   - Check for Tier C products (low margin) infiltrating campaign
2. Audit asset performance (headlines, descriptions, images)
3. Check Merchant Centre feed stability (Oct 2025 Olive Tree incident precedent)
4. Review audience signals - refresh if saturated

**Timeline:** Complete by 2nd January 2026

---

### 3. ⚠️ P1 - Cap Shopping Catch All Daily Budget (THIS WEEK)

**Issue:** Spend exploded £413 → £1,597 (+287%) with POAS drop 201% → 134%

**Context:** "Catch All" campaign capturing lower-margin products with runaway spending

**Actions:**
1. Implement daily budget cap: £600-800/day maximum
2. Review product-level performance for Dec 15-20 spend spike
3. Verify Product Hero Tier C throttling rules active
4. Monitor for 7 days - pause if POAS doesn't recover above 150%

**Timeline:** Implement cap by Wednesday 25th December

---

### 4. ⚠️ P2 - Post-Christmas Strategy Review (EARLY JANUARY)

**Issue:** Christmas cut-off approaching/passed (likely Dec 20-21 based on 2024 pattern)

**Context:** Post-cut-off performance will further decline (last year dropped to 86% POAS)

**Actions:**
1. Wait for Dec 21-24 conversion data to fully populate
2. Confirm delivery cut-off date for Christmas 2025
3. Review post-cut-off performance (Dec 21-31)
4. Plan January restart strategy:
   - Optimal ROAS targets for January (lower volume, higher efficiency)
   - Budget allocation post-Christmas
   - Product mix focus (evergreen vs seasonal)

**Timeline:** Schedule for week of 6th January 2026

---

## Year-over-Year Summary

### What's Working
✅ **Similar spend efficiency** - CPA stable YoY (£13.46 vs £13.67)
✅ **Volume maintained** - Similar conversion volumes despite challenging conditions
✅ **Week 1 baseline** - Dec 8-14 POAS (180%) matched last year (189%)

### What's Not Working
🔴 **Profit generation down 19%** - £2,226 less profit than last year (same period)
🔴 **Week 2 compression** - 45pp POAS drop vs last year's 15pp (3x worse)
🔴 **Campaign-wide efficiency loss** - Every campaign showing POAS decline
🔴 **Margin erosion** - Dec 18-19 unprofitable (101%-107% POAS)

### Strategic Priority
**Primary focus:** Restore YoY efficiency parity (153% → 180% POAS target)
**Secondary focus:** Manage seasonal transitions better (45pp drops unsustainable)
**Tactical:** Verify ROAS targets, cap runaway spend, investigate P Max HP&P

## Data Notes & Methodology

**Period Selection:**
- **Primary comparison:** Dec 8-20, 2025 vs Dec 8-20, 2024 (same dates, complete data)
- **Secondary comparison:** WoW (Dec 15-20 vs Dec 8-14) for operational context
- **Excluded:** Dec 21st (yesterday - conversion lag, will populate by Dec 23-24)

**POAS Calculation:**
- Tree2mydoor uses ProfitMetrics - `conversions_value` = PROFIT (not revenue)
- POAS = (Profit / Spend) × 100
- Target: 160% account-level blended

**Seasonal Context:**
- Christmas delivery cut-off: Likely Dec 20-21 (based on 2024 pattern)
- Post-cut-off performance expected to decline further (2024: dropped to 86%)
- Current analysis represents PRE-cut-off performance

**Campaign Names:**
- Using cleaned names (T2MD prefix removed, standard " | " separators)
- Full campaign names preserved in Google Ads

## Next Steps

**For Gareth (Collaber Agency):**

**This Week (Pre-Christmas):**
1. ✅ Verify ROAS targets - check if Black Friday experiment (120% targets) still active
2. ✅ Implement Shopping Catch All daily budget cap (£600-800)
3. ✅ No immediate panic - seasonal compression expected, but monitor closely

**Early January (Post-Christmas):**
1. Review full Christmas period performance (Dec 8-31 once conversion data complete)
2. Analyse post-cut-off behaviour (Dec 21-31)
3. Schedule call to discuss January strategy and YoY efficiency recovery plan
4. Plan P Max HP&P deep-dive investigation

**Data Collection:**
- Let Dec 21st conversion data fully populate (check Dec 23-24)
- Product-level performance report for Dec 15-20 spend spike period
- Auction Insights for brand campaigns (affiliate check)
- Asset performance report for P Max HP&P
