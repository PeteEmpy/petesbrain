## Conversion Lag Update

**IMPORTANT:** This report replaces the 20 November interim report. Now that full conversion lag has cleared (3 days since period end), we can see the TRUE performance picture.

**Original Report (Nov 20) showed:**
- ROAS: 90% (lag-affected)
- Conversions: 26.3 (partial)

**Actual Performance (Lag-Cleared):**
- ROAS: 130% (+40pp vs interim report)
- Conversions: 87.4 (+232% vs interim)

**Conclusion:** The "performance collapse" flagged in the original report was largely due to conversion lag, not actual performance decline.

## Week-over-Week Analysis

### What Changed from Original Report?

The original report (generated Nov 20, using 14-18 Nov data with 2-day lag) showed:
- Three search campaigns "collapsed" to 0% ROAS
- Main PMax declining 34%
- Account ROAS at 90%

**With full lag cleared, we now see:**
1. **No campaign collapse** - the campaigns showing 0% were legacy/paused campaigns
2. **PMax performance stable** - 165% ROAS vs 167% last week (-2pp)
3. **Account ROAS healthy** - 130% vs 133% (-3pp)

### Actual Trends

**Daily Performance Pattern:**
- Spend reduced from £1,263 to £1,128 (-11%)
- Efficiency maintained (ROAS 130% vs 133%)
- Volume shift: More clicks (+45%) and impressions (+203%) but fewer conversions (-11%)

**Interpretation:** Market competition increasing for Christmas season. More people browsing but conversion rate declining slightly. This is normal seasonal behaviour.

## Key Learning: Conversion Lag Impact

This report demonstrates the critical importance of allowing conversion lag before analysis:

| Timing | ROAS Reported | Actual ROAS | Error |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| 2 days lag (Nov 20) | 90% | 130% | -40pp understatement |
| 3+ days lag (Nov 23) | 130% | 130% | Accurate |

**Recommendation:** Future weekly reports should:
1. Use full 7-day periods
2. Allow minimum 3-day lag before generation
3. Avoid alarm based on partially-lagged data
