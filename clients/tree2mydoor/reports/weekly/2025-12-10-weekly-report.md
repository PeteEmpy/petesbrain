**Key Takeaway:** Account showed increased spend and impressions week-over-week, but ROAS declined significantly (-27.8pp).

### Product-Level Concerns

**High-Spend, Below-Target Products:**
- **Olive Tree Gift - Large (5L pot):** £195 spend, 77.4% ROAS (vs 160% target) - *37% shortfall*
  - 129 clicks, only 6 conversions (4.7% conversion rate)
  - **Action:** Review product appeal, pricing, or ad copy positioning

- **At Peace Rose Bush:** £79 spend, 79.3% ROAS (vs 160% target) - *50% shortfall*
  - Memorial category typically strong, but underperforming this week
  - 134 clicks, 8 conversions (6.0% conversion rate)
  - **Action:** Check if holiday/seasonal trends are affecting memorial gift demand

**Outstanding Performers (Opportunity for Increased Budget):**
- **Fab at 80 Rose:** 311.6% ROAS (only £25 spend - significant underfunding)
- **Kaffir Lime Tree:** 1,040.7% ROAS (only £4 spend - likely statistical outlier with 1 conv, but worth monitoring)
- **Satsuma Tree:** 237.5% ROAS (£21 spend - underfunded high performer)

## Placement Analysis

**Account-level traffic acquisition pattern:**

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Total Impressions | 152,115 | 106,789 | +42.3% |
| Total Clicks | 2,301 | 1,568 | +46.7% |
| Spend | £2,087 | £1,355 | +54.0% |

**Impression Share Drivers (by campaign):**
- Search campaigns: Capped at 9.99% impression share (budget/bid limitations)
- Shopping campaigns: Maintaining 37-60% impression share (normal competitive range)
- Performance Max: 35.4% impression share (reasonable for competitive product category)

**Analysis:**
The 46.7% click increase outpaced revenue growth (11.3%), indicating significantly higher acquisition costs. This is driven by:
1. **CPC inflation:** Up 5.4% WoW (£0.86 → £0.91 per click)
2. **Lower conversion efficiency:** 2,301 clicks → 117 conversions (5.1% conversion rate vs. normal 6-7%)
3. **Broader match types:** More traffic but lower-quality sources

## Week-over-Week Trends

### Daily Performance Pattern (Week of Dec 4-10)

The past week showed elevated spend throughout, with particular pressure on:
- **Weekdays (Mon-Fri):** Normal spending levels, elevated CPCs
- **Weekend trend:** Consistent with seasonal shopping behavior

**Notable:** No extreme daily swings like the October Olive Tree incident, indicating feed stability has been maintained post-November verification.

### Performance vs. Target ROAS (160%)

| Campaign | Target | Actual | Gap | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|--------|
| P Max HP&P | 160% | 107.8% | -52.2pp | 🚨 Critical |
| Search Trees | 152% | 97.1% | -54.9pp | 🚨 Critical |
| Shopping Catch All | 150% | 139.5% | -10.5pp | ⚠️ Caution |
| Search Roses | 150% | 76.1% | -73.9pp | 🚨 Critical |
| P Max Unprofitable | 140% | 84.9% | -55.1pp | 🚨 Critical |

**Key Finding:** All major campaigns are underperforming target ROAS by 10-74 percentage points. This systematic shortfall across all campaign types suggests account-level issues rather than isolated campaign problems.

## Root Cause Analysis: ROAS Decline

### Why Did ROAS Fall from 146.9% to 106.1%?

**Hypothesis 1: CPC Inflation During Holiday Season**
- CPCs up 5.4% WoW (+£0.05)
- Holiday competitive auctions typically inflate CPCs 10-20%
- Early December shopping surge driving higher bids across category

**Hypothesis 2: Lower-Quality Traffic Volume**
- Impression share increased 42% while conversions flat (+0.3%)
- CTR increased only 2.6% despite 46.7% more clicks
- Suggests broader match type expansion capturing less-qualified searches

**Hypothesis 3: Product Mix Shift**
- Lower-performing products receiving proportional traffic increase
- Olive Tree Large (underperforming) received significant spend
- High-ROAS products (Fab at 80, Satsuma) underfunded

**Hypothesis 4: Seasonal Demand Compression**
- Q4 holiday gifting shifts from living gifts to more immediate gratification
- Rose bush ROAS typically stronger in gift occasions (Valentine's, Mother's Day) than holidays
- Memorial gifts (At Peace Rose) typically lower in December vs. other months

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. 🚨 **URGENT: Reduce Target ROAS on P Max Campaigns to Match Market Reality**
**Issue:** P Max campaigns set to 120% (after Black Friday experiment) but actually delivering 84.9-107.8% ROAS. Campaign is throttling spend due to target being unattainable in current market conditions.

**Impact:** This is likely causing under-delivery on your highest-volume campaigns. Every £1 of missed spend due to ROAS targets is direct revenue opportunity lost.

**Action:**
1. Check current P Max campaign ROAS targets in Google Ads
2. Evaluate if Black Friday ROAS reduction experiment (120%) is still active or has reverted
3. If still at 120%, this is below actual performance (107.8%) - targets can be slightly above reality but not dramatically below
4. Consider temporary adjustment to 110% during December competitive season, then revert to 140-150% in January

**Timeline:** TODAY - This is actively suppressing spend and revenue

### 2. ⚠️ **Review Keyword/Audience Expansion Settings**
**Issue:** 46.7% more clicks week-over-week but only 0.3% more conversions indicates significantly lower-quality traffic sources are being added.

**Symptoms:**
- CTR increased only 2.6% despite 46.7% more impressions (quality issue)
- Conversion rate dropped from ~7% to ~5.1% (down 27%)
- CPA increased 53.6% WoW (direct quality decline)

**Action:**
1. Review P Max HP&P campaign audience expansion: Is "Expand to Related Audiences" enabled? Consider reducing reach
2. Check Search campaigns' match types: Are negative keywords still effective? Add high-volume, low-conversion terms to negative list
3. Audit Keyword Planner suggestions: Are new keywords being auto-added? Evaluate relevance

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK - Systematically troubleshoot expansion settings

### 3. **Reduce Spend on Underperforming Products; Reallocate to High-ROAS Winners**
**Issue:** Budget being wasted on below-target products while high-ROAS products remain severely underfunded.

**Specific Actions:**
- **Olive Tree Gift - Large (5L):** 77.4% ROAS vs 160% target → Pause or drastically reduce bids. Review product copy, images, pricing.
- **At Peace Rose Bush:** 79.3% ROAS vs 160% target → Reduce keyword bids on this product, shift to other memorial options
- **Reallocate to:** Fab at 80 Rose (311.6%), Satsuma Tree (237.5%) - These clearly resonate with current audience

**Expected Impact:** +15-20 ROAS points by improving product mix efficiency

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK - Can implement immediately via Product Hero rules or manual bid adjustments

### 4. **Validate Search Campaign Performance - Investigate 76-97% ROAS**
**Issue:** Search campaigns significantly underperforming targets (150-160%), which is unusual for historically strong channel.

**Symptoms:**
- Search Trees: 97.1% ROAS (was 150%+ historically per CONTEXT.md)
- Search Roses: 76.1% ROAS (was 140-150%+ historically)

**Action:**
1. Pull top search terms report for both campaigns
2. Identify new, low-performing terms added recently (post-Black Friday)
3. Add low-performing terms to negative keyword list
4. Check bid adjustments: Have mobile/location bids been adjusted downward?
5. Verify keyword match types: Any broad match keywords performing below target?

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK - Search channel needs investigation before scaling

### 5. **Investigate Seasonal Demand Pattern (Lower Priority)**
**Issue:** Early December may show lower ROAS due to shifting from "living gifts" (slower delivery) to impulse purchases.

**Context:** December gift-giving typically favors immediate-gratification gifts vs. living plants that require care setup time.

**Action:**
1. Monitor next 3 weeks (through Dec 23) to see if ROAS recovers post-holiday
2. If sustained low ROAS into January, then investigate product mix/seasonality deeper
3. Consider holding current strategy; unlikely to improve significantly until New Year

**Timeline:** MONITOR ONLY - Hold current settings, evaluate at Dec 23 checkpoint
