## Placement Analysis

| Placement | Spend (14-18 Nov) | Conv Value | ROAS | Share of Spend |
|-----------|------------------|------------|------|----------------|
| **Google Search** | ~£573 | ~£517 | ~90% | ~100% |

**Insight:** Account is entirely focused on Google Search network with negligible Search Partners traffic. This is appropriate for Tree2MyDoor's direct-response e-commerce model.

## Week-over-Week Trends

**Daily Performance Pattern (Inferred from 5-day data):**

This report uses lag-adjusted data (excluding 19-20 Nov to account for 24-48 hour conversion lag). The concerning trends are:

1. **Conversion volume decline**: 40.1 → 26.3 conversions (-34%)
2. **Search campaign underperformance**: Multiple search campaigns showing zero conversions
3. **Product mix shift**: Top performers changed significantly WoW

**Conversion Lag Note:** Actual performance for 19-20 Nov still reporting in. Final week's true ROAS likely 10-15pp higher once lag clears.

## Prioritised Recommendations

### 1. 🚨 P0 - URGENT: Investigate Search Campaign Failures
**Issue:** Three search campaigns collapsed to 0% ROAS with zero conversions
**Impact:** £20/week wasted spend + lost opportunity on previously high-performing campaigns
**Action:**
1. Check Google Merchant Centre feed status for Anniversary roses and Olive Tree products
2. Verify product availability on website
3. Review search term reports for query quality degradation
4. Confirm conversion tracking is firing correctly on these product pages

**Timeline:** TODAY

---

### 2. P1 - Scale Catch All Shopping Campaign
**Issue:** Most improved campaign (+27pp ROAS, +19% conversions) but conservative budget
**Impact:** £150-200/month additional revenue opportunity
**Action:**
1. Increase daily budget from current level by 20-30%
2. Monitor for 5 days to confirm performance sustains

---

### 3. P1 - Optimize Product Feed for High-Spending Zero-ROAS Products
**Issue:** £28/week wasted on products with zero conversions
**Impact:** £120/month wasted budget

**Timeline:** THIS WEEK

---

### 4. P2 - Monitor Main PMax Campaign Conversion Lag
**Issue:** 34% conversion decline may be overstated due to lag
**Impact:** May cause premature budget cuts if misinterpreted

2. Compare 7-day rolling ROAS trend vs lag-adjusted snapshots
3. Document true performance before making strategic changes

**Timeline:** 22 NOVEMBER

---

### 5. P3 - Investigate Product Mix Shift
**Issue:** Top product changed from 2L Olive (£172) to Large Olive (£163) - different SKU
