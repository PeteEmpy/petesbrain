###  **Key Insights**

2. **Microsoft represents <3% of total paid search spend** but delivers strong efficiency
3. **Brand campaign focus** may explain higher ROAS (lower funnel traffic)
4. **Extreme budget limitation** prevents scale testing

---

## 💡 **Strategic Recommendations**

### 1. ✅ **Budget Reallocation - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Recommendation**: Gradually scale Microsoft Ads budget to test upper performance limits.

**Proposed Plan**:
- **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Increase daily budget from £7 to £20-25 (+186-257%)
- **Phase 2 (2 weeks)**: If ROAS holds >2.0x, increase to £50/day
- **Phase 3 (4 weeks)**: If ROAS holds >1.8x, increase to £100/day
- **Target allocation**: 10% of Google Ads budget (£800-1,000/month)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Even with 50% ROAS decline (2.75x → 1.38x), still matches Google Ads efficiency
- Likely outcome: ROAS 2.0-2.5x at £50-100/day spend
- Additional £1,000-2,000/month revenue potential

**Risk**: Low - current performance provides substantial buffer

### 2. 🔄 **Campaign Diversification**

**Current State**: Single active brand campaign

**Recommendation**: Reactivate select campaigns to diversify traffic sources:

| Priority | Campaign Type | Budget Allocation | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **P1** | Shopping - All Products | £15-20/day | Product-focused, high intent |
| **P2** | Search - Generic Trees | £10-15/day | Core product category |
| **P3** | Search - Seasonal/Occasions | £5-10/day | Occasion-based demand |

**Total additional budget**: £30-45/day (£900-1,350/month)

### 3. 📊 **Performance Monitoring**

**Establish monitoring framework**:

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **ROAS** | <1.60x for 7 days | Pause budget increase |
| **ROAS** | <1.30x for 3 days | Reduce budget 50% |
| **ROAS** | >2.50x for 14 days | Increase budget 50% |
| **Conv. Rate** | <3.0% for 7 days | Review campaign settings |

**Weekly reporting**: Track ROAS, spend, conversions vs Google Ads

### 4. 🎯 **Audience Expansion**

**Test new traffic sources** (when budget increases):
- Competitor brand terms (currently paused)
- Generic product terms (trees, plants, gifts)
- Remarketing campaigns (previously active)
- Shopping campaigns (multiple paused campaigns available)

### 5. 🔗 **Cross-Channel Learning**

**Leverage Google Ads insights** for Microsoft Ads:
- Apply ProfitMetrics profit-based bidding if possible
- Test successful Google product segments
- Replicate high-performing ad copy
- Apply seasonal learnings (current Google performance patterns)

## ⚠️ **Risks & Considerations**

### Budget Scaling Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **ROAS Compression** | Medium | Scale gradually, monitor weekly |
| **Limited Audience Size** | Low | Microsoft Ads UK reach is substantial |
| **Seasonality Impact** | Medium | Currently in peak season (Christmas) |
| **Brand Saturation** | Low | Single campaign, minimal brand exposure |

### Market Context

**Current Period (Nov 21 - Dec 20)**:
- Includes peak Christmas shopping period
- ROAS may be inflated by seasonal demand
- Post-Christmas performance will be critical indicator

**Recommendation**:
- Maintain aggressive budget through Christmas
- Re-evaluate in January 2026 for true baseline
- Compare January performance vs Google Ads January data

---

## 📋 **Action Items**

### Immediate (This Week)

1. ✅ **Increase budget** for "T2MD | Brand Max Conv" from £7/day to £20/day
2. ✅ **Reactivate** "Shopping (All Products)" campaign with £15/day budget
3. ✅ **Set up weekly reporting** to track ROAS vs Google Ads

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. ⏳ **Monitor performance** at new budget levels
5. ⏳ **Reactivate** 1-2 Search campaigns if ROAS holds >2.0x
6. ⏳ **Document seasonal baseline** for January comparison

### Medium-Term (Next Month)

7. ⏳ **Scale to £50-100/day** if performance supports
8. ⏳ **Diversify to 5-7 active campaigns** across campaign types
9. ⏳ **Implement profit-based tracking** if available for Microsoft Ads

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

Microsoft Ads represents a **significantly under-utilised channel** for Tree2MyDoor. Current performance (2.75x ROAS) far exceeds both the target (1.60x) and Google Ads actual performance (1.38x in September).

**Key Opportunity**: With <3% of paid search budget allocated to Microsoft Ads, there's substantial room for growth. Even conservative scaling to 10-15% of total budget could add £2,000-3,000/month in revenue with minimal risk.

**Critical Action**: Immediate budget increase is recommended to test scalability while maintaining current high efficiency.

**Next Steps**:
1. Present findings to Gareth (Collaber Agency)
2. Get approval for budget increase
3. Implement Phase 1 budget scaling
4. Monitor performance weekly
