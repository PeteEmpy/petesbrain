## Common Customer Questions and Answers

### Product Selection Questions

**Q1: How do I know which tree or plant to choose?**
A: Tree2MyDoor organizes gifts by occasion and meaning, not just by species. Browse by the occasion (birthday, memorial, anniversary, housewarming) at collections like /collections/birthday-gifts or /collections/memorial-gifts. Each product description explains the symbolism and care requirements. If still unsure, contact their customer service team for personalized guidance—they act as gifting guides, not salespeople.

**Q2: Will it fit in their garden or home?**
A: Many gifts are suitable for balconies, patios, and indoor spaces—you don't need a large garden. Houseplant gifts (/collections/indoor-plants) are specifically designed for limited spaces. Product pages include size information and space requirements. If uncertain, check the care guide at /pages/supporting-your-loved-one or contact customer service.

**Q3: Do they need to be good at gardening?**
A: No gardening expertise required. Every gift comes with simple care instructions and ongoing monthly MyTree™ care emails that provide seasonal guidance. Recipients receive support for the lifetime of the plant, making it accessible even for complete beginners.

**Q4: What's the best gift for someone who lives in an apartment?**
A: Direct them to /collections/indoor-plants for houseplant gifts designed specifically for indoor living. These require only sunlight and basic care—no outdoor space needed.

### Delivery and Logistics Questions

**Q5: Can I send it straight to the recipient, or should I send it to myself first?**
A: You can send directly to the recipient with confidence. Each gift arrives beautifully packaged with care instructions and a personal message option. The recipient will receive an invitation to register for MyTree™ care emails, ensuring they have ongoing support.

**Q6: How long does delivery take?**

**Q15: What happens if the recipient doesn't have time to care for it?**
