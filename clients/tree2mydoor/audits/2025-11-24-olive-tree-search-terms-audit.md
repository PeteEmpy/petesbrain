# Tree2MyDoor Search Term Audit: Search Campaign 598475433
**Date:** 24 November 2025
**Campaign:** T2MD | Search | Trees Port 150 16/6 Ai 4/8 Lemon paused 20/8 131 3/9 (ID: 598475433)
**Analysis Period:** 26 July - 23 November 2025 (120 days)
**Customer ID:** 4941701449

---

## Executive Summary

**Business Context:** Tree2MyDoor sells **gift trees** - gift-wrapped plants delivered to recipients. They are NOT a garden centre or nursery. Search terms with nursery/wholesale intent may perform on Shopping (where images show gift packaging) but waste budget on Search ads.

**Key Finding:** 120-day analysis identified £57+ in wasted spend on zero-conversion nursery-intent terms that should be blocked on Search campaigns while remaining available for Shopping/PMax.

**Action Taken:** 7 exact match negative keywords added to campaign 598475433.

## Methodology

1. Pulled 120-day search term data (26 Jul - 23 Nov 2025) for campaign 598475433
2. Identified all terms with >£5 spend and zero conversions
3. Cross-referenced against Tree2MyDoor product catalogue (Merchant Centre ID: 107469209)
4. Validated that proposed negatives wouldn't block products they sell
5. Confirmed terms with nursery/wholesale intent vs gift intent

**Important Note:** Initial 30-day analysis was misleading. Terms like "olive trees for sale" showed 0 conversions in 30 days but 212% ROAS over 120 days. Extended analysis prevented incorrect blocking of profitable terms.

## Rationale for Blocked Terms

### "olive trees in pots" - £34.94, 0 conv
- Highest-spend zero-conversion term
- Indicates gardening/nursery intent (looking for potted plants to grow)
- No gift language in query
- Shopping ads can still serve (visual shows gift packaging)

### "lemon tree" - £30.75, 0 conv
- Generic nursery query
- Compare to "lemon tree gift" which converts at 329% ROAS
- Adding "gift" changes intent entirely

### "lemon trees for sale" - £10.89, 0 conv
- Explicit wholesale/nursery language
- "for sale" indicates price shopping, not gift buying

### "small olive tree in pot" - £6.40, 0 conv
- Specific nursery query (size + container)
- No gift intent signals

### "twisted olive tree" - £5.46, 0 conv
- Variety-specific nursery query
- Gardeners looking for a specific tree type, not a gift

### "bay trees for sale" - £5.01, 0 conv
- Wholesale/nursery language
- Note: They DO sell bay trees, but "for sale" indicates non-gift intent

### "olive trees for sale uk" - £4.83, 0 conv
- Location-specific wholesale query
- Different from "olive trees for sale" which converts (broader intent)

### "the present tree olive tree" - £2.08, 0 conv
- Competitor brand "The Present Tree"
- Users searching for competitor, not Tree2MyDoor

## Recommendations for Future Monitoring

### Watch List (May Need Blocking)
| Term | Current Spend | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| indoor olive trees | £2.51 | Low spend, monitor |
| small olive tree | £1.42 | Low spend, monitor |
| lemon tree for sale | £3.57 | Similar to blocked terms |
| olive tree indoors | £2.05 | Indoor = houseplant shopper |

### Landing Page Investigation
These gift-intent terms have zero conversions - investigate why:
- tree present (£10.30)
- tree gifts (£3.49)
- gift olive tree (£3.04)
- tree as a gift (£2.22)

### Bid Adjustments
Consider reducing bids (not blocking) on:
- Brand + discount terms (price shoppers)
- Generic tree terms without "gift" modifier
