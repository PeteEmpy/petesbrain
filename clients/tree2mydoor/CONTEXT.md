## Strategic Context

### Current Strategy
- **Campaign Structure**: Performance Max heavy, segmented by profitability (Profitable/Unprofitable split). Recently tested Roses vs Non-Roses segmentation (Oct 2025 - later reverted)
- **Bidding Strategy**: Target ROAS (recently reduced in Oct 2025 due to traffic slowdown)
- **Key Focus Areas**: Profit optimization via ProfitMetrics, feed management via Channable, seasonal performance management

### Why This Approach?
- **ProfitMetrics Integration**: Using profit-based conversion values (not just revenue) to optimize for true margins at SKU level
- **Channable Feed Management**: Automated product feed optimization and management
- **Performance Max Focus**: Leverages Google's automation while maintaining control through asset groups and feed rules
- **Product Hero Integration**: Advanced product-level automation and optimization

### Goals & KPIs
**Primary Goal**: Maximize profit while maintaining growth
**Target ROAS**: 1.60x (account-level blended target per Gareth's Oct 2025 brief)
**Target CPA**: [TBD]
**Other KPIs**:
- Tier A PMax: ≥1.80x POAS
- Tier B: ≥1.45x POAS
- Tier C: ≥1.35x POAS or throttle

**September 2025 Actual Performance**:
- Spend: £8,231
- Revenue: £11,351
- ROAS: 1.38x
- Conversions: 733

## Historical Performance Patterns

### Seasonality
- **Peak Seasons**: [TBD - likely Spring, Mother's Day, Christmas]
- **Slow Seasons**: September shows clear seasonal decline (September 2025: -17.4% revenue vs August)
- **Expected Patterns**:
  - August to September typically shows decline (confirmed in 2024 and 2025)
  - 2025 seasonal declines more pronounced than 2024

### Year-Over-Year Trends
- **2024 vs 2025**: September 2025 showed strong YoY growth: +47.5% spend, +23.8% revenue vs Sep 2024
- **Growth Rate**: Growing YoY despite seasonal fluctuations
- **Performance Benchmarks**: ROAS in 1.35-1.50x range typical, with seasonal compression in autumn

### Known Anomalies
- **October 2025 PMax Split Test**: Split campaigns into Roses vs Non-Roses (Oct 20), then reverted on Oct 23 - likely didn't perform as expected
- **ROAS Compression September 2025**: ROAS declined 6.9% MoM (1.48x→1.38x), more severe than 2024's pattern
- **October 26-28 Click Spike**: Campaign "T2MD | P Max | HP&P Roses" experienced 316% click increase (226 → 2,630 clicks/day)
  - **Root Cause Identified (Oct 29)**: Product 01090 (The Olive Tree Gift - £28.99, 2L pot) was flickering in/out of Google Merchant Center feed multiple times per day
  - **Timeline**: Product removed and re-added Oct 25, 26, 27, 28; on Oct 29 alone flickered 4 times (removed/added/removed/added)
  - **Why This Caused Spike**: Google's algorithm treats repeatedly re-added products as "new inventory" each time, giving them auction priority
  - **Impact**: Oct 28 peak - 1,465 clicks (56% of all campaign clicks), up from 8-30 clicks/day baseline; CPC dropped 76% (£0.50 → £0.12)
  - **Likely Cause**: Stock synchronization issues - product going in/out of stock rapidly in inventory system
  - **Client Response (Oct 30)**: Gareth confirmed high-profile press coverage for Olive Trees in large readership magazines during this period, driving direct traffic
  - **Combined Effect Analysis**: Press coverage likely created brand awareness → increased branded/category searches → higher CTR on paid ads when product appeared. The Merchant Center feed flickering amplified this by giving the product algorithmic priority at the exact moment demand was elevated. Result: Perfect storm of increased demand + algorithmic boost = massive click spike on paid ads.
  - **Strategic Learning**: Press coverage can significantly amplify paid search performance when product availability is stable. However, feed instability during high-demand periods can cause unpredictable cost spikes. Future press campaigns should be coordinated with enhanced feed monitoring to ensure stable inventory data.
  - **Current Status**: Product active at £28.99 and performing well when stable
  - **Analysis doc**: `/clients/tree2mydoor/click-spike-analysis-oct-2025.md`
  - **Key Learning**: Feed instability causes severe algorithmic disruption. Need stable stock levels for high performers. Enhanced tracking now enabled to catch price/availability changes immediately.

## Business Context

### Product/Service Details

**Business Model**: UK-based living gift company specializing in trees, rose bushes, and houseplants as meaningful, lasting gifts. Founded in 2003 (22+ years in business), based in Manchester.

**USP**:
- **Living gifts that grow** - Trees and plants as meaningful alternatives to traditional gifts, creating lasting memories
- **MyTree™ care service** - Up to a year of tailored planting and aftercare support included with each gift (peace of mind guarantee)
- **Expertly grown** - Over 100 tree and plant varieties from native British species to handpicked international varieties
- **Personalised experience** - Custom cards, eco-friendly packaging, choose delivery date
- **Planet-conscious** - Eco-friendly packaging, sustainable gifting philosophy
- **Small space friendly** - Many plants thrive in small gardens, patios, or indoor spaces (addresses common barrier)
- **Award-winning service** - Recognised quality and customer service
- **Symbolic meaning** - Products chosen for beauty, symbolism, and connection (olive trees for peace, oak for legacy, roses for milestones)

**Target Market**: 
- **Primary**: UK consumers seeking meaningful gifts for birthdays, anniversaries, memorials, Christmas, Mother's Day
- **Secondary**: Corporate gifting, memorial/sympathy gifts, milestone celebrations
- **Demographics**: Environmentally conscious, gift-givers seeking alternatives to traditional presents

**Top Performers** (September 2025 by spend):
- At Peace Rose Bush Gift: £595 spend, 1.27x ROAS, 78 conversions
- The Olive Tree Gift - Large: £511 spend, 1.35x ROAS, 26 conversions
- Diamond 60th Anniversary Rose: £359 spend, 1.49x ROAS, 45 conversions
- Lemon Tree Gift - Large: £337 spend, 1.37x ROAS, 16 conversions
- Fab at 70 Rose Bush Gift: £271 spend, 1.59x ROAS, 30 conversions

**Key Product Categories**:
- Memorial/sympathy roses (At Peace series)
- Anniversary roses (Diamond 60th, Ruby 40th, Golden 50th, etc.)
- Birthday roses (Fab at 40/50/60/70 series - new ad groups added Oct 2025)
- Citrus trees (Lemon, Orange)
- Olive trees (various sizes)
- Mini plants (Mini Myrtle)

**Product Hero Label Segmentation** (Performance-Based Categories - Used in Google Ads campaigns):
- **Plan Level**: Pro Plan (€60/month total - multiple accounts)
- **Heroes & Sidekicks (H&S)** - Top-performing products (Heroes = top revenue generators, Sidekicks = good converters needing more visibility)
- **Villains** - Underperforming products that drain budget but have optimization potential
- **Zombies** - Products with no conversions/impressions or very poor performance
- Products classified by Product Hero based on performance data
- Campaigns structured around these labels to optimize budget allocation and bidding strategy

**Note**: Campaign names referencing "Heroes & Sidekicks", "H&S", "Villains", and "Zombies" refer to Product Hero performance labels, not actual product categories. Product Hero automatically classifies products based on performance data and syncs these labels to Google Merchant Center for campaign segmentation.

**Pricing Strategy**: Mid-market, gift-focused pricing
**Average Order Value**: ~£15.50 (calculated from Sep 2025: £11,351 revenue / 733 conversions)
**Typical Margins**: [Tracked via ProfitMetrics - actual margins TBD]

### Website & Technical

**Website Platform**: Shopify
**Recent Changes**: Website relaunched October 2025 (Gareth managing "tech tidyup")

**Known Technical Issues**:
- Stock/inventory instability affecting campaign learning (noted in Gareth's Oct 2025 email)
- SKU/variant handling resets learning on bestsellers
- OOS (out of stock) events disrupt Performance Max momentum

**Conversion Tracking**:
- **Setup**: ProfitMetrics for profit-based conversion values, integrated with Google Ads
- **CRITICAL**: The `conversions_value` field in Google Ads API represents **PROFIT**, not revenue
  - All ROAS calculations should be called **POAS (Profit on Ad Spend)** to avoid confusion
  - Example: £100 spend generating £160 profit = 160% POAS (not ROAS)
  - This is the actual profit margin per product, not gross revenue
- **Known Issues**: Need to confirm Google Ads is optimizing to ProfitMetrics profit value (not just revenue)
- **Last Audit**: [TBD]

### Competitive Landscape

**Main Competitors**: [TBD]

**Competitive Advantages**: [From llms.txt work done Oct 2025 - TBD]

**Competitive Disadvantages**:
- Potential affiliate bidding on brand terms (concern raised by Gareth Oct 2025)
- CPC inflation outpacing CTR/CVR gains

---

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Issues
- **Profit compression at scale** (Oct 2025): Account-level POAS below target despite higher impression share; CPC inflation outpacing efficiency gains
- **Stock instability** (Oct 2025): OOS events and SKU handling repeatedly reset learning on bestsellers
- **PMax control limitations** (Oct 2025): Current Profitable/Unprofitable split not giving enough budget control by margin theme or category
- **Affiliate brand bidding** (Oct 2025): Concern that affiliates may be bidding on Tree2mydoor brand terms, driving up CPCs

### Recurring Challenges
- Seasonal ROAS compression (autumn transition particularly challenging)
- Balancing growth (spend) with profitability (ROAS)
- Feed/stock stability affecting campaign learning phases

### External Factors to Monitor
- Seasonality - September-October shows consistent decline pattern
- CPC inflation in competitive auction environment
- Stock availability from suppliers

---

## Key Learnings & Insights

### What Works Well
- **PMax title optimization**: Improved visibility and CTR in competitive auctions
- **Pricing experiments**: "Sale" presentation on select SKUs lifted engagement and conversions
- **Non-brand Search**: Rose/memorial themes efficient and scalable
- **Birthday segmentation**: New "Fab at 40/50/60/70" ad groups created Oct 2025 with AI-generated ads showing good quality scores
- **Product Hero + Channable automation**: Advanced product-level management working well

### What Doesn't Work
- **Broad Profitable/Unprofitable PMax split**: Not enough granular control by margin/category
- **Roses vs Non-Roses split**: Tested Oct 20, reverted Oct 23 - didn't perform as expected
- **Phone calls with Gareth**: Doesn't retain information - must use email or recorded meetings

### Successful Tests & Experiments
| Date | Test Description | Result | Action Taken |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Oct 2025 | Pricing experiments with "sale" presentation | Lifted engagement & conversions | Continue monitoring |
| Oct 2025 | Birthday ad groups (Fab at 40/50/60/70) with AI ads | Good quality scores | Monitor performance |

### Failed Tests (Learn From)
| Date | Test Description | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Oct 20-23, 2025 | Split PMax into Roses vs Non-Roses campaigns | Reverted after 3 days | Segmentation by product type alone insufficient - need margin/intent-based structure |

---

## Campaign-Specific Notes

### Performance Max Campaigns (Primary)
- **Purpose**: Main revenue driver
- **Structure**: Currently Profitable vs Unprofitable split (to be restructured to Tier A/B/C per Gareth's Oct proposal)
- **Performance Notes**: Drives majority of spend and revenue but mixed profitability signals
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Requires close monitoring of product performance and audience targeting during seasonal shifts
  - Asset groups need theme-based segmentation (Memorial, Anniversary, Citrus, Olive)

### Search Campaigns
- **Purpose**: Non-brand search (brand handled separately)
- **Structure**: Rose/memorial themed campaigns
- **Performance Notes**: Efficient and scalable
- **Special Considerations**: Good performance pocket worth expanding

### [Other campaigns TBD]

---

## Product Hero Settings

### Current Configuration (Last Updated: 2025-10-01)

**Product Hero Plan**: Pro Plan (€60/month total - multiple accounts)

**Target ROAS**: 160% (1.60x account-level blended target)
**Actual ROAS Achieved**: 209%

**Performance Gap**: Actual ROAS +49 points above target (209% vs 160%)

**Rationale**: Account-level blended target established per Gareth's Oct 2025 brief. ROAS target recently reduced in Oct 2025 due to traffic slowdown. Product performing well above target indicates room for further optimization or volume growth.

**Campaign Structure**: Currently using Profitable vs Unprofitable split; to be restructured to Tier A/B/C per Gareth's proposal (Oct 2025).

**Related Methodology**: [Product Hero Labelizer System](/Users/administrator/Documents/PetesBrain.nosync/roksys/knowledge-base/rok-methodologies/product-hero-labelizer-system.md)

### Settings Change History

| Date | Setting | Previous | New | Rationale | Result |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-01 | Target ROAS | [Higher] | 160% | Traffic slowdown, account-level blended target per Gareth's brief | Actual: 209% (+49 points) |

**Note**: Product Hero automatically classifies products daily as Heroes/Sidekicks/Villains/Zombies based on performance. These labels sync to Google Merchant Center and guide campaign structure. Target ROAS settings control the algorithm's bidding aggressiveness. Campaign restructure from Profitable/Unprofitable to Tier A/B/C planned.

### [Tree2Mydoor] Review Olive Tree (Product 01090) Merchant Center feed stability
<!-- task_id: bU95dGdlcFNueUJSdlJhSw -->
**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-11-12, verified 2025-11-14)

**COMPLETED - Performance Summary (Nov 12, 2025):**

✅ **Product has stabilized** - No more extreme volatility like the Oct 28 spike (1,463 clicks)

**Pre-spike baseline (Oct 20-26):** 8-30 clicks/day, 1,500-2,500 impressions/day

**Post-spike stability (Nov 1-11):** Consistently 18-35 clicks/day (avg ~25/day), 2,300-3,600 impressions/day with regular conversions (2-4 most days)

**Key Finding:** Product stabilized at HIGHER baseline than pre-spike. Algorithm appears to have recalibrated positively after the Oct 27-28 event.

**One anomaly:** Nov 6 showed 0 clicks (only 24 impressions), suggesting brief feed issue, but performance resumed normally Nov 7+.

**Follow-up Verification (Nov 14, 2025):**
- Nov 8-13 performance: 209% ROAS, 10 conversions, stable clicks/impressions
- No signs of feed flickering or volatility
- Product performing well above target ROAS (209% vs 160% target)
- Analysis saved: `/clients/tree2mydoor/documents/olive-tree-01090-verification-2025-11-14.md`

**Conclusion:** Feed flickering has stopped. Product now performing consistently well at elevated baseline. Continue standard monitoring - no immediate action required.

### [Tree2mydoor] REVERT ROAS from 120% back to 140% - Black Friday experiment ends
<!-- task_id: clNZX0xfSnowZmVkZFA3Nw -->
**Status:** 📋 In Progress  

**CRITICAL - Time-limited experiment**

Black Friday ROAS reduction experiment:
- Changed: Nov 24, 2025
- Revert by: Tuesday Nov 25

Campaigns changed from → to:
- P Max HP&P: 140% → 120%
- P Max Unprofitable: 140% → 120%
- Search Roses: 150% → 120%
- Shopping Catch All: 150% → 120%
- Shopping Low Traffic: 140% → 120%

**REVERT ALL TO ORIGINAL VALUES unless performance significantly improved**

Check before reverting:
1. Impression share - has it recovered?
2. Spend - is it pacing higher?
3. ROAS - is it holding above breakeven?

If ROAS drops below 100% or spend explodes, revert immediately.

<!-- task_id: bVdZZURmdjZmQ0ZwV2QyUg -->
**Status:** 📋 In Progress

Paused "Brand Tree To My Door" (22485131646) on Nov 24, 2025.

- Re-enable paused campaign if failing

**Check:**
1. Pull Brand Inclusion performance Nov 24 - Dec 24
2. Compare conversions to 30.1 baseline
3. Check search terms for any brand queries being missed
