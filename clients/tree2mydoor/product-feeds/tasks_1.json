Review performance of all brand campaigns (clicks, conversions, ROAS, CPC)\n2. Analyze overlap and cannibalization between campaigns\n3. Check search term reports for query coverage\n4. Determine optimal brand campaign structure\n5. Apply Nils Rooijmans' LOW-priority methodology if using Shopping campaigns\n6.
