# Tree2MyDoor

Tree2MyDoor helps people and organisations give with life (not waste), through meaningful, nature-based gifts that grow, connect and last.

## Overview

Tree2MyDoor is the UK's original living gift company, established in 2003. The company guides individuals and businesses to choose living gifts that show love, strengthen connection, and leave a positive mark on the planet. Unlike traditional gift retailers focused on short-lived or disposable items, Tree2MyDoor specializes in trees, rose bushes, and houseplants that serve as enduring symbols of growth, remembrance, and renewal.

Each gift is backed by the MyTree™ lifetime care promise, which provides recipients with simple monthly guidance and ongoing support to ensure their living gift thrives. To date, the company has contributed to a growing network of over 500,000 trees planted, creating gifts that heal the planet while honoring people.

Tree2MyDoor operates on a philosophy of guidance rather than sales, offering calm, clear assistance to help customers navigate the overwhelming landscape of modern gifting. The company serves as a trusted partner for those seeking to reconnect with the true meaning of giving—whether celebrating milestones, expressing love, honoring memories, or building corporate culture with purpose.
