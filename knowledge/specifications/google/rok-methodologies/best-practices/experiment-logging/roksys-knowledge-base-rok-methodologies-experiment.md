## Summary

- Be specific and factual in experiment description - avoid vague terms like 'optimizing campaigns'
- Include business/performance reasoning - explain what problem you're solving or opportunity capturing
- Quantify expectations with specific numbers - not 'performance will improve' but '+10% diary revenue'
- Set review dates based on change type - structural (14-28d), budget (7-14d), bidding (14-21d), creative (30+d)
- Define minimum acceptable outcomes and clear win criteria for success
