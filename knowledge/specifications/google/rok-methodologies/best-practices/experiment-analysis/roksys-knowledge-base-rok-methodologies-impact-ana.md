## Summary

- Run analysis on experiment review date set during logging
- Pull equal-length before/after periods for fair comparison
- Verify implementation in Change History before analyzing results
- Check for confounding factors (other changes, external events) that could skew results
- Document whether experiment beat, met, or missed target for each success criterion

- Run analysis on experiment review date set during logging
- Pull equal-length before/after periods for fair comparison
- Verify implementation in Change History before analyzing results
- Check for confounding factors (other changes, external events) that could skew results
- Document whether experiment beat, met, or missed target for each success criterion
- Use statistical significance testing when sufficient data available
- Present rollout recommendations (Full Rollout, Partial Rollout, Rollback, Continue Test) with clear reasoning
- Automated by Claude Code with user approval for final decisions
- Segment performance data by relevant dimensions (campaign, product, region) for deeper insights
