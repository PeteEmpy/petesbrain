## Summary

- Don't accept implementation as complete until functionality is verified with Google technical team
- Schedule validation meeting as part of initial implementation scope, not as separate request
- When requesting follow-up technical support, clearly state: 'This is a follow-on from previous tech call, need same specialist'
- Push for specific action when support requests drag on - escalate through management chain if needed
- Document all implementation milestones and blockers to demonstrate progress and sticking points during escalations

- Schedule validation meeting as part of initial implementation scope, not as separate request
- When requesting follow-up technical support, clearly state: 'This is a follow-on from previous tech call, need same specialist'
- Push for specific action when support requests drag on - escalate through management chain if needed
- Document all implementation milestones and blockers to demonstrate progress and sticking points during escalations
- Maintain client expectations during extended support resolution periods - communicate delays proactively
- When receiving generic support responses after technical onboarding, immediately clarify that you need hands-on troubleshooting
- Ensure meeting invitations include all critical context: client ID, case number, client name, all stakeholder email addresses
- For implementations spanning multiple weeks/months, create clear tracking document of: dates, contacts, issues, resolutions
- When primary support contact is unavailable for extended period, establish single point of contact for continuity
- Set clear expectations with Google support about turnaround time for follow-up technical meetings
- If support communication becomes confusing, pause and request clarification call to reset expectations and next steps
- Build buffer time into client implementation timelines to account for potential Google support delays
- Keep client informed throughout extended troubleshooting - don't let them discover delays indirectly
