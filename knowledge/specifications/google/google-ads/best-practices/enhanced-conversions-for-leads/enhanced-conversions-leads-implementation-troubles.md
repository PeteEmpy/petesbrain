- Include all relevant stakeholders (agency contact and client technical contact) in technical support invitations
- Track case numbers throughout implementation lifecycle for reference continuity
- When primary Google rep goes on extended leave, immediately establish handover with manager and document ongoing technical issues
- Schedule post-implementation validation meetings before declaring setup complete
- Test offline data imports with small datasets first to identify format issues early
- Document timestamp format specifications during initial technical meeting to prevent later errors
- Escalate through proper chain when support becomes fragmented: Growth Strategist -> SMB Head -> Support Coordination
- Push back on support inefficiencies when client has already completed onboarding and needs specific troubleshooting
- Maintain clear communication about what stage of implementation you're at when requesting follow-up support
- For complex technical implementations, establish clear milestones and validation checkpoints with Google technical team upfront
