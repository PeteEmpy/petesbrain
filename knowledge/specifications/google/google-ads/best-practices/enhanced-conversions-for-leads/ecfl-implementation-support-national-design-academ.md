## Summary

- ECFL requires multiple touchpoints: setup call, implementation, and post-implementation verification - plan for all three phases
- Offline conversion imports require precise timestamp formatting - verify format with Google tech team before first import
- Common failure point is timestamp formatting even when format was 'agreed upon' - require dedicated technical review for troubleshooting
- Include ALL stakeholders (client contacts, technical implementers, account managers) in technical support invites
- When primary Google rep is out of office, ensure complete context transfer including: client IDs, case numbers, all stakeholder emails

- Offline conversion imports require precise timestamp formatting - verify format with Google tech team before first import
- Common failure point is timestamp formatting even when format was 'agreed upon' - require dedicated technical review for troubleshooting
- Include ALL stakeholders (client contacts, technical implementers, account managers) in technical support invites
- When primary Google rep is out of office, ensure complete context transfer including: client IDs, case numbers, all stakeholder emails
- Create clear case numbers for tracking technical issues through escalation process
- ECFL issues are often format-related rather than setup-related - don't assume code implementation is the problem
- Request verification calls specifically to review both conversion tracking code AND offline conversion data format
- Google support escalation can create communication gaps - proactively follow up to ensure continuity
- Verify all meeting invites include correct client ID and complete stakeholder list before scheduled time
