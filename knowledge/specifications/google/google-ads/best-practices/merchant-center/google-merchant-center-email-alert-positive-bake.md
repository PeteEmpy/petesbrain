## Summary

- Recognize that 6-hour sudden drops indicate technical issues (feed problems, sync failures, policy violations) not gradual inventory changes
- For Local Inventory Ads drops, investigate local product feed, store availability data, and Google My Business integration first
- Use the diagnostics link with pre-filtered parameters to quickly identify specific items and issues causing the drop
- Take immediate action as dropped items have complete loss of visibility across all Google products, directly impacting revenue
- Check for feed upload failures, inventory sync errors, and data quality violations during the detection window
