## Summary

- Do not treat CTR as a primary success metric - focus on qualified clicks from the right audience over high click volumes
- Recognize that lower CTR can indicate better ad targeting and pre-qualification, filtering out unqualified traffic
- Prioritize conversion quality over click volume to reduce wasted ad spend on unqualified users
- Focus on impression share and qualified traffic strategies for more efficient spending
- Measure campaign success by downstream metrics (conversions, ROI, CPA) rather than top-of-funnel engagement metrics like CTR
