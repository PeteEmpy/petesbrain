Hold current budgets through Nov 24 (complete 14-day learning minimum)\n2. Review 7-day aggregate ROAS Nov 13-20 before any adjustments\n3. Expect continued volatility - don't react to single-day drops\n4. Retargeting could sustain budget increases if needed (running 502% ROAS)\n\n**Strategic Context:**\n- Top-of-funnel awareness campaigns expected lower ROAS than core (550%+)\n- Combined performance feeding retargeting funnel successfully\n- Grandparent targeting (60+) showing promise in video placements\n\n**Next review:** Nov 24 (14-day learning phase completion)",
