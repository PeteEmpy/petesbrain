      "notes": "**From Weekly Report - Dec 22, 2025**\n\n**Issue:** Account POAS 28pp lower than same period last year (153% vs 180%)\n\n**Most Likely Root Cause:**\n- Black Friday experiment (Nov 24th) reduced campaign ROAS targets from 140-150% to 120%\n- Task in CONTEXT.md notes \"Revert by Tuesday Nov 25\" but unclear if this happened\n- If still at 120% targets, this explains systematic POAS compression across all campaigns\n\n**Actions Required:**\n1. Check current ROAS/POAS targets in Google Ads for these campaigns:\n   - P Max HP&P (should be 150% if reverted, 120% if experiment still running)\n   - P Max Unprofitable (should be 150%)\n   - Search Roses (should be 150%)\n   - Shopping Catch All (should be 150%)\n   - Shopping Low Traffic (should be 140%)\n\n2. If still at 120% experimental levels:\n   - Revert to pre-experiment targets immediately\n   - Monitor 48-hour post-reversion performance\n   - Document in CONTEXT.md that reversion completed\n\n3. If already at correct levels:\n   - Document that experiment was properly reverted\n   - Investigate other causes of YoY POAS decline (P Max HP&P investigation becomes priority)\n\n**Context:**\n- YoY comparison: Dec 8-20, 2025 (153% POAS) vs Dec 8-20, 2024 (180% POAS)\n- Seasonal compression is normal, but magnitude is 3x worse than last year\n- Week 2 (Dec 15-20) showed severe compression: 134% POAS with some unprofitable days\n\n**Timeline:** Complete by Wednesday 25th December\n\nFull report: clients/tree2mydoor/reports/weekly/2025-12-22-weekly-report.md\n",

      "notes": "**Context**: Business rules translate raw performance data into automated alerts based on client economics and expectations.\n\n**What Smythson Has (Reference)**:\n- ROAS monitoring rule: Alert if ROAS <379% (15% below 446% target)\n- Seasonal adjustments: 1,000% target during Christmas (Dec 24-28), 800% during Black Friday\n- Qualification criteria: £500 min spend, 5+ conversions\n- Automatic detection in weekly reports\n\n**What You Need to Do**:\n\n1. **Research Target ROAS** (5 mins)\n   - Read `clients/tree2mydoor/CONTEXT.md`\n   - Find current target ROAS (or CPA if lead generation)\n   - Target: Check CONTEXT.md\n   - Business model: E-commerce (Christmas trees, plants)\n   - Highly seasonal business. Check CONTEXT.md for current target ROAS and seasonal patterns.\n\n2. **Define Business Rule** (10 mins)\n   - Calculate threshold: Target × 0.85 (15% tolerance)\n   - Example: If target = 400%, threshold = 340%\n   - Set qualification criteria:\n     - E-commerce: £500 min spend, 5+ conversions\n     - Lead gen: £500 min spend, 3+ leads\n   - Seasonal considerations: CRITICAL: Peak season Oct-Dec, off-season Jan-Sep\n\n3. **Add to `shared/business_rules.py`** (15 mins)\n   - Copy `SmythsonRules` class as template\n   - Create `Tree2mydoorRules` class\n   - Update `check_campaign_against_rules()` function\n   - Add elif block for this client\n\n4. **Document in CONTEXT.md** (10 mins)\n   - Add \"📊 Business Rules (Automated Alert Thresholds)\" section\n   - Document:\n     - Target ROAS and threshold calculation\n     - Qualification criteria\n     - Seasonal adjustments (if applicable)\n     - Rationale (why these thresholds)\n     - Next review date (quarterly)\n\n5. **Test with Real Data** (15 mins)\n   - Create test script (copy `shared/test_real_smythson_data_dec_2025.py`)\n   - Query last 7 days of data\n   - Verify alerts trigger correctly\n   - Check for false positives/negatives\n\n6. **Validate in Weekly Report** (5 mins)\n   - Run next weekly report for this client\n   - Verify \"⚠️ Business Rule Alerts\" section appears\n   - Check alerts are meaningful and actionable\n\n**Files to Create/Modify**:\n- `shared/business_rules.py` - Add Tree2mydoorRules class\n- `clients/tree2mydoor/CONTEXT.md` - Add business rules section\n- `shared/test_real_tree2mydoor_data.py` - Validation test (optional but recommended)\n\n**Example Reference**:\n- See: `clients/smythson/CONTEXT.md` (lines 42-63) - Business rules documentation\n- See: `shared/business_rules.py` (lines 139-280) - SmythsonRules implementation\n- See: `clients/smythson/documents/business-rules-validation-dec-2025.md` - Validation report example\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n✅ Business rule class added to `business_rules.py`\n✅ CONTEXT.md updated with thresholds and rationale\n✅ Weekly report shows business rule alerts (if violations exist)\n✅ No false positives (alerts on good performance)\n✅ Catches genuine issues (low ROAS with significant spend)\n\n**Time Estimate**: 60 minutes total\n**Depends On**: Understanding of client's target ROAS and business model\n**Next Step After**: Run weekly report to validate alerts work correctly\n\n**Related Documentation**:\n- `/docs/BUSINESS-RULES-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full implementation guide\n- `/docs/SEASONAL-VARIANCE-ANALYSIS-SMYTHSON.md` - Seasonal analysis example\n- `/clients/smythson/documents/sale-periods-calendar-2025-2026.md` - Calendar format example\n",
