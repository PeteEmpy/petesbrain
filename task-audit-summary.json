WooCommerce data shows demand exists but Google Ads shows \u00a30 attributed revenue. This test validates whether direct advertising drives incremental sales.\n\n**Metrics to Review at Day 7 (Dec 18):**\n1. **Volume Metrics:**\n   - Impressions (total, daily average)\n   - Clicks (total, daily average, CTR)\n   - Conversions (count, conversion rate)\n\n2. **Revenue Metrics:**\n   - Revenue attributed by Google Ads\n   - ROAS achieved vs 150% target\n   - Cost per conversion\n   - Compare to WooCommerce actuals (May reveal attribution gaps)\n\n3. **Product-Level Performance:**\n   - Product 14332 (Rope Barrier 10-pack) metrics separately\n   - Product 8025 (Belt Barrier 10-pack) metrics separately\n   - Compare performance between the two products\n\n4. **Cannibalization Check:**\n   - Monitor 4-pack (Product 7969) and 6-pack (Product 8017) performance\n   - Check if 10-pack campaign is stealing volume from existing packs\n   - If major cannibalization detected, may need to adjust strategy\n\n5. **Feed Status:**\n   - Verify both products remain approved in Merchant Center\n   - Check for any feed errors or disapprovals\n   - Confirm conversion tracking is working\n\n**Decision Framework (Dec 18 Review):**\n- **ROAS \u2265 150%**: Campaign is meeting targets \u2192 Scale up budget by 20-30%\n- **ROAS 100-149%**: Underperforming but viable \u2192 Continue at same budget, review messaging/targeting, collect more data\n- **ROAS < 100%**: Below profitability threshold \u2192 Pause campaign, investigate root cause (pricing, positioning, targeting too broad)\n\n**Next Actions (Post-Review):**\n1. Document findings in: clients/crowd-control/documents/10pack-campaign-review-[DATE].md\n2. Send performance summary to Jeremy with recommendation\n3. If continuing, schedule follow-up review for Dec 25 (2-week mark) for more conclusive data\n4. Monitor daily for first 7 days to catch any critical issues early\n\n**Related Analysis:**\n- Initial investigation: clients/crowd-control/documents/email-posts-stands-analysis-and-next-steps-2025-12-10.html\n- Product-level data: Google Ads Product Impact Analyzer (Product IDs 14332, 8025)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Achieves 150% ROAS target (indicates product demand is real)\n- Generates \u00a3200+ revenue in first 7 days\n- No major cannibalization from existing pack sizes\n- Conversion tracking shows consistent data across Google Ads and WooCommerce",

          "notes": "**EXPERIMENT CONTEXT:**\nThis is tracking the Chatsworth Escapes landing page A/B test that launched Nov 4, 2025. The conversion collapse coincided with the test start, affecting BOTH variants equally.\n\n**Performance Data:**\n- Nov 1-20: Only 1 conversion (\u00a3299 revenue, \u00a3330 spend, 91% ROAS)\n- Historical baseline: 0.43% CR\n- Current: 0.14% CR\n\n**Other Campaigns (Benchmarks):**\n\u2705 Bolton Abbey Self Catering: Converting normally (542% ROAS, 3 conversions)\n\u2705 All hotel campaigns: Converting normally (49+ conversions)\n\u274c Chatsworth showing lower conversion volume\n\n**A/B TEST STATUS:**\n- **Started:** Nov 4, 2025\n- **Ends:** Nov 30, 2025 (30-day test)\n- **Key Finding:** BOTH variants performing equally poorly (suggests issue isn't the landing page variants)\n- **Critical:** DO NOT kill test early - self-catering has long booking lead times (need full 30 days for conversion lag)\n\n**INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES:**\n\n1. **Availability Issues** (HIGH PRIORITY)\n   - EMAIL SENT: Gary contacted Nov 20 to check Chatsworth website/availability\n   - EXPECTED RESPONSE: Nov 21\n   - Question: Did Chatsworth properties go offline, sell out, or have pricing changes around Nov 4?\n\n2. **Technical Issues**\n   - Are there Chatsworth-specific site issues affecting both variants?\n   - Check booking flow, form submissions, payment processing\n\n3. **Seasonal Factors**\n   - Nov is traditionally slower for self-catering bookings\n   - Compare to Nov 2024 performance for Chatsworth\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\n\n**Immediate (Nov 21):**\n- Receive Gary's response on availability/website changes\n- If availability issue found: Pause campaign OR reduce budget until resolved\n\n**Ongoing (Nov 21-30):**\n- Continue monitoring BOTH A/B test variants\n- Do NOT make changes that invalidate the test\n- Track daily: impressions, clicks, CTR, bounce rate, conversion rate\n\n**Final Analysis (Dec 1):**\n- Compare full 30-day results for both landing page variants\n- Account for booking lead time lag (some Nov conversions may attribute in Dec)\n- Determine if conversion collapse was due to:\n  a) Availability/external factors (not test-related)\n  b) Landing page changes (both variants equally bad)\n  c) Seasonal drop (compare to 2024)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- If availability issue: Resolve and retest\n- If landing page issue: Revert to original page\n- If seasonal: Accept lower Nov performance, revisit Dec/Jan\n\n**Note:** This task combines investigation + experiment tracking since both are intertwined.",

This optimization approach uses:\n- Asset performance tracking\n- AI-powered replacement suggestions based on landing page content\n- Google Sheet approval workflow for client review\n- Data-driven approach to improve click-through rates and conversion performance\n\n**What to Do:**\n1. Review current RSA campaigns in Devonshire account\n2. Identify RSAs with poor-performing headlines/descriptions\n3. Extract current text assets from RSAs\n4. Generate replacement suggestions using same AI approach as PMax\n5. Create approval sheet for Helen to review\n6. Implement approved changes\n7. Monitor performance impact\n\n**Tools to Use:**\n- `.claude/skills/pmax-text-asset-optimizer/` - Adapt workflow for RSAs\n- `mcp__google-ads__replace_rsa_text_assets()` - Apply changes\n- Google Sheets for client approval workflow\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- RSA optimization process documented\n- Initial round of RSA improvements implemented\n- Performance tracking in place\n- Process repeatable for future optimization cycles\n\n**Timeline:** ~3 weeks (allows time for PMax optimization to fully roll out first)\n\n**Deferred to:** Mid-January 2026 (after PMax asset testing period concludes mid-January 2025)",

REVIEW DEC 12-14 PERFORMANCE:**\n- Verify strategic pauses working\n- Check remaining budget headroom\n- Calculate safe scaling amount\n\n**2. IDENTIFY SCALING CANDIDATES:**\n\n**Criteria:**\n- High ROAS (>600%) during Dec 12-14\n- Brand campaigns (highest intent)\n- UK/USA only (EUR stopped, ROW stopped)\n- Campaigns that were budget-constrained in Phase 2\n\n**Query:**\n```python\nmcp__google-ads__run_gaql(\n    customer_id='[UK or USA account]',\n    manager_id='2569949686',\n    query='''\n        SELECT\n            campaign.id,\n            campaign.name,\n            campaign.status,\n            metrics.cost_micros,\n            metrics.conversions_value,\n            metrics.impressions,\n            metrics.search_impression_share,\n            campaign_budget.amount_micros\n        FROM campaign\n        WHERE\n            segments.date >= '2025-12-12'\n            AND segments.date <= '2025-12-14'\n            AND campaign.status = 'ENABLED'\n            AND metrics.cost_micros > 0\n        ORDER BY metrics.conversions_value DESC\n    '''\n)\n```\n\n**Look for:**\n- Campaigns hitting budget limits (search impression share lost to budget)\n- Strong ROAS (>600%)\n- Consistent performance\n\n**3. CREATE SCALING PLAN:**\n\n**Target increases:**\n- UK: +40% on top 5-8 brand/high ROAS campaigns\n- USA: +40% on top 5-8 brand/high ROAS campaigns\n\n**Example:**\n- UK Brand exact currently \u00a3150/day \u2192 Increase to \u00a3210/day\n- USA Brand broad currently \u00a3100/day \u2192 Increase to \u00a3140/day\n\n**Total daily increase target: ~\u00a31,500-2,000/day**\n\n**4. CREATE BACKUP:**\nFile: `/clients/smythson/scripts/backup-dec15-last-order-week-scaling.txt`\n\n**5. APPLY BUDGET INCREASES:**\nUse `mcp__google-ads__update_campaign_budget()` for each campaign\n\n**6. MONITOR CLOSELY:**\n- Dec 15: Check 6pm performance\n- Dec 16-19: Daily morning + evening checks\n- Watch for overspend vs \u00a36,900/day target\n- Be ready to pause if exceeding budget\n\n**7. ALGORITHM WARNING:**\n- Smart Bidding may overspend 15-20% during high-opportunity days\n- Last Order Week = \"high-opportunity days\"\n- Monitor actual vs SET carefully\n- Have pause list ready if overspending\n\n**REVENUE EXPECTATION:**\n- Phase 3 spend: \u00a334,500\n- At 6.0x ROAS: \u00a3207k revenue\n- At 5.5x ROAS: \u00a3190k revenue (conservative)\n\n**REFERENCE:**\n- `/clients/smythson/reports/p9-budget-constraint-crisis.txt` (Phase 3 plan)\n- Dec 12-14 performance data\n",

          "notes": "**Strategic Evaluation: Brand Shopping Campaign Setup**\n\n**Context:** Nils Rooijmans email (Nov 19/20, 2025) outlined best practice for brand Shopping campaigns - specifically using LOW-priority campaigns with negative keyword lists, NOT high-priority brand campaigns.\n\n**Current Superspace Setup:**\n- Shopping Branded: \u00a34,500/day (largest Shopping campaign)\n- P Max Brand Excluded: \u00a32,700/day\n- Shopping Brand Excluded: \u00a32,200/day\n\n**Question:** Is \"Shopping Branded\" following Nils' recommended LOW-priority structure, or is it high/medium priority?\n\n---\n\n## Nils Rooijmans' Methodology (The RIGHT Way)\n\n**Setup:**\n1. Create LOW-priority Shopping campaign for brand searches\n2. Add products you want to show for branded searches\n3. Set HIGH manual CPC bids (or allow high CPCs) for maximum visibility\n4. Add brand terms to negative keyword list on ALL other non-brand Shopping campaigns\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- Products ONLY show for branded searches (no budget waste)\n- Tight control over CPCs, impression share, and products shown\n- No need to negate thousands of non-brand searches (avoids keyword limit issues)\n\n**Critical Requirements:**\n\u26a0\ufe0f All products in low-priority brand campaign MUST ALSO be in high/medium-priority non-brand campaigns\n\u26a0\ufe0f Non-brand campaigns must NEVER run out of budget before brand campaign (prevents leakage)\n\u26a0\ufe0f Same ad schedules, audience targeting, device targeting, location targeting across all campaigns\n\n---\n\n## Audit Action Items\n\n**Step 1: Check Current Campaign Priority (15 mins)**\n- Open \"Shopping Branded\" campaign in Google Ads\n- Check Campaign Settings \u2192 Shopping campaign priority\n- Current setting: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW?\n- Current bid strategy: Manual CPC or Smart Bidding?\n- Current bids: What are typical CPCs?\n\n**Step 2: Check Negative Keyword Lists (15 mins)**\n- Are brand terms (\"superspace\", \"getsuperspace\", etc.) added as negatives to:\n  - \"Shopping Brand Excluded\" campaign? \u2713 or \u2717\n  - \"P Max Brand Excluded\" campaign? (check if PMax respects negative lists)\n  - Other Shopping campaigns?\n- If YES: Already following part of best practice\n- If NO: Brand leakage risk across campaigns\n\n**Step 3: Check Product Coverage (15 mins)**\n- Are ALL products in \"Shopping Branded\" campaign ALSO in non-brand Shopping campaigns?\n- Could non-brand searches accidentally trigger brand campaign due to budget constraints?\n- Check budget pacing: Does \"Shopping Branded\" ever exhaust before others?\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Current Performance (10 mins)**\n- What % of \"Shopping Branded\" searches are actually branded vs non-branded?\n  - Run Search Terms Report for last 30 days\n  - Count branded searches vs generic searches\n- Are you paying for non-brand clicks in the brand campaign? (waste indicator)\n\n**Step 5: Document Findings & Recommendation (5 mins)**\n- Current structure: Follows Nils' best practice? Yes / No / Partial\n- If NO: What needs to change?\n- If YES: Document for knowledge base\n\n---\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n**If currently HIGH-priority brand campaign (wrong way):**\n- Recommendation: Switch to LOW-priority + high manual bids\n- Add \"superspace\" brand terms to negative lists on non-brand campaigns\n- Expected benefit: Tighter budget control, prevent non-brand waste\n\n**If already LOW-priority (right way):**\n- Document current setup as best practice example\n- Verify negative keyword lists are comprehensive\n- Monitor for any non-brand search leakage\n\n---\n\n## Reference Documents\n\n**Nils Rooijmans Email:** Saved in knowledge base (Nov 19/20, 2025)\n- Topic: \"How do you run BRAND campaigns in Shopping?\"\n- Key principle: LOW-priority campaign + negative keyword lists (not high-priority with script negation)\n\n**Related:** This same audit should be applied to Tree2MyDoor brand campaigns (separate task created)\n\n\n**Manual Note (2025-11-27):** Rescheduled to second week December - currently in Black Friday period, no capacity for Superspace strategic work.\n\n**Manual Note (2025-11-27):** Rescheduled to second week December - currently in Black Friday period, no capacity for Superspace strategic work.",
