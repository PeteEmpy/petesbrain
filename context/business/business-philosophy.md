# Business Philosophy & Values

## Core Values

1. **Automation Without Dehumanisation** - Use AI to scale, but maintain personal touch and owner access
2. **Context Is Currency** - Comprehensive client history and documentation drives better decisions
3. **Continuous Learning** - Every client interaction feeds into system improvements and knowledge base
4. **Owner Access Over Gatekeepers** - Direct access to 22+ years of expertise, not juniors or process bottlenecks

## The Self-Improving Agency

**Core Concept:**
Roksys operates as an AI-powered solo consultancy that improves with every client interaction. Rather than hiring staff, we use automation and AI to scale while maintaining the personal service and owner expertise that differentiates us from traditional agencies.

**How It Works:**
1. Every client interaction is documented in comprehensive CONTEXT.md files
2. Every decision and experiment is recorded in rok-experiments
3. Knowledge from each client is captured in 1,983+ article knowledge base
4. Proprietary tools (PetesBrain) become smarter with more client data
5. System learns, improves, and becomes more valuable

**Why It Matters:**
- Traditional agencies hire staff (cost, complexity, quality variance)
- Roksys scales through AI and documentation (cost-effective, consistent, improving)
- The system itself becomes a competitive moat and eventual sellable asset
- Owner stays personally involved in every client

## Foundational Operating Principles

### Principle 1: Batch-Driven Over Interruption-Driven

**Our Approach:**
- Email sync runs continuously (not real-time chat)
- Weekly performance reviews (not daily status meetings)
- Automated daily briefings (replacing manual checks)
- Scheduled agent workflows (not ad-hoc requests)

**Why This Works:**
- Batch processing is more efficient than real-time responses
- Allows deep focus on strategy and optimisation
- Reduces context-switching (kills productivity)
- Automation handles routine checks automatically

### Principle 2: Asynchronous Over Real-Time

**Our Approach:**
- Email is primary communication channel (not Slack or Teams)
- Automated reporting (not scheduled calls)
- Meeting notes auto-imported from Granola AI
- Documentation is the source of truth

**Why This Matters:**
- Asynchronous allows clients to fit communication into their schedule
- Reduces pressure for immediate response (24-48 hour response windows)
- Creates written record (better than verbal discussions)
- Scalable (one email to multiple recipients vs repeated calls)

### Principle 3: Documentation Over Memory

**Our Approach:**
- Every client has comprehensive CONTEXT.md (strategic context, metrics, preferences)
- Every client folder has complete email history (organised by date)
- Every experiment documented in rok-experiments spreadsheet
- Every decision captured in meeting notes

**Why It Matters:**
- Documentation is retrievable and searchable (memory is not)
- New team members (or AI assistants) understand context immediately
- Historical decisions inform future strategy
- Knowledge is not lost when people leave

## Value Creation Approach

**How We Deliver Value:**

1. **Daily Monitoring** - "Like it's our own business"
2. **Data-Driven Optimisation** - Based on evidence, not opinion
3. **Proactive Recommendations** - Not reactive support

## Product Development Philosophy

**Build Internal Tools First:**
- Identify problems in our own client work
- Build tools to solve them
- Test with our own clients
- Refine based on real usage
- Then consider external release

**Why This Approach:**
- We understand the problem deeply (we live it)
- Tools are battle-tested before sharing
- Features are prioritised by our real needs
- Quality is high (we use them daily)

## Decision-Making Framework

**How We Make Decisions:**

1. **Data-Informed, Experience-Guided** - Start with data, apply 22+ years of experience
2. **Test-And-Learn Approach** - Don't bet the farm on theories
3. **Document Everything** - Every decision captured in writing
4. **Long-Term Thinking** - Not quarterly results chasing
