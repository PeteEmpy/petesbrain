ROK SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES:
{rok_specs}

{kb_specs_text}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL QUALITY STANDARDS - THIS IS YOUR PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before you write a SINGLE word, you must:

1. Read EVERY piece of website content provided above
2. Internalize the brand's voice - how they speak, what words they choose
3. Understand their customers - who buys £200 leather notebooks?
4. Study their heritage and positioning - what makes them special?
5. Note specific product features, materials, craftsmanship details

THEN and ONLY THEN can you begin writing.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 1: DEEP BRAND ANALYSIS (This is not optional - do this thoroughly):

A) TONE OF VOICE ANALYSIS - Study how this brand communicates:
   - What is the formality level? (Professional/casual/friendly/authoritative)
   - What emotional tone do they use? (Warm/clinical/energetic/calm/playful)
   - What language style? (Simple/technical/poetic/direct/conversational)
   - Look at their actual word choices, sentence structure, personality
   - Are they serious or do they use humor? What kind?
   - Do they use questions, exclamations, or statements?
   - CRITICAL: Your ad copy MUST sound like it was written by the same person who wrote this website

B) TARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS - Who is actually buying this?
   - Demographics: Age range, gender, income level, location
   - Psychographics: What are their values, lifestyle, priorities?
   - Pain points: What problem are they trying to solve? What keeps them up at night?
   - Motivations: Why would they choose THIS product/service over competitors?
   - Language they use: How do THEY talk about their problem/need?
   - Decision triggers: What would make them click and buy NOW?
   - CRITICAL: Write as if you're talking directly to ONE specific person in this audience

C) BRAND POSITIONING:
   - What makes this brand different from competitors?
   - What's their unique value proposition?
   - What do they emphasize most on their website?
   - What customer benefits do they lead with?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 2: CRAFT 50 EXCEPTIONAL HEADLINES (10 per section)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
{context_reminder}
CHARACTER REQUIREMENTS - STRICTLY ENFORCED:
   ⚠ MAXIMUM: 30 characters (HARD LIMIT - Google will reject anything over 30)
   ⚠ TARGET: 27-30 characters (REQUIRED - anything under 25 chars will be rejected)
   ⚠ MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE: 25 characters (but aim for 27-30)

   🚨 CRITICAL: Headlines under 25 characters will be AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED 🚨

   Goal: Use the FULL 27-30 character space for maximum impact.
   Don't waste valuable ad space - every character counts!

CAPITALIZATION - MANDATORY (ROK Standard, Nov 2025):
   ✓ USE SENTENCE CASE for all headlines
   ✓ Capitalize ONLY the first word and proper nouns (brand names, place names)
   ✓ Keep all other words lowercase

   Examples:
   ✓ CORRECT: "Handcrafted leather diaries" (sentence case)
   ✓ CORRECT: "Shop Smythson Christmas gifts" (sentence case, brand name capitalized)
   ✗ WRONG: "Handcrafted Leather Diaries" (title case - do not use)
   ✗ WRONG: "HANDCRAFTED LEATHER DIARIES" (all caps - policy violation)

   Why: Research on 1M+ ads shows sentence case performs better on CTR, ROAS, and CPA
   because it looks more natural and resembles organic search results.

QUALITY STANDARDS - CRITICAL:
   ✓ MUST use ACTUAL product names, materials, and features from THIS SPECIFIC PAGE
   ✓ MUST reference REAL details from the website content above (not generic placeholders)
   ✓ Look at the H1, H2, H3 tags - use those EXACT product names and categories
   ✓ Look at the paragraphs - extract REAL features, materials, specifications
   ✓ If the page mentions specific sizes, colors, materials, prices, or offers - USE THEM
   ✓ Each headline must sound like it came from THIS brand's copywriters
   ✓ No generic phrases - every line should be unique to THIS page
   ✓ Match the sophistication level - luxury brands don't shout
   ✓ Include numbers, heritage dates, or specific benefits where relevant

REMINDER: These are EXAMPLES only - your headlines MUST be specific to the page you're analyzing!

GOOD HEADLINE STRUCTURE (but adapt to the actual page):
   - "[Specific Product Type] [Key Material/Feature]" (28-30 chars)
   - "[Actual Number/Date] [Real Product Category]" (28-30 chars)
   - "[Exact Brand Feature] | [Real Offer]" (28-30 chars)

BAD HEADLINES - NEVER DO THIS:
   - "Shop Now" (9) ✗ LAZY - not specific to the page!
   - "Quality Products" (17) ✗ GENERIC - could be any page!
   - "Buy Premium Goods Today" (23) ✗ VAGUE - no specific product details!

SECTIONS (10 headlines each):
   a) BENEFITS - What makes this irresistible to THEIR target customer
   b) TECHNICAL - Specific craftsmanship, materials, features from website
   c) QUIRKY - Clever, sophisticated wit (if brand allows) or elegant wordplay
   d) CTA - Compelling actions that match the brand's communication style
   e) BRAND - Heritage, positioning, what makes them uniquely them

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 3: WRITE 50 MASTERFUL DESCRIPTIONS (10 per section)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
{context_reminder}
CHARACTER REQUIREMENTS - STRICTLY ENFORCED:
   ⚠ MAXIMUM: 90 characters (HARD LIMIT - Google will reject anything over 90)
   ⚠ TARGET: 82-90 characters (REQUIRED - anything under 80 chars will be rejected)
   ⚠ MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE: 80 characters (but aim for 82-90)

CAPITALIZATION - MANDATORY (ROK Standard, Nov 2025):
   ✓ USE SENTENCE CASE for all descriptions
   ✓ Capitalize ONLY the first word and proper nouns (brand names, place names)
   ✓ Keep all other words lowercase

   Examples:
   ✓ CORRECT: "Explore our collection of handcrafted leather goods made in Britain since 1887"
   ✓ CORRECT: "Shop Smythson's Christmas collection online with free UK delivery available"
   ✗ WRONG: "Explore Our Collection Of Handcrafted Leather Goods" (title case - do not use)

   Why: Sentence case performs better on CTR, ROAS, and CPA for RSAs and asset groups.

   🚨 CRITICAL: Descriptions under 80 characters will be AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED 🚨

   Goal: Use the FULL 82-90 character space for compelling, complete sentences.
   This is your chance to persuade - don't waste a single character!

WRITING STYLE - CRITICAL:
   ✓ Write as ONE COMPLETE SENTENCE - this is essential for readability
   ✓ No choppy fragments, no multiple disconnected thoughts
   ✓ Each description should be a single, elegant, flowing sentence
   ✓ Use sophisticated language: "Discover...", "Experience...", "Crafted with..."
   ✓ One cohesive message from start to finish, using full 80-90 character space
   ✓ Match the brand's actual writing style from their website

GOOD DESCRIPTION STRUCTURE - SINGLE SENTENCE:
   Write ONE complete sentence that flows naturally from beginning to end.
   Structure: [Opening hook] + [supporting detail] + [benefit/CTA], all flowing together.

   Example structure: "Discover hand-stitched Italian leather bags with lifetime warranty."
   NOT: "Premium bags. Italian leather. Shop now." (too choppy!)

REMINDER: These are EXAMPLES only - your descriptions MUST use REAL details from THIS page!

GOOD DESCRIPTION STRUCTURE (but use actual page content):
   - Start with specific product category from the page (not "products" or "items")
   - Include actual materials, sizes, features mentioned on the page
   - Reference real offers, prices, or benefits shown on the page
   - Use the exact terminology the brand uses (check H1, H2, paragraphs)

BAD DESCRIPTIONS - NEVER DO THIS:
   - "Premium products. Shop now." ✗ Could apply to ANY page!
   - "Quality items. Great prices." ✗ No specific page details!
   - Generic descriptions that don't reference THIS specific page's content

   ✓ Mirror the website's exact tone of voice
   ✓ Use their specific terminology and product names
   ✓ Include real numbers, dates, or specifications from the website
   ✓ Address what THEIR customers actually care about

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINAL QUALITY CHECKLIST - Review before submitting:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
{context_reminder}
Before you return your JSON, verify:
   □ Have I fully incorporated ALL user-provided context into my copy?
   □ Do I have EXACTLY 50 headlines? (10 per section)
   □ Do I have EXACTLY 50 descriptions? (10 per section)
   □ Are 100% of headlines 25-30 characters? (anything under 25 WILL BE REJECTED)
   □ Are 100% of descriptions 80-90 characters? (anything under 80 WILL BE REJECTED)
   □ Is each description ONE complete sentence? (no choppy fragments!)
   □ Does each line maximize the available character space?
   □ Does each line sound like THIS brand wrote it?
   □ Have I used SPECIFIC REAL product names from THIS PAGE (not generic terms)?
   □ Have I referenced ACTUAL materials, features, or details from THIS PAGE?
   □ Can I point to where in the website content I found each detail?
   □ Are descriptions complete, flowing sentences?
   □ Would someone reading my ad know it's about THIS SPECIFIC page/product?
   □ Have I avoided all generic phrases that could apply to any page?
   □ Does this reflect 20+ years of copywriting mastery?

If you answer "no" to ANY of these, revise before submitting.

REMEMBER: Someone should be able to read your headlines/descriptions and say "this is clearly about [SPECIFIC PRODUCT/PAGE]", not just "this is about some product".

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - STRICTLY ENFORCED:

{context_section}
{website_content}

ROK SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES:
{rok_specs}

{kb_specs_text}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1: DEEPLY ANALYZE THE WEBSITE (same as before - tone, audience, positioning)

STEP 2: Generate HEADLINES & DESCRIPTIONS
{context_reminder}
⚠️ CHARACTER LIMITS ⚠️

SHORT HEADLINES (50 total - 10 per category):
- MAXIMUM: 30 characters (Google's hard limit)
- TARGET: 27-30 characters (STRICTLY ENFORCED - anything under 25 will be REJECTED)
- MINIMUM: 25 characters (REQUIRED)
- CAPITALIZATION: SENTENCE CASE ONLY (first word + proper nouns capitalized, rest lowercase)
- Focus: Punchy, impactful messages - use the full 27-30 chars
- Categories: Benefits (10), Technical (10), Quirky (10), CTA (10), Brand (10)
- Examples: ✓ "Handcrafted leather diaries" ✗ "Handcrafted Leather Diaries"

LONG HEADLINES (25 total - 5 per category):
- MAXIMUM: 90 characters (Google's hard limit)
- TARGET: 82-90 characters (STRICTLY ENFORCED - anything under 80 will be REJECTED)
- MINIMUM: 80 characters (REQUIRED)
- CAPITALIZATION: SENTENCE CASE ONLY (first word + proper nouns capitalized, rest lowercase)
- WRITING STYLE: ONE complete sentence for maximum readability
- Focus: More detailed, complete statements that expand on products/benefits
- Categories: Benefits (5), Technical (5), Quirky (5), CTA (5), Brand (5)
- Examples: ✓ "Discover handcrafted leather goods..." ✗ "Discover Handcrafted Leather Goods..."

DESCRIPTIONS (25 total - 5 per category):
- MAXIMUM: 90 characters (Google's hard limit)
- TARGET: 82-90 characters (STRICTLY ENFORCED - anything under 80 will be REJECTED)
- MINIMUM: 80 characters (REQUIRED)
- CAPITALIZATION: SENTENCE CASE ONLY (first word + proper nouns capitalized, rest lowercase)
- WRITING STYLE: ONE complete, flowing sentence for maximum readability
- Focus: Complete, flowing sentences with persuasive details - NO choppy fragments
- Categories: Benefits (5), Technical (5), Quirky (5), CTA (5), Brand (5)
- Examples: ✓ "Shop our collection..." ✗ "Shop Our Collection..."

🚨 CRITICAL: Use the FULL 80-90 character space and write as SINGLE SENTENCES for readability! 🚨

STEP 3: Generate SITELINKS (4-6 sitelinks)
{context_reminder}
For each sitelink generate:
- Headline: MAXIMUM 25 characters (SENTENCE CASE)
- Description line 1: MAXIMUM 35 characters (SENTENCE CASE)
- Description line 2: MAXIMUM 35 characters (SENTENCE CASE)
- Landing page URL: Must be relevant page on the website

Sitelinks should link to:
- Similar/related products
- Same category pages
- Key sections of the website
- Complementary offerings

STEP 4: Generate STRUCTURED SNIPPETS (3-5 snippet groups)

Format: Header + list of values
Common headers: "Brands", "Services", "Types", "Styles", "Models", "Amenities", "Courses", "Degrees", "Destinations", "Featured hotels", "Insurance coverage", "Neighborhoods", "Service catalog", "Shows", "Types"

Choose appropriate header(s) for this business and provide 3-10 values per header.

STEP 5: Generate CALLOUTS (8-10 callouts)

MAXIMUM 25 characters each (SENTENCE CASE).
Highlight key benefits, features, offers, USPs.

STEP 6: Generate SEARCH THEMES (50 search terms)

Create 50 search terms/phrases that:
- Cover all different ways visitors search for this product/service
- Include variations (singular/plural, formal/casual)
- Mix broad and specific terms
- Include brand and non-brand terms
- Match search intent for THIS specific page/product
- Use language the target audience actually uses

CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL ASSETS:
{context_reminder}
- Apply same tone-of-voice analysis as before
- Match brand's communication style precisely
- Write for the specific target audience
- Use actual content from website, not generic templates
- Maximize character limits where applicable
- Be specific, not generic
- No clichés
- Fully incorporate ALL user-provided context (if any)
