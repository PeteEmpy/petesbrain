Here's my strategic approach:\n\n**Asset Group Strategy**: Don't fall into the trap of cramming everything into one asset group. I'd segment by product categories or customer intent levels - separate asset groups for your premium services versus entry-level offerings. Each needs distinct messaging and creative angles.\n\n**Creative Hierarchy**: Lead with video assets that showcase real client transformations or behind-the-scenes expertise. Google's giving video assets priority in the auction, so skimping here is campaign suicide. Follow with high-quality images that aren't just stock photos - authentic shots of your team, workspace, or client interactions perform significantly better.\n\n**Audience Signal Intelligence**: Forget broad targeting. Feed Google your highest-value customer data through Customer Match, then layer in specific custom intent audiences based on competitor research and industry-specific search behaviours. The algorithm needs quality signals, not quantity.\n\n**Landing Page Optimisation**: Each asset group should drive to tailored landing pages that match the creative messaging. If your video talks about \"strategic thinking,\" your landing page better lead with strategic outcomes, not generic benefits.\n\n**Budget Allocation**: Start with 70% of budget on your best-performing product/service category, then scale horizontally once you've proven the concept works.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n- **Google's Performance Max Best Practices Guide** - Essential for understanding the latest algorithm updates and asset requirements\n- **\"Performance Max Asset Testing Framework\" by Frederick Vallaeys** - Brilliant methodology for systematic creative testing\n- **Google Ads Help: Customer Match Setup** - Critical for proper audience signal implementation\n\n## Follow-Up Questions\n\n- What's your current customer lifetime value by service type, and how does this inform our asset group segmentation?\n- Do you have video testimonials or case studies we can leverage, or do we need to create these from scratch?\n- What specific competitor activities or industry searches are your ideal clients likely performing before they're ready to buy?\n- How sophisticated is your current conversion tracking - can we properly attribute offline conversions back to P Max touchpoints?\n\n## Devil's Advocate\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: Performance Max campaigns often cannibalise your best-performing Search campaigns without you realising it. Google's \"incremental reach\" claims are largely bollocks - you're frequently just paying more for the same clicks through a black box you can't control. Before launching P Max, audit your existing Search performance ruthlessly. If you're already dominating your key terms with healthy ROAS, P Max might actually decrease your overall profitability whilst Google celebrates your \"expanded reach.\"",

      "content": "## Main Analysis\n\nRight, I need to level with you here - I can't actually access your Google Ads account or any current campaign data for Bright Minds. What I can do is walk you through my audit methodology so you can assess your setup like a strategist would.\n\n**Account Structure Audit**: First, screenshot your campaign structure. Are you running multiple campaign types that are competing against each other? The classic mistake I see is Search, Shopping, and Display campaigns all bidding on the same audiences with different attribution models - it's budget cannibalization disguised as diversification.\n\n**Performance Max Reality Check**: If you're already running P Max, check your asset group performance and audience insights. Most accounts I audit have P Max stealing budget from high-performing exact match Search campaigns whilst claiming \"incremental reach.\" The data usually tells a different story.\n\n**Search Campaign Foundation**: Before we even think about P Max expansion, your Search campaigns need to be bulletproof. If your exact match campaigns aren't dominating your core service terms with healthy ROAS, launching P Max is putting the cart before the horse.\n\n**Conversion Tracking Sophistication**: This is where most service-based businesses fall apart. Are you tracking actual business outcomes (consultation bookings, qualified leads) or just form submissions? P Max needs quality conversion data to optimise effectively.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n- **Google Ads Account Structure Guide** - Essential for understanding campaign hierarchy and avoiding internal competition\n- **\"The Conversion Tracking Audit Checklist\" by Brad Geddes** - Critical for service businesses to measure real business impact\n- **Google Analytics 4 Enhanced Conversions Setup** - Necessary for proper P Max optimisation data\n\n## Follow-Up Questions\n\n- Can you share screenshots of your current campaign structure and their performance over the last 30 days?\n- What conversion actions are you currently tracking, and how do they correlate to actual business revenue?\n- Are you running any existing Performance Max campaigns, and if so, what's their impression share overlap with your Search campaigns?\n- What's your current cost per qualified lead across different campaign types, and how are you defining \"qualified\"?\n\n## Devil's Advocate\n\nHere's the harsh reality: Most Google Ads accounts I audit are structured like digital marketing textbooks from 2018. Everyone's rushing to implement the latest campaign types (P Max, Responsive Search Ads, automated bidding) whilst ignoring fundamental issues like proper negative keyword management, audience exclusions, and conversion tracking accuracy. If your Search campaigns aren't consistently profitable with manual oversight, handing control to Google's black box algorithms is strategic suicide. Fix the basics before chasing the shiny objects.",
