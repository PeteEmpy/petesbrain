# Title Pattern to Client Mappings
#
# Use this file to manually map meeting title patterns to specific clients.
# This is useful for:
# - Common abbreviations (e.g., "NDA" → National Design Academy)
# - Generic meeting titles that need explicit mapping
# - Ambiguous cases where fuzzy matching produces wrong results
#
# Format:
#   "pattern": "client-folder-name"
#
# Patterns are case-insensitive and match if found anywhere in the title.
#

# Current mappings:
"NDA": "national-design-academy"
"NMA": "national-motorsports-academy"
"Grain Guard": "grain-guard"
"GoGlean": "go-glean"
"Glean": "go-glean"
"Gleanuk": "go-glean"
