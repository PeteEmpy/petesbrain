The summer citrus feed is ideal for any citrus tree variety and can be applied weekly from April to September. The high nitrogen fertiliser supports the growth of new, healthy green leaves and prevents the premature ripening of fruits to limit fruit drop throughout the summer season. Provide everything your citrus tree needs through autumn and winter with the winter citrus feed. Citrus trees can produce fragrant blossom year-round so it\u2019s important they get a steady supply of nutrients, even in the winter. Providing nourishment through the colder months will maintain balanced growth and help prevent leaf drop and discolouration. Apply on a monthly basis from October to March. * 1 x Summer Citrus Feed * 1 x Winter Citrus Feed * Apply summer feed weekly from April to September * Apply winter feed monthly from October to March * Mix 1 teaspoon of feed in 2.5L (4 pints) of water * Allow water to come to room temperature before watering.",

Native saplings happily withstand our cold weather and mostly look after themselves. Water and sunlight are all this gift needs to flourish and thrive. * Native Tree Sapling of your choice * \ufeffTree Saplings are deciduous and lose all leaves from October-April * Personalised engraved plaque - up to 80 characters * Choose a wedding greetings card when you place your order * Delivered with a wooden plinth (FSC assured) * Tree protector tube and stake * Delivered in a purpose-made gift box made in the UK.",

      "description": "Send a Nectarine Tree Gift to give someone a yearly juicy crop of Nectarines. This Nectarine tree is best suited to Southern gardens. The word Nectarine means \"Sweet as Nectar\" and these fruits are certainly that. A close relative of the peach but with a smooth skin the Nectarine is every bit as good. Nectarines are very low in calories but high in Vitamin A and Potassium. The fruit will store in a refrigerator which will slow down the ripening process. The red flushed skin of the Snow Queen Nectarine hides a creamy juicy flesh that is bursting with sweet flavour. It is probably the best variety of Nectarine for home growing although it does require a slightly warmer position than a peach would. The tree produces flowers in spring and the fruit is ready for picking from early August. * The Snow Queen Nectarine is a self pollinating tree * This Nectarine tree does require warmer conditions and so it is best suited for growing in a greenhouse * The Snow Queen Nectarine tree has received an Award of Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society * Tree supplied is pot grown and comes in a 10 Litre pot. Approximately 150cm (5ft.) in height.",

      "description": "The James Grieve Apple Tree is a self pollinating fruit tree that produces versatile yellow apples that are great for both cooking and eating. The dual-purpose apple is great for eating fresh, cooking and even for a tipple of homemade cider or apple juice. James Grieve apples can be picked early in the season while still fairly firm, this is around late August time. When the young fruit is used as a cooking apple holds its shape well and delivers a delicious but tangy, sharp flavour. As the apple matures it mellows and develops a soft texture, similar to a firm pear. The James Grieve variety is reliable, resistant and will produce a good crop year after year making it one of the most perfect and popular gifts to send for birthdays, anniversaries and many more occasions. The apple tree has been lovingly pot grown and nurtured and is ready to be planted as soon as it arrives. * The James Grieve Apple Tree has received an Award of Merit from RHS * It\u2019s a resilient variety that is good for growing in northern areas of Britain * A self pollinating tree, meaning they do not require pollination by bees * Mature James Grieve apples make lovely dessert apples * The young apples are great for cooking with their pleasantly acidic flavour * A heavy cropping apple tree * Tree supplied in a 10L pot, and approximately 150cm (5ft.) in height. * Ideal for gardens of all sizes. the apple tree will grow to around 3m/10ft (Rootstock Size - M26)",

Homegrown cooking apples are a pleasure to pick in autumn and leave lasting impressions for birthdays, anniversaries, and other celebrations. Mary Ann Brailsford is credited with planting the original Bramley Apple Tree in her Southwell Nottinghamshire garden 200 years ago in 1809. Soft, pale pink blossom appears in spring from which a bounty of apples grows. The hefty apples are ripe by October, with creamy-white flesh that has a sharp, acidic taste but can be cooked for a sweet flavour and smooth texture. People who love cooking adore our easy to grow Bramley Apple Trees. Our Bramley Apples are Malus domestica 'Bramley's Seedling' variety, grown in the UK on a dwarf M27 rootstock, making them suitable for small gardens. Our Apple Trees are handpicked and gift-wrapped with special care. * Deciduous apple tree (bare from Nov - Apr) * Arrives with a height of 1.5m and can grow to 2m (6.5ft) * Delivered in a 28cm (10L) pot * Grown on an M27 rootstock and can fit in small gardens * Thrives planted in full sun * Delivered gift-wrapped * Produces blossom in the spring and fruits in the autumn",

      "description": "Red Grape Vine Gift: Gift someone a piece of the countryside with our Red Grape Vine. This vibrant vine, delivered in a height of 30-80cm, depending on the season, is a perfect choice for both experienced gardeners and those starting their green journey. It's not just a gift, but an investment in deliciousness and visual appeal. Our Red Grape Vine thrives in a sunny and sheltered spot, ideally south-facing. In the summer, the leaves burst with healthy green foliage, transforming into a captivating spectacle of vibrant autumn colors. This deciduous climbing shrub produces abundant grapes in August, ready for immediate enjoyment. These succulent grapes can be eaten straight from the vine, their sweet flavour delighting any palate. But there's more to this vine's potential - use these grapes to craft delectable jams, flavorful chutneys, or even produce your own homemade wine! This delightful grape vine boasts a versatile nature, perfectly suitable for both large and small gardens. Choose to grow it directly in the ground or bring a touch of the outdoors in, nurturing it within a pot on a sunny balcony or patio. To help this vine reach its full potential, ensure you provide the necessary support with a trellis or sturdy wall, enabling it to climb with ease. You can confidently purchase the Red Grape Vine from Tree2mydoor, as each vine is carefully chosen from our nursery. Wrapped with care, it arrives in a rustic hessian bag nestled in our bespoke packaging. Delivered to your doorstep, it's ready to grace any recipient and fill their garden with abundance. For those residing in cooler northern regions, consider providing extra shelter from frost or offering the vine a protected haven within a greenhouse to ensure its vigorous growth. Our Red Grape Vine is more than just a gift, it's a window into the world of grape cultivation. Enjoy the rewarding process of tending to your very own grapevine and relish the fruits of your labor, literally!",

The Bay Leaves from our superb Small Bay Trees are excellent in Asian and Mediterranean cooking and would make a perfect gift for a foodie. The Bay Laurel is a small tree native to the shores of the Mediterranean but has been cultivated in Britain since the 16th century. It can be grown indoors in a pot, or outside on the patio and is the perfect gift for food lovers! Our potted Bay Laurel looks great on either side of the door, so why not buy two small bay trees for a stunning look! The Bay Laurel Tree is said to have both healing and protective properties, and it is thought that a Bay Tree growing near or in your garden will protect the house and ward off illness. When a new baby arrives it is lucky to celebrate by planting a Bay Tree. Bay trees will need protection during the winter months as strong, cold winds and frost can be damaging. * Native to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and cultivated in Britain since the 16th century * Grown for its aromatic and glossy foliage used in cooking * Versatile as a dense, pyramidal evergreen shrub or tree * Stands clipping well and is a favourite for Planters * Used in the Middle Ages to keep away evil and resist witchcraft * Small - 2.5L pot, 45-60cm height * Medium - 3L pot, 70-80cm height * Large - 5L pot, 80-90cm height",

      "description": "A deliciously golden apple tree gift to send for any occasion. The Golden Delicious apple tree provides one of our best loved fruits that are at their finest when eaten straight from the tree. The Golden Delicious apple tree originated from the USA and has now become the most widely grown apple in the world. The fruit is exactly what it says on the tin.. golden in colour and delicious in flavour. The Golden Delicious is at it's best when eaten straight from the tree and has a crispy texture and sugar sweet flavour. You will never find a Golden Delicious apple at it's sweetest in the supermarket as the flavour diminishes in storage. It is also a brilliant apple to cook with as its sweetness means you can cut down on the amount of sugar used in recipes. It also holds its shape well, making it perfect for pastries and pies. It is best suited to Southern areas of the UK and will require a full sun position in the garden. * The Golden Delicious Apple tree has received an award of merit from the RHS. * The tree does require a warmer climate and will do better in Southern gardens. * A heavy cropper that is disease resistant. * Golden Delicious apples are great desert and cooking apples. * Tree supplied in a 10 litre pot, and approximately 150cm (5ft.) in height. * The Golden Delicious apple tree supplied is on M27 root stock * Pollination Group 4. * Ideal for gardens of all sizes, the Golden Delicious apple tree will grow to around 3m/10ft",

      "description": "Give a new baby a warm welcome with our Welcome to the World Baby Gift. Nothing can quite match the feeling of watching a baby grow up alongside their very own tree. Every season and year brings natural beauty and sentimental value. One day, they\u2019ll be able to swing from its branches or lounge under them during warm summers. Whatever it is used for, it\u2019s certain this gift won\u2019t soon be forgotten. You can choose one of our native saplings! Each one has symbolism and natural beauty as intriguing as the last, so you are sure to find a fitting gift for a precious, new life. Don\u2019t have room to plant one of our native saplings? Not to worry. They can be planted in a large pot for 5 years before finding a spot to settle in; maybe the large back garden of your new family home, a hidden wooded area you can make your own, or even in a Grandparent\u2019s garden. Native Saplings comfortably grow in our terrible weather and shrug off the winter months ready for spring again. * Native tree sapling of your choice * Native saplings are deciduous so lose their leaves in October-April * Personalised engraved plaque - up to 80 characters * Choose a Welcome to the World greetings card when you place your order * Delivered with a wooden plinth (FSC assured) * Tree protector tube and stake * Delivered in a purpose-made gift box made in the UK.",

Our potted Bay Laurel looks great at either side of the door, so why not buy two!! Remember to protect your Bay in winter as cold winds and frost can be damaging. Tree delivered is approximately 70cm (28inches) in height. * Native to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and cultivated in Britain since the 16th century. * Grown for its aromatic and glossy foliage used in cooking. * Versatile as a dense, pyramidal evergreen shrub or tree. * Stands clipping well and is a favourite for Planters. * Used in the Middle Ages to keep away evil and resist witchcraft.",

      "description": "Your Mum is the ultimate love that you will share for the rest of your life. The gift that is given should encapsulate that perfectly, with the Crab Apple tree it will for a lifetime. The Crab Apple Tree Gift is a Tree of Love, to make special all the love that you and your mum share. With this My Mum Tree Gift Box she will not only get a Tree of Love but also the Flowers of Love with her very own love in a bag. The ideal time to give the My Mum Tree Gift Box is Mothers Day. Imagine giving a gift that she will be able to cherish always and forever, giving her a loving reminder that you will always be there. Your mum will always be able to look in the Garden and see her very own piece of you, growing beautifully just like she watched you grow. The Crab Apple Tree Gift is a baby that will arrive at around 30cm tall. This will allow your mum to watch it grow for many years to come. The Crab Apple gift is deciduous, just like most native UK Trees and will be just as beautiful in the winter as it will in the Summer.

      "description": "Give a new baby a warm welcome with our Welcome to the World Baby Gift. Nothing can quite match the feeling of watching a baby grow up alongside their very own tree. Every season and year brings natural beauty and sentimental value. One day, they\u2019ll be able to swing from its branches or lounge under them during warm summers. Whatever it is used for, it\u2019s certain this gift won\u2019t soon be forgotten. You can choose one of our native saplings! Each one has symbolism and natural beauty as intriguing as the last, so you are sure to find a fitting gift for a precious, new life. Don\u2019t have room to plant one of our native saplings?

Native Saplings comfortably grow in our terrible weather and shrug off the winter months ready for spring again. * Native tree sapling of your choice * Native saplings are deciduous so lose their leaves in October-April * Personalised engraved plaque - up to 80 characters * Choose a Welcome to the World greetings card when you place your order * Delivered with a wooden plinth (FSC assured) * Tree protector tube and stake * Delivered in a purpose-made gift box made in the UK.",

      "description": "Bay leaves are best known for their use in cooking and have a unique and fragrant flavour that compliments most stews and casseroles. The Bay Leaves from our superb Small Bay Trees are excellent in Asian and Mediterranean cooking and would make a perfect gift for a foodie. The Bay Laurel is a small tree native to the shores of the Mediterranean but has been cultivated in Britain since the 16th century. It can be grown indoors in a pot, or outside on the patio and is the perfect gift for food lovers! Our potted Bay Laurel looks great on either side of the door, so why not buy two small bay trees for a stunning look! The Bay Laurel Tree is said to have both healing and protective properties, and it is thought that a Bay Tree growing near or in your garden will protect the house and ward off illness. When a new baby arrives it is lucky to celebrate by planting a Bay Tree. Bay trees will need protection during the winter months as strong, cold winds and frost can be damaging. * Native to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and cultivated in Britain since the 16th century * Grown for its aromatic and glossy foliage used in cooking * Versatile as a dense, pyramidal evergreen shrub or tree * Stands clipping well and is a favourite for Planters * Used in the Middle Ages to keep away evil and resist witchcraft * Small - 2.5L pot, 45-60cm height * Medium - 3L pot, 70-80cm height * Large - 5L pot, 80-90cm height",

      "description": "Bay leaves are best known for their use in cooking and have a unique and fragrant flavour that compliments most stews and casseroles. The Bay Leaves from our superb Small Bay Trees are excellent in Asian and Mediterranean cooking and would make a perfect gift for a foodie. The Bay Laurel is a small tree native to the shores of the Mediterranean but has been cultivated in Britain since the 16th century. It can be grown indoors in a pot, or outside on the patio and is the perfect gift for food lovers! Our potted Bay Laurel looks great on either side of the door, so why not buy two small bay trees for a stunning look! The Bay Laurel Tree is said to have both healing and protective properties, and it is thought that a Bay Tree growing near or in your garden will protect the house and ward off illness. When a new baby arrives it is lucky to celebrate by planting a Bay Tree. Bay trees will need protection during the winter months as strong, cold winds and frost can be damaging. * Native to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and cultivated in Britain since the 16th century * Grown for its aromatic and glossy foliage used in cooking * Versatile as a dense, pyramidal evergreen shrub or tree * Stands clipping well and is a favourite for Planters * Used in the Middle Ages to keep away evil and resist witchcraft * Small - 2.5L pot, 45-60cm height * Medium - 3L pot, 70-80cm height * Large - 5L pot, 80-90cm height",

There is something special about the smell of roast chestnuts and this Regal sweet chestnut tree certainly gives a gift of the wow factor. One of the smaller sweet chestnut trees, the Regal is suitable for a larger garden and is virtually maintenance free. It is a good heavy cropper although it does tend to do better in a sunny spot in the garden and is more suited to the south of the UK. Harvest the nuts once they have fallen onto the ground, remove the prickly outer case and you will find smooth brown chestnuts all ready for roasting or making into a good old stuffing. * Regal sweet chestnut is perfect for a larger garden. * Tree supplied is approximately 2 years old and will fruit next season. * Nuts fall ready for harvesting in October. * Regal chestnut has shiny dark green leaves and produces a sweet smelling blossom in mid-summer. * Tree is supplied in a 10L lightweight non-decorative pot. * Tree is delivered at a height of approximately 1.5m (5ft).",

      "description": "The ethereal Wisteria is a truly wonderful gift. Favoured for its beautiful blue and violet blooms, this tree has become famous as a symbol of love, fertility and long life, making it a popular gift for anniversaries and weddings in particular. Our variety is the \u2018Golden King\u2019 Wisteria, meaning that it is a fast-growing climber that would be most at home growing against a wall, trellis or even a pergola. Hardy and deciduous by nature, you can expect this Wisteria to bloom in Spring and Summer, producing a lovely sweet fragrance. This gift is a real favourite with the bees, bugs, butterflies and birds, so it can be a great gift for bringing life to a garden. The Blue Wisteria prefers a full sun or part-shade area of the garden in moist, but well-drained soil. They aren\u2019t drought resistant though, so they do enjoy a good watering in dry periods, especially in sandy soils. To finish off your gift, add a personalised card at the checkout. * Wisteria brachybotris \u2018Golden King\u2019 * Arrives at a height of 140-160cm in a 3L pot * Produces full, blue blooms in the Spring and Summer * Deciduous shrub * Hardy, but does need extra protection from drought and frost * Should be pruned twice per year, in Jan-Feb and Jul-Aug * Ideal gift for birthdays, weddings and anniversaries.",

The Valentines Heart Rose bush produces a pale pink romantic rose that will melt your Valentines heart throughout the summer months. Pale pink roses are said to symbolise love and are associated with romance and admiration.

Please note all our roses are grown naturally, and are dispatched in the natural growing state for that time of the year. Therefore winter and early spring dispatches are unlikely to be in flower and are sometimes without foliage. * The Valentines Heart rose is a Florubunda rose and is hardy and tolerant. * Perfect for container or garden growing. * Position in full sun. * Suits most soils. * Plant is dispatched at a height of 30-70cm depending on the time of year. * Highly frangranced rose. * Can grow to a height of 1m (3ft).",

      "title": "Wollemi Pine Tree Gift",
      "description": "Our Wollemi Pine Tree is distinct in both appearance and history, making this a gift that stands out. This Jurassic-aged tree was discovered in Australia in 1994 with the species critically endangered. The Wollemi Pine Tree has dark, bumpy bark and exquisite, needle leaves. During the colder months, the Wollemi Pine becomes dormant and the buds take on a striking appearance - a white, waxy coating with ruby-coloured edges. In spring, the coating disappears and new growth bursts through. Wollemi Pines are naturally multi-stemmed but our nurseries prune them to a single stem to give an overall uniform shape. After some years, the Wollemi Pine produces long or round cones depending on whether it is male or female respectively. By planting just one Wollemi Pine, you can offset 2% of our carbon footprint and help preserve the species.

In Celtic mythology, this evergreen conifer is a symbol of fertility and is known as the \u2018Sweetest of the Woods\u2019. Customers tell us it is a joy to give for Christmas, christenings, and new baby celebrations. Our Scots Pine Sapling is a young tree that has exquisite, blue-green needle leaves that are slightly twisted and grow in pairs. Whatever the season, this tree keeps its rich colour. As the tree matures, its bark becomes scaly and grey-brown and flowers begin to grow - clusters of yellow anthers at the base of the shoots and red flowers that grow at the tips. After pollination by the wind, the red flowers transform into cones, inviting life in all its furry and feathered forms. The Scots Pine, Pinus sylvestris scotia, is native to the British Isles and the national tree of Scotland, but loved ones can admire this proud tree in their garden for years to come. Get yours in time for Christmas! Simply click \u2018Add to Basket\u2019 to choose a personalised card and a day for delivery. Our expert gardeners will handpick and beautifully gift-wrap your Scots Pine. * Evergreen native tree (leaves all year round) * Arrives with a height of 20-40cm and can grow to a height of 36m (118ft) * Can grow in a large pot for 3 years before being planted in a large garden * The national tree of Scotland * Thrives in full sun and is fully hardy * Delivered gift-wrapped in a hessian bag * A popular gift for Christmas, christenings, and new baby celebrations",

      "description": "Send our Rowan Tree Gift to a loved one and their garden will proudly show a growing reminder of your love. Rowans are revered as the \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 in Celtic mythology and are said to protect the home in which it grows. Wish friends and family well at housewarmings, weddings, or memorials in a way that will be remembered. This gift begins as a humble Rowan Tree Sapling with a slender trunk and light green leaves. Spring welcomes buds and creamy-white flowers that release enticing fragrances and invite butterflies, birds, and bees. Of course, the leaves in autumn aren\u2019t short of red and orange colour. As for the delicious berries, the female Rowans start to produce them after 7 years of growth. Rest assured, they are worth the wait. Picking ripe rowan berries in autumn for jam and jelly-making is simple yet satisfying. Our Rowan Sapling is native to the British Isles, fully hardy, and will happily grow in a large pot for 8 years before being planted. Click \u2018Add to Basket\u2019 to personalise a card then choose a day for delivery. * Deciduous native tree (no leaves between Nov - April) * Arrives with a height of 20-60cm and can grow to a height of 9m (30ft) * Can grow in a large pot for 8 years before being planted in a medium-sized garden * Thrives in full sun and is fully hardy * Delivered gift-wrapped * A popular gift for housewarmings, weddings, and memorials",

      "description": "Send a lovely Queen Cox Apple Tree to someone special who loves munching apples! A much loved garden fruit tree that produces a fine crop of mouth watering apples with an exceptional flavour. Not only are they great for eating fresh the fruit is amazing for juicing and making homemade cider! The apples are a stunning vibrant red colour and deliver a crisp aromatic flavour, they\u2019re best when eaten early in the season as they do not store as well as other varieties. Queen Cox trees are sensitive to cold and wet conditions, so the tree is better suited to Southern Areas of the UK which are a little warmer and drier than northern areas - bit of a softy really! The apples will be ripe around mid September proving it to be an extremely popular gift for Autumn occasions, especially birthdays. What\u2019s a better birthday treat than having deliciously ripe Queen Cox apples to pick year after year? * Queen Cox Apple Trees are self pollinating, and don\u2019t require pollination by bees * Recommended for southern gardens of England and Wales as they flourish in drier soils and conditions * The Queen Cox is a heavy cropper and a popular dessert apple * The tree supplied comes in a 10L pot * Delivered approximately 150cm (5ft.) in height * Perfect for any size garden the tree will grow to around 4m (13ft) in height (Rootstock Size - M26)",

The neat, grey-green leaves sit atop the long slender trunks and are perfect for adding a warm Mediterranean feel to gardens, patios, and perfect for framing doorways, entrances or stairways. Our pair of olive trees in pots are a pleasure for the senses; they have evergreen leaves year-round, small cream blossoms in the spring and with lots of hot, sunny weather the trees may produce some small olive fruits that will ripen in autumn. Olive trees are low maintenance and slow-growing, ideal for small gardens and busy gardeners. Although olive trees thrive in the Mediterranean they also flourish in the UK and will thrive in a sunny location with free-draining soil. When you order a pair of medium-sized olive trees, two matching trees are selected by our expert gardeners, beautifully gift-wrapped, and delivered via our premium courier service. * Evergreen olive trees (leaves all year round) * Pair of standard olive trees * Thrive in sunny spots and in a south-facing position * Native to Mediterranean areas and drought-tolerant * Suitable for potted and planted growth * Plant in free-draining potting mix * Olive fruits ripen in autumn (weather dependent) * A small pair of olive trees arrive in a 2L pot at a 50cm height (Mini Standard) * Medium pair of olive trees arrive in a 3L pot at a 60-70cm height * Large pair of olive trees arrive in a 5L pot at a 70-80cm height",

      "description": "Send our Rowan Tree Gift to a loved one and their garden will proudly show a growing reminder of your love. Rowans are revered as the \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 in Celtic mythology and are said to protect the home in which it grows. Wish friends and family well at housewarmings, weddings, or memorials in a way that will be remembered. This gift begins as a humble Rowan Tree Sapling with a slender trunk and light green leaves. Spring welcomes buds and creamy-white flowers that release enticing fragrances and invite butterflies, birds, and bees. Of course, the leaves in autumn aren\u2019t short of red and orange colour. As for the delicious berries, the female Rowans start to produce them after 7 years of growth. Rest assured, they are worth the wait. Picking ripe rowan berries in autumn for jam and jelly-making is simple yet satisfying. Our Rowan Sapling is native to the British Isles, fully hardy, and will happily grow in a large pot for 8 years before being planted. Click \u2018Add to Basket\u2019 to personalise a card then choose a day for delivery. * Deciduous native tree (no leaves between Nov - April) * Arrives with a height of 20-60cm and can grow to a height of 9m (30ft) * Can grow in a large pot for 8 years before being planted in a medium-sized garden * Thrives in full sun and is fully hardy * Delivered gift-wrapped * A popular gift for housewarmings, weddings, and memorials",

      "description": "A springtime showstopper, the perfect gift to celebrate new beginnings, birthdays and love. The Tulip Magnolia Tree is a unique beauty, ideal for medium to large-sized gardens. With its soft pink, goblet-shaped flowers emerging as early as February, this elegant deciduous shrub offers an unusually early display of spring colour (long before most other trees are even waking up). By March and April, its pink-purple magnolia blossoms are in full bloom, standing proud on slender branches just ahead of the lush, dark green leaves. It\u2019s a living gift that quietly says \"I'm thinking of you\" in the most meaningful way. Whether for a spring birthday, Mother\u2019s Day, anniversary or simply a well-earned congratulations. Because the blooms arrive so early, we suggest a little protection from late winter frost will help them thrive. Placed in a sunny, sheltered spot, this tree will grow with grace and become a lasting feature in the garden. Why they\u2019ll love it: * A beautiful symbol of new beginnings and enduring love * Blooms early \u2013 for when the world still feels grey and we need a little hope * Makes a memorable spring gift that grows more beautiful every year * A perfect choice for people who appreciate elegance, thoughtfulness and nature. Tulip Magnolia botanical details: * Variety: Tulip Magnolia (Magnolia x soulangeana) * Delivered gift-wrapped in a 3L pot, approx. 30\u201350cm tall * A multi-stem shrub or small tree, reaching up to 4m in height * Pink, tulip-shaped blossom appears from February onwards * Protect early blooms from spring frost for best results * A deciduous shrub \u2013 bare in winter, but full of promise.",

      "description": "Our Cinderella Dwarf Cherry Tree Gift certainly deserves its fairytale name. Its changing seasonal splendour and Japanese symbolism of life, beauty, and rebirth makes this an exceptional gift for weddings, anniversaries, and memorials. Early spring invites an enchanting display as pale pink flowers burst to life. Over the space of a few weeks, the blossom falls in a confetti-like display leaving the lush, green leaves behind. The leaves turn orange in autumn for another vibrant display. Our Cinderella Cherry Tree is perfect for spring weddings and anniversaries or for showing a loved one they are a princess. The tree is self-fertile and produces delicious eating cherries from late July onwards. This mini cherry tree has a compact, bushy growth habit and can fit in small gardens with ease, it\u2019s even better for patios. Our trees are beautifully gift-wrapped to leave lasting impressions. * Deciduous cherry tree (no leaves from Nov - Apr) * Delivered in a 30cm (10L) pot * Can grow to a height of 2m (6.5ft), ideal for small gardens * Can be planted or potted and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil * Pink blossoms appear in spring and leaves turn orange in autumn * Delicious edible cherries ripen from late July * Voted best new plant at the HTA show 2014 * Perfect for spring weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays",

      "description": "Send a gorgeous Pair of Olive Trees as a unique gift for a special occasion. The neat, grey-green leaves sit atop the long slender trunks and are perfect for adding a warm Mediterranean feel to gardens, patios, and perfect for framing doorways, entrances or stairways. Our pair of olive trees in pots are a pleasure for the senses; they have evergreen leaves year-round, small cream blossoms in the spring and with lots of hot, sunny weather the trees may produce some small olive fruits that will ripen in autumn. Olive trees are low maintenance and slow-growing, ideal for small gardens and busy gardeners. Although olive trees thrive in the Mediterranean they also flourish in the UK and will thrive in a sunny location with free-draining soil. When you order a pair of medium-sized olive trees, two matching trees are selected by our expert gardeners, beautifully gift-wrapped, and delivered via our premium courier service. * Evergreen olive trees (leaves all year round) * Pair of standard olive trees * Thrive in sunny spots and in a south-facing position * Native to Mediterranean areas and drought-tolerant * Suitable for potted and planted growth * Plant in free-draining potting mix * Olive fruits ripen in autumn (weather dependent) * A small pair of olive trees arrive in a 2L pot at a 50cm height (Mini Standard) * Medium pair of olive trees arrive in a 3L pot at a 60-70cm height * Large pair of olive trees arrive in a 5L pot at a 70-80cm height",

The Common Alder is a hardy tree that thrives in wet conditions and is a common inhabitant of riverbanks and areas with high rainfall. Its resistance of rot made its wood perfect for making bridges, boats and even clogs. It was also thought that putting an Alder leaf in shoes before starting a long journey would cool ones feet and prevent swelling and blisters along the way. Tree supplied is 20-40cm tall. * Common Alder Trees will grow to around 70ft (22m). * The Common Alder thrives in moist to wet ground it is a common inhabitant of riverbanks, low lying areas or upland areas with high rainfall. * Alder leaves are slow to decay if they fall into water and as such the trees should not be planted too close to riverbanks. * Nodules on roots which contain bacteria that fix nitrogen make it a valuable species for enriching poor ground.",

This Celtic symbol of strength, courage, and wisdom is revered as the \u2018Father of the Woods\u2019, the perfect sentiments for the occasion. This living gift arrives as a charming sapling with plans to mature into a mighty oak. It has lush green leaves throughout spring and summer, then autumn turns them fiery oranges and browns before falling off for winter.

Those celebrating a Silver Wedding Anniversary are lucky on two accounts, not only have they spent 25 years with the one they love. They also have a very beautiful rose dedicated to their special occasion. The Silver Anniversary Rose is a beautiful elegant rose of pure white, the large blooms appear in July and will flower continuously until September. The contrast of the white flowers against the green foliage is quite often breathtaking. The stems are long and slender making the Silver Anniversary Rose, a perfect flower for cutting. A display of the white flowers will look amazing in a glass vase as a table centrepiece. Please note all our roses are grown naturally and are dispatched in the natural growing state for that time of the year. Therefore winter and early spring dispatches are unlikely to be in flower and are sometimes without foliage. * Rose bushes arrive cut back between mid-September and April each year. Expect blooms between June and early September (weather permitting) * The Silver Anniversary rose is a Floribunda rose and has a strong healthy growth * Suitable for container and garden growing * Position in full sun and plant in well-drained, moist, fertile soil * Plant dispatched is 30cm-60cm depending on the time of year * Delivered in a 3.5L pot * Pure white flowers with a light green glossy foliage * Wonderful Scent * Requires a little more tending than other roses but is worth the extra work * Variety.

      "description": "Our Hawthorn Tree Gift has dense, green leaves and fragrant, white blossom in spring. As a symbol of love, protection, and marriage in Celtic mythology, our Hawthorn sapling is a superb wedding or anniversary gift. The Ancient Celts often referred to the Hawthorn as the \u2018Marriage Tree\u2019. It was once thought that any site which grows Hawthorn and Blackthorn Trees () is enchanted. Clusters of fragrant, white blossom burst through in May, giving the nickname the Maythorn Tree. This is followed soon after by bountiful bunches of dark red berries ready to be picked in autumn. Hawthorn berries can be used to make wine or jam, making this a great culinary gift for occasions in autumn. Hawthorn saplings become great hedge plants and are native to Britain. When you order our Hawthorn Tree, one is handpicked from our nursery and beautifully gift-wrapped in a hessian bag. * Small deciduous native tree (bare Nov - Apr) * Delivered gift-wrapped * Arrives with a height of 20-40cm and can grow to 14m (46ft) * Hawthorn berries ripe by autumn and can be used for tea or cooking * Hawthorn hedges are dense and a safe nesting place for birds * Celtic symbol of love, protection, and marriage",

The neat, grey-green leaves sit atop the long slender trunks and are perfect for adding a warm Mediterranean feel to gardens, patios, and perfect for framing doorways, entrances or stairways. Our pair of olive trees in pots are a pleasure for the senses; they have evergreen leaves year-round, small cream blossoms in the spring and with lots of hot, sunny weather the trees may produce some small olive fruits that will ripen in autumn. Olive trees are low maintenance and slow-growing, ideal for small gardens and busy gardeners. Although olive trees thrive in the Mediterranean they also flourish in the UK and will thrive in a sunny location with free-draining soil. When you order a pair of medium-sized olive trees, two matching trees are selected by our expert gardeners, beautifully gift-wrapped, and delivered via our premium courier service. * Evergreen olive trees (leaves all year round) * Pair of standard olive trees * Thrive in sunny spots and in a south-facing position * Native to Mediterranean areas and drought-tolerant * Suitable for potted and planted growth * Plant in free-draining potting mix * Olive fruits ripen in autumn (weather dependent) * A small pair of olive trees arrive in a 2L pot at a 50cm height (Mini Standard) * Medium pair of olive trees arrive in a 3L pot at a 60-70cm height * Large pair of olive trees arrive in a 5L pot at a 70-80cm height",

Known for its distinctive shape, the Ficus Ginseng tree is a beautiful evergreen bonsai. It is known to symbolise good health and long life which makes it a very thoughtful early birthday, christening or anniversary gift for a loved one. This variety of bonsai grows dark green, oval-shaped leaves, but they are most famously recognised for their stripey, reddish trunks. As Ficus Ginseng trees are particularly adaptable, they can be kept both indoors and outdoors, although it is best to keep them in a spot that has access to plenty of sunlight and away from anywhere too cold. Make occasions extra special and give a Ficus Ginseng tree to a loved one. When you order, a tree is handpicked by our devoted gardeners and beautifully gift-wrapped for fast delivery. * Evergreen Bonsai Tree (leaves all year round) * Delivered in a gift-wrapped pot * Arrives at a height of 50cm * Suitable for indoor growth in the UK, can be placed outdoors on warm, sunny days Ideal gift for birthdays, anniversaries and christenings.",

The Susan Magnolia Tree is a truly luscious addition to any garden in April... compact and bushy, with a slender trunk and branches adorned in deep purple-pink flowers that burst to life in early spring in April. Its graceful form and dramatic colour bring elegance to even the smallest outdoor spaces.

Blooms arrive in late March or early April, just in time for Mother\u2019s Day, milestone birthdays, spring weddings, or simply to say 'thinking of you'. And yes! It also makes a charming and playful gift for a special someone actually called 'Susan' ...and anyone who isn\u2019t. Because humour and heart make a powerful duo. Susan Magnolia botanical details: * Variety: Magnolia \u2018Susan\u2019 * Delivered: 50cm tall (incl. 21cm pot), gift wrapped and ready to impress * Expected height: Up to 4m (approx. 13ft) at maturity * Care: Loves a sunny, sheltered spot with well-drained soil * Flowering time: Early blossom appears in spring; from late March.

      "description": "Our Blue Blossom Ceanothus is a beautiful flowering shrub that is a wonderful gift choice for people who would like to add a splash of colour to their gardens. Brighten-up any outdoor space with a burst of vibrant blue in the summer months, ideal for anniversaries, birthdays and even weddings. This hardy, evergreen bush produces dark green foliage all year-round, but it is during the spring/summer months that this shrub comes into its own. In Spring the blue blooms burst into life taking over the entire shrub, making it a really lovely addition to garden borders as it is a low-growing shrub. This shrub is a big favourite for the bugs, bees and butterflies too, making it a really beautiful gift. The Blue Blossom Ceanothus enjoys a full sun location in the garden, preferably with well-drained soil. They are drought resistant, but do need the occasional water to stay completely happy and healthy. To complete the gift, add a personalised card at the checkout and we will handle the rest! * Ceanothus Thyrsiflorus Var. Repens * Arrives at a height of 20-30cm in a 2L pot * Produces blue flowers in Spring/Summer, maintains green foliage throughout the year * Hardy, prefers full sun position in well drained soil * Protect from hard frost * Prune after plant has finished flowering, removing any dead or damaged shoots * Ideal gift for summer birthdays, anniversaries and weddings",

Every season and year brings natural beauty and sentimental value. One day, they\u2019ll be able to swing from its branches or lounge under them during warm summers. Whatever it is used for, it\u2019s certain this gift won\u2019t soon be forgotten. You can choose one of our native saplings! Each one has symbolism and natural beauty as intriguing as the last, so you are sure to find a fitting gift for a precious, new life. Don\u2019t have room to plant one of our native saplings? Not to worry. They can be planted in a large pot for 5 years before finding a spot to settle in; maybe the large back garden of your new family home, a hidden wooded area you can make your own, or even in a Grandparent\u2019s garden. Native Saplings comfortably grow in our terrible weather and shrug off the winter months ready for spring again. * Native tree sapling of your choice * Native saplings are deciduous so lose their leaves in October-April * Personalised engraved plaque - up to 80 characters * Choose a Welcome to the World greetings card when you place your order * Delivered with a wooden plinth (FSC assured) * Tree protector tube and stake * Delivered in a purpose-made gift box made in the UK.",

Our Pomegranate Tree Gift will brighten up birthdays and celebrations with a beautiful crop of bright red pomegranates, year after year.

Our Pomegranate trees are a delightful addition to gardens and outdoor spaces, just keep them in a sunny, but sheltered area. The tree is a self-fertilising variety and will produce red flowers that turn into fruit in spring and summer.

Golden Memories rose bush produces clusters of golden and yellow flowers which bring a little sunshine to the garden throughout the summer. Yellow roses are said to represent joy, happiness and friendship and are a symbol of true love and domestic bliss. Our Golden Memories rose makes a special Golden Wedding Anniversary gift and the bees love them too! Please note all our roses are grown naturally, and are dispatched in the natural growing state for that time of the year. Therefore winter and early spring dispatches are unlikely to be in flower and are sometimes without foliage. * Golden Memories rose is a Floribunda rose and is hardy & resistant. * Will benefit from a sunny spot in the garden. * Prefers moist, fertile, well drained soil. * Perfect for large beds. * Can grow up to 1m (3ft). * Plant is dispatched at a height of 30-70cm depending on the time of year. * Golden Memories rose is slighly scented.",

      "description": "Plant our Friendship Willow Hedging Pack of 10, water it, watch it grow, and in as little as 6 weeks the willow will grow a beautiful topiary crown. This is the perfect tree to plant in rows to form standard-stemmed decorative hedging. Every year in early spring expect fresh new foliage growth. The decorative willow stem is handwoven from 9 living whips of willow to create a visually stunning feature which remains fixed in height, and over the first few seasons, they graft together into a single trunk, retaining its stunning woven effect.

      "description": "Small Fig Tree Gift - Send a small fig tree gift and let them make their very own Fig Rolls! This fig tree is not just a beautiful addition to any garden but a source of delicious and healthy fruit. The tree is hardy, thriving in the British climate and growing to a manageable size of around 3 meters (10 feet). You can expect your fig tree to arrive at around 40-70cm in height, depending on the time of year, and delivered in a 4-litre pot. This deciduous tree loses its leaves from October to March and then bursts back to life in the spring, producing gorgeous fruits from July to August. Figs are one of the first plants cultivated by humans, boasting a history mentioned in both the Bible and the Qur'an. These sweet, fleshy fruits are actually the flowers of the tree and have a unique appeal. They are highly versatile for both sweet and savory dishes and can be enjoyed straight off the tree or incorporated into delicious fig rolls. They also happen to be one of the highest plant sources of calcium and fiber. The large, decorative leaves of the fig tree add another dimension of beauty to your garden, creating a lush and welcoming atmosphere. To ensure your fig tree flourishes, it's important to protect the ends of the branches during the winter, as they carry the next year's crop. Using fleece for protection until after the last frost is recommended. As a bonus, the hardy nature of the fig tree makes it a reliable choice for any gardener, regardless of their experience level. So, gift a small fig tree, and let them experience the joy of growing their own sweet treats.",
