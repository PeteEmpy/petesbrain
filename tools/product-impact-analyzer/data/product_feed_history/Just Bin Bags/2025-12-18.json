      "description": "Red soluble strip laundry bags (http://justbinbags.co.uk/product/red-soluble-strip-laundry-bag-38-length/) | manufactured to: 18 x 27.5 x 37.5 inches - 450x700x950mm Due to H&S legislation Nursing Homes and Hospitals staff can not come into contact with soiled bedding. Therefore by filling the Red soluble strip laundry sacks with bedding and then loading this directly into the washing machine helps to avoid this contact. The strip of this bag dissolves in the washing machine. Only leaving the excess bag left. Simply throw the open bag away. The sheets held inside will fall out of the dissolving bag washing them in the machine. we have DIFFERENT COLOURS AVAILABLE in green and clear. We also stock different sizes. - PLEASE CONTACT US (http://justbinbags.co.uk/contact-us/) FOR DETAILS!",
