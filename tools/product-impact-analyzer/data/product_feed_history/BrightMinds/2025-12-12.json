The smaller archways provide a restricted height making a safe area for smaller birds to feed. This space limitation prevents access by larger species such as crows, pigeons, magpies, and seagulls from the food.",

This kit also has a fabulous 48 page colour booklet.\n\n Electric motors and generators are in countless devices, appliances, and vehicles we use every day. They are an essential technology in our modern world. With this kit, you can conduct 25 experiments to learn how an electric motor converts electricity into motion, and how an electric generator does just the opposite, converting motion into electricity.\n\nThe electric motor is made of transparent plastic to show how the inside components work. Set up the motor to run on battery power and learn how a motor works. Then reconfigure the device to work in reverse as a hand-crank electric generator. \n\n Experiment with magnets to learn about the force of magnetism, and how magnetic fields relate to electric current. Build simple circuits consisting of the motor or generator, wires, and a light bulb to learn about the flow of electricity. Learn about gears and drive-trains and how they work to effectively convert kinetic energy into electrical energy and back again. \n\n The full-colour, 48-page manual guides your experiments with step-by-step instructions. \n\n Age 8+",

Work out which designs fly furthest, fastest or do the best acrobatics!\n\n The plane launcher uses two rotating wheels . A lot of energy is stored in the wheels when they are spinning. When you slip your paper plane in between, some of the energy is transferred to it and the plane is launched out at high speed.\n\n You can adjust the height of the legs on the plane launcher to launch the planes at different angles.\n\n An educational kit that demonstrates a scientific principle in a fun way. Assembly and operation of the toy should be supervised by an adult - they won\u2019t be able to help themselves - who doesn\u2019t love playing with paper planes, no matter what the age!\n\n Produced by award-winning toy manufacturer 4M, leaders in STEAM toys for kids.\n\n Educational but super fun nature of the toy makes it a winner with kids (and parents) - they don\u2019t even realise they are learning science and engineering skills while they are building and playing with this toy.\n\n Age 8+",

The clock has two removable number lines and three different face styles so children can practise telling time on clock styles they will see in the real world. The clock measures 12cm H. Ages 7+. Warning: SMALL PARTS Not for children under (three) 3 years.",

Children eight and up can safely and easily experiment with electric current and magnetic fields using the colourful snap-together blocks and components in this hands-on kit.\n\n Build series and parallel circuits to light up a light bulb. Experiment with push buttons and on-off switches. Assemble circuits that include a spinning motor, two switches, and up to three light bulbs.\n\n Conduct tests to see which materials are magnetic. Learn about the force of magnetism and magnetic poles. Magnetise a metal. Use iron fillings to make invisible magnetic fields visible. Investigate magnetic force and direction with a magnetic pendulum device. Learn how a compass works and about Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Conduct a series of experiments with a sturdy electromagnet.\n\n Finally, put everything you have learned to good use by constructing a loudspeaker, an electromagnetic relay switch, and a morse code telegraph key.\n\n The components are specially designed to make learning fun and accessible. The electrical blocks fit together with simple plug and- socket connectors. Because the blocks are brightly coloured and have unique shapes, it is easy to follow the assembly diagrams to construct functional devices.\n\n The 64-page, full-colour experiment manual guides you through experiments with easy-to follow diagrams.\n\n Age 8+",

Junior chemists can safely explore simple chemistry using the tools in this kit and common household substances from the kitchen and bathroom. Learn how to use basic chemistry equipment such as filters, test tubes, pipettes, and measuring spoons, and beakers. Make your own test tube racks out of plaster and learn about the chemical reaction that forms them. Conduct experiments to identify different chemicals using reactions, heat, evaporation, and crystallisation. Examine the composition of inks and dyes with chromatography experiments, where colours magically separate from one another on a filter paper disk. Explore the properties of water, soaps, and oils. Make fizzy reactions with acids and bases to dissolve shells and extinguish candles. Discover the invisible gas carbon dioxide and its very visible effects. The full-colour, 48-page manual guides inquisitive young chemists and their adult supervisors through safely conducting each of the 27 experiments. Age 8+",

Perfect for budding engineers and seasoned train enthusiasts, this all-in-one construction kit allows you to assemble your very own, classic train set. The joy of creating is at the heart of this product, offering a wonderful hands-on experience that promises hours of engagement for the whole family, from grown-ups to kids aged seven and up. Inside this charming tin, you'll discover everything you need to get your railway adventure rolling. The star of the show is the battery-operated engine, ready to chug along your custom-built tracks. Accompanying the engine are three diverse trucks designed to haul all sorts of imaginary cargo: a coal truck for fueling your locomotives, a passenger truck for transporting passengers to exciting destinations, and a long truck perfect for carrying larger goods. The track itself is a breeze to assemble, featuring six curved pieces that allow for sweeping bends and six straight pieces for those speedy straightaways. You can design and rearrange your track layout again and again, creating endless possibilities for your miniature railway. This kit encourages problem-solving, fine motor skills, and imaginative storytelling, making it a valuable addition to playtime. For the battery-operated engine to spring to life, you'll need just one AA battery, which is not included in the kit. Once assembled, the whole train and track system fits neatly back into the compact and sturdy tin, measuring approximately 14.5 x 10 x 5.5 cm, making it incredibly easy to store and transport for on-the-go fun. The Apples to Pears brand is known for its commitment to providing engaging and high-quality creative play experiences, and this wind-up train set is no exception, offering a tangible and rewarding activity that brings the magic of trains to life.",

The entire range is constructed using sustainably sourced timber and has been lovingly hand-painted using a dot painting technique.\n\n Each Nest box features a beautifully detailed hand-painted dot painting design. The Artisan Nest Boxes are made from sustainable timber and have a long lifespan due to the robust wood and water-based paint. Ensuring the nest box can be used for multiple seasons, sometimes as a nesting spot for the same returning garden birds. Provides a safe and secure habitat for small birds to roost and nest from autumn through the winter to spring when they will look to have their young.\n\n Nesting is most likely during April and May, and in the event of chicks hatching, there will be frenetic feeding activity by the parent birds. Take care not to disturb during this time as any intervention may result in the parent birds' eggs or young being abandoned.\n\n It is the perfect nest box for small bird species such as blue tits, coal tits, marsh tits, sparrows, and flycatchers, plus a delightful addition to your garden.",

Make small, medium and large-size crystals, or make different coloured crystals by mixing the red, blue and white seeding mixtures in different proportions. This science kit contains everything you need for successful crystal growing!\n\n First, pour one of the large bags of white crystal compound into some hot water (ideally boiling water) and stir to dissolve, using the stirring bowl. Later, pour this solution into one of the hexagonal transparent covers and leave to settle. Then gently sprinkle one of the small bags of seeding mixture onto the solution using the spoon. Leave in a warm room (on top of the fridge is good) and do not disturb \u2013 after a few days you\u2019ll have some great-looking crystals. And remember, the longer you leave them, the bigger they\u2019ll grow!\n\n Both fun and educational, with the Crystal Growing Experimental Kit you\u2019ll find out about saturated solutions, discover how particles behave in water and learn how crystals are formed.\n\n Crystals grow in seven basic shapes, called crystal systems. In each system the atoms or molecules that make up the crystal are stacked together in a different pattern. The crystal systems are called cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, monoclinic, triclinic, orthorhombic and rhombohedral.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * 3 x large bags of white crystal compound* (a base compound called Monoammonium Phosphate) \n * 3 x small bags containing seeding mixture* \n * 1 x large display base with hexagonal transparent cover \n * 2 x medium display bases with hexagonal transparent covers \n * 4 x small display bases with hexagonal transparent covers \n * 1 x stirring bowl, 1 x stirring spoon \n * 1 x large ring-shaped template \n * 2 x medium ring-shaped templates \n * 4 x small ring-shaped templates \n * Detailed Instructions and Safety Advice to reassure.

Through model building exercises you play the role of architect and engineer as you piece together an array of models, from small, basic structural elements like trusses, arches, and domes, to giant complex models of real-world buildings. Try recreating some of the world\u2019s most interesting buildings! With 20 guided model builds, you can construct stadiums, skyscrapers, a ferris wheel, and more.\n\n By getting hands-on with these exercises, you\u2019ll develop an understanding of how architectural engineers apply scientific principles to their designs and how the buildings and structures of the 21st century push materials and engineering to the limits. The 44-page, full-colour manual guides your journey while encouraging independent exploration. What is the tallest tower, the most voluminous dome, or the longest bridge you can build with the modular building pieces?

      "description": "Learn the fun foundational physics of simple machines!\n\n Jumpstart your study of mechanical physics by learning all about simple machines and how they\u2019re used to make complex tasks easier to do. Through 26 model-building exercises, you\u2019ll investigate all 6 classic simple machines \u2014 wheels and axles, levers, pulleys, inclined planes, screws, and wedges \u2014\u00a0as well as gears.\n\n Start off with simple models to guarantee a firm understanding of the basic principles at play, and then move onto larger, more complex models to push the machines harder and see how they can work together.\n\n Also included is a specially designed spring scale so that you can measure how the machines change the direction and magnitude of forces, making work easier to do. With this durable, modular construction system, you can see how the same basic elements combine in different ways to form each machine. The models can be assembled and disassembled again and again; combine the pieces to create your own configurations, limited only by your imagination!\n\n In addition to the invaluable hands-on experience you\u2019ll get from model building, the 32-page, full-colour manual also dives into examples of simple machines in action in everyday life. The seesaw at the playground, the wheelbarrow in your backyard, the flagpole in front of your school \u2014 all of these are examples of simple machines in the real world! So start building, investigating, and experimenting to discover how physics is all around us!\n\n Age 8+",

      "description": "Sight Word Swat Game An Engaging Educational Game for Young Readers to Master Sight Words with Fun and Speed Get ready for a reading adventure with the Sight Word Swat Game, a super fun and energetic way for children to become word-whiz kids! This game is designed to make learning essential sight words an absolute blast, building confidence with every swat. Sight words are those super important words that fluent readers recognize instantly, like magic! Some are easy to sound out, but others, the tricky ones, need a little memorization, and that's exactly where this game shines. Players grab their very own child-sized fly swatters, colorful and perfectly sized for little hands. As words are called out, it's a race to see who can spot and swat the fly card showing the correct sight word first! The player with the most swatted flies at the end of the round is declared the sight word champion! This game is fantastic for budding readers aged 4 and up, and it\u2019s perfect for family game nights, supporting 1 to 4 players. It\u2019s thoughtfully color-coded to align with the Letters & Sounds phonics program, making it a breeze to weave into learning, whether you're a parent or a teacher using various phonics approaches in UK primary schools. Inside this exciting box, you'll discover 300 high-frequency words, conveniently categorized from phases 2\u20136 of the Letters & Sounds framework, and the color-coding on the cards makes sorting and choosing them for play super simple. For those just starting their reading journey, you can begin with a smaller selection of cards from a particular phase, and as they grow more confident, you can introduce more cards or even mix in cards from different phases to add an extra layer of fun and challenge. We've even highlighted those \"tricky\" words with a special marker to gently remind little learners that these are the ones that can't be sounded out phonetically, encouraging them to memorize them. The game set includes 4 vibrant and durable fly swatters, each measuring a perfect 23cm, along with 150 double-sided fly cards packed with words, and easy-to-follow instructions to get the fun started right away. The plastic swatters are built to last through countless rounds of energetic play. This game is not just about memorization; it's about developing quick recognition skills and fostering a positive association with reading. The fast-paced nature of the game keeps little ones engaged and excited, transforming potentially challenging words into a thrilling challenge. It\u2019s an ideal way to supplement classroom learning or to enjoy an enriching playtime at home. Prepare for giggles, excitement, and a significant leap in reading fluency as your child becomes a master of sight words with the Sight Word Swat Game!",

This hands-on activity from Djeco encourages fine motor skills, artistic expression, and the joy of creating something unique and personal, all while providing a safe and fun place to store their most prized possessions. It\u2019s the perfect gift for any child who loves a good mystery and the thrill of discovery.",

      "description": "Do you ever wonder how bridges span huge distances and how skyscrapers stay standing? Structural engineers use physics and their knowledge of the properties of building materials and geometric shapes to design structures with sufficient strength and stability.\n\n With this kit of modular building pieces, you can learn the basics of structural engineering by conducting a series of 20 model-building experiments. Each model demonstrates a basic principle of mechanical physics or structural engineering in a hands-on way.\n\n Start out with small models that demonstrate how structural elements can be attached together to maximize the strength of a structure for a fixed amount of material used. Learn about basic structural elements including columns, beams, trusses, plates, arches, shells, and catenary. Explore the forces acting on structural components including tension, compression, shear, and bending.\n\n Move onto building more complex models of trusses, roofs, and small buildings. Experiment with different types of bridge construction: a truss bridge, arch bridge, cantilever bridge, rope bridge, and suspension bridge. Finally, build models of towering skyscrapers. What is the tallest tower you can build using only the pieces included in the kit?\n\n Learn about the strength and stiffness of materials. See how structural engineers optimize factors to maximize safety, and minimize cost and the risk of structural failure.\n\n A 36-page, full-color manual guides you through model building with step-by-step illustrated instructions.\n\n  \n Age 8-14.",

There may be times when it seems impossible, but there will ALWAYS be at least one solution... and that\u2019s why it\u2019s called The Genius Star!\n\n Roll the seven dice and place a \u2018blocker\u2019 piece into the triangle matching the seven numbers that appear on the faces. Now race your opponent to fill every other space on the grid using the 11 shapes.\n\n There is also a wonderful new twist to each challenge, in the shape of a \u2018Golden Star\u2019. Will you play safe and complete a regular win, or will you go for a double win, by completing the challenge with the \u2018Golden Star\u2019 in one piece? Only 57.4% of the puzzles actually have a solution with the \u2018Golden Star\u2019 whole, so it\u2019s a tough decision to make. You\u2019ll need speed of thought... and nerves of steel! There\u2019s also a web page where you can input your coordinates and find out whether the \u2018Golden Star\u2019 can be completed in one piece!\n\n Age 8+",

      "title": "Gecko Marble Run Starter Pack",
      "description": "Gecko Run takes classic marble runs to the next level with new creative challenges and less restrictive building requirements. This innovative marble run uses a specially designed system of flexible tracks that does not require any support structures. Traditional marble runs require lots of pieces to create vertical height, but with Gecko Run, your doors, windows, cupboards, bookcases \u2013 virtually any smooth surface \u2013 become part of your track, allowing you to build higher with fewer pieces. Attach the tracks to surfaces with the help of clever nano pads, which work like nanoscopic suction cups, to create a strong, but temporary bond. Because the pads are not glue-based, they can be quickly and easily repositioned many times without damaging adhesives or sticky residue. A quick wipe with a microfiber cloth will keep your pads ready for action! The versatile tracks are made from renewable, durable, and sustainably sourced raw materials. Thanks to their wide range of motion and flexibility, you can create hills and jumps, and even turn corners to generate a limitless number of tricks and stunts. No two tracks are ever the same! Each unique configuration promotes hands-on experimentation, supports problem-solving through trial-and-error, develops motor skills, and encourages creativity for kids and their grown-ups! The Gecko Run Starter Set includes everything you need to zip, zag, bounce, skip, and hurdle into an awesome engineering adventure. A 16-page illustrated manual guides you through setting up your first runs and teaches you how all the different elements work. Witness physics in action! Use independently or combine with any of the expansion packs. Intuitive: Tracks attach to smooth surfaces with the help of clever nano-adhesive pads that stick to smooth, vertical surfaces around your home Mess-free: The pads are not glue-based and can be quickly and easily repositioned without leaving behind damage or sticky residue. Open-Ended: Position in endless configurations on smooth surfaces Educational: Develop engineering and problem-solving skills, and see physics in action Tracks made from renewable raw materials Additional stunts available in expansion packs (sold separately) Conduct an action-packed series of hands-on physics and engineering lessons with an easy, modular building system. Piece together the sturdy frame structures and then attach the flexible track to it to build and test endless roller coaster designs. Experiment by varying the weight of the cars and varying the slope, length, and direction of the track. Get a practical introduction to many physics principles including gravitation, potential energy, kinetic energy, free fall, projectile motion, friction, centripetal force, velocity, acceleration, and more. Conduct a series of engineering challenges: What is the tallest roller coaster you can build? How about the longest straightaway? Can you build a loop-de-loop? A large, full-color manual guides you through the model assembly and experiments with step-by-step illustrated instructions. + Design and build your own working roller coaster models. + Conduct hands-on physics experiments to learn about force, motion, and energy. + Complete challenges that require you to build roller coasters of all shapes and sizes. + Plastic building system is durable, easy-to-assemble, and reusable. + Full-colour manual with step-by-step assembly instructions and scientific explanations Age 8+",

      "description": "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

      "title": "My First Coding and Robotics",
      "description": "My First Coding and Robotics is a brilliant starter kit to teach coding principles with a cute little robot. You don\u2019t need a tablet, smartphone, or computer to program this robot; programs are created by simply laying down a sequence of physical code cards. As the robot drives over the code cards, an Optical identifier sensor or optical scanner on the bottom of the robot, reads the code cards one by one and loads the program. Next, place the robot on a grid made of map cards, and the robot runs the program. You can program the robot to move in different directions, activate its output gear, light up its LED, play sounds, and respond to different function cards. The integrated output gear makes it possible to build simple robotic creations with arms or other moving parts that respond according to the program\u2019s instructions. This robot kit also teaches physical engineering and problem solving skills through a series of building and coding lessons. The 30 lessons are aligned with standards for computer science education developed by the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the International Society for Technology (ISTE) Education, as well as courses from Code.org. The lessons or activities progress in complexity through the illustrated manual, allowing the kit to be appropriate for a child as young as four years with help from an adult and as old as eight years. The lessons cover these six key areas in coding: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables. In addition to Sammy (the robot), there are five other stories, each with a series of model-building and coding challenges and lessons related to it: a mouse moves through a maze to find cheese; a penguin wanders around a zoo; a soccer player moves a ball into the goal; a fire truck puts out a fire; and a factory robot performs tasks in a factory scene. A full-colour illustrated manual guides users through the coding lessons and the assembly of the different models. Requires 3 AA batteries, supplied separately. Ages 4 to 8 years.",

      "title": "Gecko Marble Run Starter Pack",
      "description": "Gecko Run takes classic marble runs to the next level with new creative challenges and less restrictive building requirements. This innovative marble run uses a specially designed system of flexible tracks that does not require any support structures. Traditional marble runs require lots of pieces to create vertical height, but with Gecko Run, your doors, windows, cupboards, bookcases \u2013 virtually any smooth surface \u2013 become part of your track, allowing you to build higher with fewer pieces. \n\n Attach the tracks to surfaces with the help of clever nano pads, which work like nanoscopic suction cups, to create a strong, but temporary bond. Because the pads are not glue-based, they can be quickly and easily repositioned many times without damaging adhesives or sticky residue. A quick wipe with a microfiber cloth will keep your pads ready for action! \n\n The versatile tracks are made from renewable, durable, and sustainably sourced raw materials. Thanks to their wide range of motion and flexibility, you can create hills and jumps, and even turn corners to generate a limitless number of tricks and stunts. No two tracks are ever the same! Each unique configuration promotes hands-on experimentation, supports problem-solving through trial-and-error, develops motor skills, and encourages creativity for kids and their grown-ups! \n\n The Gecko Run Starter Set includes everything you need to zip, zag, bounce, skip, and hurdle into an awesome engineering adventure. A 16-page illustrated manual guides you through setting up your first runs and teaches you how all the different elements work. Witness physics in action! Use independently or combine with any of the expansion packs.\n\n  \n *  Intuitive: Tracks attach to smooth surfaces with the help of clever nano-adhesive pads that stick to smooth, vertical surfaces around your home\n  \n * Mess-free: The pads are not glue-based and can be quickly and easily repositioned without leaving behind damage or sticky residue. \n *  Open-Ended: Position in endless configurations on smooth surfaces\u00a0\n  \n * Educational: Develop engineering and problem-solving skills, and see physics in action \n * Tracks made from renewable raw materials \n * Additional stunts available in expansion packs (sold separately)  Conduct an action-packed series of hands-on physics and engineering lessons with an easy, modular building system. Piece together the sturdy frame structures and then attach the flexible track to it to build and test endless roller coaster designs.\n\n Experiment by varying the weight of the cars and varying the slope, length, and direction of the track. Get a practical introduction to many physics principles including gravitation, potential energy, kinetic energy, free fall, projectile motion, friction, centripetal force, velocity, acceleration, and more.\n\n Conduct a series of engineering challenges: What is the tallest roller coaster you can build? How about the longest straightaway? Can you build a loop-de-loop? A large, full-color manual guides you through the model assembly and experiments with step-by-step illustrated instructions.\n\n + Design and build your own working roller coaster models.\n\n + Conduct hands-on physics experiments to learn about force, motion, and energy.\n\n + Complete challenges that require you to build roller coasters of all shapes and sizes.\n\n + Plastic building system is durable, easy-to-assemble, and reusable.\n\n + Full-colour manual with step-by-step assembly instructions and scientific explanations\n\n Age 8+",

      "description": "Little ones will be captivated by our FSC 100% Rolling Activity Sorter. There are four sides packed with activities including a wooden shape sorter, wooden flip book, wooden cogs and more. Its rolling nature makes it a fun task for toddlers to push along the ground as they toddle along. Little fingers can touch, pull, twist, turn, and flip all the different wooden elements on the four sides of the activity roller. This helps them to develop their dexterity and fine motor skills as they explore each side. At the top is a shape sorter where busy hands need to slot the wooden shapes through the correct slot. The activity sorter also opens up for easy access to the wooden shapes, too. Made from FSC\u00ae Certified materials (FSC\u00ae C147826), this shape sorter has been made in the most ethical way possible. The quality of the wood also means it has many years of play in it. Conform to current European safety standards.\n\n Age 12+",

Jumpstart your study of mechanical physics by learning all about simple machines and how they\u2019re used to make complex tasks easier to do. Through 26 model-building exercises, you\u2019ll investigate all 6 classic simple machines \u2014 wheels and axles, levers, pulleys, inclined planes, screws, and wedges \u2014 as well as gears. Start off with simple models to guarantee a firm understanding of the basic principles at play, and then move onto larger, more complex models to push the machines harder and see how they can work together. Also included is a specially designed spring scale so that you can measure how the machines change the direction and magnitude of forces, making work easier to do. With this durable, modular construction system, you can see how the same basic elements combine in different ways to form each machine. The models can be assembled and disassembled again and again; combine the pieces to create your own configurations, limited only by your imagination! In addition to the invaluable hands-on experience you\u2019ll get from model building, the 32-page, full-colour manual also dives into examples of simple machines in action in everyday life. The seesaw at the playground, the wheelbarrow in your backyard, the flagpole in front of your school \u2014 all of these are examples of simple machines in the real world!

      "description": "Castle of Knights Imagination World Unleash Your Inner Storyteller with Our Enchanting Castle Adventure! Get ready for an epic quest where your child's imagination reigns supreme! The Castle of Knights Imagination World is more than just a toy; it's a portal to endless adventures where heroes and heroines embark on thrilling escapades. At its heart lies a magnificent giant poster, a sprawling kingdom just waiting to be brought to life by your little one's creativity. This isn't just any poster; it's a vibrant backdrop for magnificent tales, a canvas for dreams to unfold. Accompanying this grand scene are 11 meticulously crafted puzzles, each piece a stepping stone towards building not just a castle, but a whole world of possibilities. Assembling these puzzles is a delightful challenge that hones fine motor skills and problem-solving abilities, making learning an exciting part of the play. But the magic doesn't stop there! We've included 15 charming characters, each designed with adorable details to spark joy and inspire grand narratives. These aren't static figures; they are ready to be animated, to jump into action as brave knights, wise kings, or even mischievous dragons! And for an extra touch of personality, we've added 36 sticky eyes, allowing your child to give each character a unique and expressive look, further enhancing their storytelling potential. Imagine the giggles as they peel and stick, giving their knights determined stares or their princesses curious glances. The joy of imitation and animation is a powerful way to develop empathy and understanding of character. This captivating set encourages children aged 3-6 to invent their very own stories, fostering unparalleled creativity and imagination. It's a fantastic way to exercise fine craftsmanship as they handle the pieces and characters, building confidence with every successful creation. Beyond the imaginative play, this activity subtly strengthens cognitive skills, encouraging a playful approach to problem-solving. The act of putting the puzzles together, arranging the characters on the poster, and creating narratives all contribute to a well-rounded developmental experience, all wrapped up in a delightful, family-friendly package. It\u2019s an invitation to explore, to create, and to become the hero of their own magical kingdom, filled with friendly faces and exciting quests.

Thanks to the robot\u2019s main component, a motorized gyroscope, it can maintain its balance and perform this fun trick without falling over. Through five experiments, you can discover the astonishing powers of the motorized gyroscope and explore the physics behind its amazing behaviors. Experiment with getting the gyrobot to walk on the different included tracks and on a string, investigate the gyrobot\u2019s center of gravity, play a ring-toss game, and watch the gyrobot spin on a flat surface Through 8 experiments, you can explore the astonishing powers of the motorised gyroscope and understand the physics behind its amazing behaviours. Experiment with getting the robot to walk on different surfaces: a tightrope, on a solid tabletop, on a soft surface, and even on your arm! You can also experiment with the balancing behaviour of the motorised gyroscope by itself, testing its ability to balance on its edge, on your finger, on a pole, and dangling from a string. Build a one-of-a-kind apple robot that defies gravity! Thanks to the robot\u2019s main component, a motorized gyroscope, this special apple can walk along a tightrope without falling. Explore the physics behind this scientific device through five unique experiments that investigate gravity. The unique and functional design makes this an affordable, fun, and educational gift with high play value. The kit includes parts to build the gyrobot and experimental setups, including a track to walk around. By constructing the robot and performing the experiments with the motorised gyroscope unit, young engineers can learn about the science of gyroscopic devices and the indispensable role they play in our lives. A full-colour, 8-page, illustrated experiment manual provides step-by-step assembly instructions and scientific explanations. Requires: 3 x AAA Batteries (Not Included) Ages 8 to 14 years.",

Mental Blox contains 20 colourful plastic blocks in 4 different shapes and 10 different designs, together with 20 double-sided cards showing different things to build or replicate with the blocks.\n\n Each player or team has 10 blocks, 1 of each design. The aim of the game is to replicate the image on a card, using the different blocks, but beware - some cards are harder than others!\n\n To making this even more interesting and challenging, one person can instead describe the pictures, giving the other players only verbal clues to make each structure. This is hard, but great fun! There are also follow-up questions on the cards to help improve spatial and critical thinking.\n\n Contents:\n\n 20 plastic blocks (2 sets of 10)\n\n 20 Double-sided activity cards\n\n Activity Guide\n\n The box is perfect for storage, with a place for everything so the blocks can be put away quickly and easily at the end of play.\n\n For 3 or more players\n\n Age 5+",

      "description": "Glitter Fairies: Sparkle and Create Your Own Magical Fairy World Get ready for an enchanting adventure with Glitter Fairies, the ultimate arts and crafts set that lets young artists bring their very own sparkly fairy world to life! This delightful activity, designed for budding creatives aged 7 to 13, offers a captivating and mess-free way to unleash imagination. Inside this wonderful box, you'll discover four beautifully semi-illustrated boards, each a miniature canvas waiting to be adorned with shimmering magic. These boards feature intricate designs, showcasing graceful fairies nestled amongst a vibrant tapestry of colourful flowers and cheerful birds, setting the stage for a truly magical creation. The magic unfolds as little ones peel off the numbered sections of the boards. Beneath these peel-away layers lie sticky areas, perfectly primed to catch the dazzling glitter. Six vibrant tubes of glitter in a spectrum of delightful colours are provided, each precisely matched to the numbered sections for guidance. Children simply sprinkle the designated colour of glitter over the sticky area. Once covered, they use the included soft brush to gently smooth the glitter, ensuring every inch is covered with an even, spectacular sheen. The thoughtful design of the box itself is a stroke of genius, acting as a handy workspace. Any excess glitter can be easily collected within the box and poured back into its tube, making clean-up a breeze and ensuring absolutely no glitter goes to waste \u2013 hooray for mess-free fun! This hands-on approach not only fosters artistic expression but also helps develop fine motor skills as children carefully peel, sprinkle, and brush. It's a fantastic way to explore colours and designs, nurture creativity, and encourage a love for art in a truly engaging and enjoyable manner. The board size of 15 x 21cm is perfect for little hands to manage, and the addition of a handy peeler stick further enhances the ease and fun of the crafting experience, making it a joy for both children and parents alike. This is more than just a craft kit; it's an invitation to step into a world of imagination and create something truly beautiful.",

      "description": "The Genius Star! Play solo, or race an opponent to fill the star! The aim of each of the 165,888 possible puzzles is to complete the star using the eleven coloured shapes, once the seven \u2018blockers\u2019 have been positioned. There may be times when it seems impossible, but there will ALWAYS be at least one solution... and that\u2019s why it\u2019s called The Genius Star! Roll the seven dice and place a \u2018blocker\u2019 piece into the triangle matching the seven numbers that appear on the faces. Now race your opponent to fill every other space on the grid using the 11 shapes. There is also a wonderful new twist to each challenge, in the shape of a \u2018Golden Star\u2019. Will you play safe and complete a regular win, or will you go for a double win, by completing the challenge with the \u2018Golden Star\u2019 in one piece? Only 57.4% of the puzzles actually have a solution with the \u2018Golden Star\u2019 whole, so it\u2019s a tough decision to make. You\u2019ll need speed of thought... and nerves of steel! There\u2019s also a web page where you can input your coordinates and find out whether the \u2018Golden Star\u2019 can be completed in one piece! Age 8+",

      "description": "Learning Resources Hoot the Fine Motor Owl is the wise toy for toddlers that helps develop fundamental fine motor skills. Designed to build and strengthen the different areas of hand strength and coordination included in school readiness checklists, Hoot helps kids prepare for preschool success with four fun activities. The grip and twisting actions are great for developing pen holding skills needed at school. Kids practice pincer grip, great for scissor control, by spinning Hoot's eyes, build hand strength by squeaking Hoot's nose, and work on hand-eye coordination by dropping four coins into Hoot's slot. Once the coins are inside, use scissor skills to flap Hoot's wings and send the coins tumbling out of his sides! It's a friendly twist on the usual fine motor games for kids! Parts store inside Hoot's slot for easy clean-up. Educational Benefits of Learning Resources Hoot the Fine Motor Owl Fine Motor Skills. Colours & Shapes. Reinforces Number Recognition. Contains: 1 Hoot Owl. 5 play coins, colours vary. Size: 17.8 x 9.5 x 20.3cm. Ages 18 months - 5 years. Educational Video of Learning Resources Hoot the Fine Motor Owl",

If they pick up one of the yucky 'tummy ache' cards, they must shout out 'Tummy ache!' and place it on their board to be replaced later in the game\n\n The winner is the first player to fill their playing board with five food cards to make an edible meal.\n\n Children find this game quick and easy to play and understand, and will be screeching with laughter at the horrible bugs, slugs and worms they can see amongst their everyday foods! It is also a great way to teach children about turn taking and encouraging communication by asking them to talk about their favourite food. Tummy Ache is perfect to play in school with friends, or at home with family.\n\n Not suitable for children under 3 years due to small parts. Choking hazard.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * 4 jigged place setting boards \n * 20 food cards \n * 10 Tummy Ache cards \n * Instruction leaflet",

The playset changes seamlessly from the Theatre to Shop, encouraging endless hours of creative play.\n\n Simply raise the theatre curtain with the rotating, clicking dial and reverse the fabric to reveal the market stall roof. What to play today? Shall we put on a show for Mum and Dad? Or, open up the shop so friends and family can stock up on play food!\n\n The Theatre features a chalkboard & clock, to advertise the next play and time. Plus, 50 tickets to dispense through the ticket machine slot and give to those attending the show! During the show there are shelves that can be used to store puppets and props.\n\n Ignite imagination and creativity. The Shop features a market stall design with a fabric roof and countertop area. Plus, 3 angled shelves that will hold the Tidlo Food Crates (sold separately), and a removable chalk panel.\n\n Learning through play. A great way to develop storytelling skills, confidence, build vocabulary and learn about different emotions. It will enrich their imagination by inspiring creativity and self-expression. Switching between the theatre and shop is simple enough for children to do alone. With a sturdy wooden construction, this playset is sure to last years of imaginative play. Easy assembly (for the adults!).\n\n Age 3+",

      "description": "An apple that defies gravity and walks a tightrope \u2014 what would Isaac Newton have thought? Build a cute apple robot that walks along a tightrope. How? Thanks to the robot\u2019s main component, a motorized gyroscope, it can maintain its balance and perform this fun trick without falling over.\n\n Through five experiments, you can discover the astonishing powers of the motorized gyroscope and explore the physics behind its amazing behaviors. Experiment with getting the gyrobot to walk on the different included tracks and on a string, investigate the gyrobot\u2019s center of gravity, play a ring-toss game, and watch the gyrobot spin on a flat surface\n\n Through 8 experiments, you can explore the astonishing powers of the motorised gyroscope and understand the physics behind its amazing behaviours. Experiment with getting the robot to walk on different surfaces: a tightrope, on a solid tabletop, on a soft surface, and even on your arm! You can also experiment with the balancing behaviour of the motorised gyroscope by itself, testing its ability to balance on its edge, on your finger, on a pole, and dangling from a string.\n\n  \n * Build a one-of-a-kind apple robot that defies gravity! \n * Thanks to the robot\u2019s main component, a motorized gyroscope, this special apple can walk along a tightrope without falling. \n * Explore the physics behind this scientific device through five unique experiments that investigate gravity. \n * The unique and functional design makes this an affordable, fun, and educational gift with high play value. \n * The kit includes parts to build the gyrobot and experimental setups, including a track to walk around. \n * By constructing the robot and performing the experiments with the motorised gyroscope unit, young engineers can learn about the science of gyroscopic devices and the indispensable role they play in our lives. \n * A full-colour, 8-page, illustrated experiment manual provides step-by-step assembly instructions and scientific explanations.  Requires: 3 x AAA Batteries (Not Included)\n\n Ages 8 to 14 years.",

Children eight and up can safely and easily experiment with electric current and magnetic fields using the colourful snap-together blocks and components in this hands-on kit. Build series and parallel circuits to light up a light bulb. Experiment with push buttons and on-off switches. Assemble circuits that include a spinning motor, two switches, and up to three light bulbs. Conduct tests to see which materials are magnetic. Learn about the force of magnetism and magnetic poles. Magnetise a metal. Use iron fillings to make invisible magnetic fields visible. Investigate magnetic force and direction with a magnetic pendulum device. Learn how a compass works and about Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Conduct a series of experiments with a sturdy electromagnet. Finally, put everything you have learned to good use by constructing a loudspeaker, an electromagnetic relay switch, and a morse code telegraph key. The components are specially designed to make learning fun and accessible. The electrical blocks fit together with simple plug and- socket connectors. Because the blocks are brightly coloured and have unique shapes, it is easy to follow the assembly diagrams to construct functional devices. The 64-page, full-colour experiment manual guides you through experiments with easy-to follow diagrams. Age 8+",

      "description": "Enroll in CHEM C1000 and prepare for a lifetime of fascination with this essential science through 128 diverse experiments. Start with an introduction to the field of chemistry and famous chemists. Set up your lab space and learn how to safely handle the lab equipment and chemicals.\n\n Learn about indicators with litmus solution and write a secret message in invisible ink. Test the inks from your coloured markers on the chromatography racetrack to reveal their different colour components. Experiment with air pressure, surface tension, and the physical properties of fluids.\n\n Experiment with two well-known metals, iron and copper. Investigate carbon dioxide. Dissolve metals with electrochemical reactions. Explore water and its elements, saturated and unsaturated solutions, and crystals. Split water into hydrogen and oxygen with electrolysis, and form oxygen from hydrogen peroxide.\n\n Experiment with soaps, detergents, and emulsions of water and oil. Investigate chemistry in the kitchen by experimenting with sugar, honey, starch, eggs and proteins, fatty acids, and calcium.\n\n Begin to build a strong foundation in chemistry with exposure to a broad range of chemical phenomena and hands-on laboratory experiences. This kit provides clear instructions for preparing and performing the experiments, offers safety advice, offers explanations for the observed occurrences, and asks and answers questions about the results.\n\n Thorough safety precautions and instructions ensure safe experimentation. Professional quality equipment helps you make the most of your chemistry experiments. The 80-page, full-colour experiment manual guides aspiring young chemists through each of the 128 experiments. \n\n\n  \n Age 10 and above",

      "description": "Soaring spires, towering arches, fascinatingly complex curves and angles! Build your foundation in architectural design with this fascinating STEM experiment kit that explores the engineering principles behind planning and developing buildings and structures. Through model building exercises you play the role of architect and engineer as you piece together an array of models, from small, basic structural elements like trusses, arches, and domes, to giant complex models of real-world buildings. Try recreating some of the world\u2019s most interesting buildings! With 20 guided model builds, you can construct stadiums, skyscrapers, a ferris wheel, and more. By getting hands-on with these exercises, you\u2019ll develop an understanding of how architectural engineers apply scientific principles to their designs and how the buildings and structures of the 21st century push materials and engineering to the limits. The 44-page, full-colour manual guides your journey while encouraging independent exploration. What is the tallest tower, the most voluminous dome, or the longest bridge you can build with the modular building pieces? How will you use what you learn to further your architectural journey?

      "title": "My First Coding and Robotics: Build & Code Fun Robots, Easy Card Programming for Kids Ages 4-8, No Computer Needed STEM Learning Toy",
      "description": "My First Coding and Robotics Kit: A Fun Journey into Programming and Engineering! Get ready for an exciting adventure into the world of coding and robotics with the My First Coding and Robotics Kit! This fantastic set is designed to introduce young minds, ages 4 to 8, to the fundamentals of programming in a super engaging and hands-on way. Forget about needing screens or complex devices; this kit uses clever physical code cards that your adorable robot pal, Sammy, reads with its special optical identifier sensor on its underside. Simply lay out a sequence of these code cards, and watch as Sammy understands its mission! Once programmed, place Sammy on a grid made of map cards, and get ready to see your creations come to life! Sammy can be programmed to zoom in different directions, activate its integrated output gear for fun moving parts like arms, flash its colorful LED lights, and even play cheerful sounds. The possibilities are endless as your child learns to think like a programmer and an engineer. The built-in output gear is a game-changer, allowing kids to build simple robotic creations that respond to their coded commands, fostering creativity and a sense of accomplishment. This kit is more than just play; it's a brilliant introduction to physical engineering and essential problem-solving skills through a series of progressively challenging building and coding lessons. These 30 illustrated lessons are expertly crafted and aligned with important computer science education standards from organizations like CSTA and ISTE, and even courses from Code.org, ensuring a valuable learning experience. The full-color illustrated manual, which can be accessed online for convenience, provides step-by-step guidance for both coding lessons and model assembly, making it perfect for adult-child collaboration or independent exploration for older kids. The lessons cleverly cover six key coding areas: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables, all presented in a way that feels like fun and discovery. Sammy isn't the only star; the kit includes five other engaging stories with related model-building and coding challenges. Imagine a mouse navigating a maze to find cheese, a penguin exploring a zoo, a soccer player scoring a goal, a fire truck bravely putting out a blaze, or a factory robot efficiently completing its tasks. Each scenario provides a unique context for applying learned coding concepts. To power Sammy's adventures, you'll need 3 AA batteries, which are conveniently supplied separately. This kit truly makes learning about technology an enjoyable and accessible experience for the whole family.",
