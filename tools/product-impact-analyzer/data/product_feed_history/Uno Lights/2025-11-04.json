The transparent design of the connector seamlessly blends with any aluminum profile you choose, enhancing the overall aesthetic of your project. Its slim profile allows it to fit into most aluminum profiles, making it a versatile option for various applications. The transparent construction prevents any obstruction of light output, guaranteeing a smooth and consistent glow.
