The Clamp Mount WallMaster Twin is supplied with 2 fitted hose clamps that enable the unit to be mounted to any upright such as warehouse racking, columns or pillars. Choose between 3 standard clamp sizes or contact us if you require a custom size. The belt is supplied with an s-clip belt end designed to wrap around objects and clip back onto the belt. Alternatively you can select to have standard or magnetic belt ends during the order process. WallMaster is a range of high quality low cost wall mount barriers for restricting access to corridors and aisle ways. Manufactured with a steel housing WallMaster is available in 2 stock finish options. The belt features a slow-retracting brake system along with a locking belt end and is available in over 30 different colours and safety messages.

      "description": "\u2013 Vertical Belt Barrier Cart<p>The <strong>Vertical Belt Barrier Cart</strong> provides an efficient and reliable way to transport and store multiple stanchions in one compact unit. Designed for busy venues, warehouses, and event spaces, this cart keeps your queue posts organised and ready for rapid setup. It combines strength, capacity, and convenience to improve workflow. Because it allows quick loading and smooth movement, staff can handle equipment safely and efficiently between events.</p>High Capacity and Easy Loading<p>Each cart holds up to <strong>18 stanchions</strong>, making it a high-capacity yet space-saving solution. The low-lift loading design means you only raise posts 305&nbsp;mm, which reduces strain and speeds up setup and breakdown. In addition, the vertical storage layout keeps every post secure and upright, ready to move to the next event. This efficient design prevents damage to posts and saves valuable time during transport.</p>Strong, Stable, and Easy to Move<p>Four heavy-duty steering wheels give this <strong>belt barrier cart</strong> exceptional manoeuvrability, even in tight corridors. Moreover, the locking wheels keep the cart steady while loading or unloading, ensuring complete control and safety. With a width of 0.8&nbsp;m and a loaded height of 1.3&nbsp;m, it passes easily through standard doorways. Therefore, the cart suits hotels, arenas, and warehouses where smooth, secure movement is essential.</p>Durable Construction and Compatibility<p>The reinforced steel frame withstands frequent movement and heavy use across different surfaces. Furthermore, it fits <strong>50&nbsp;mm to&nbsp;76&nbsp;mm diameter stanchions</strong> with base diameters up to 356&nbsp;mm, ensuring compatibility with most belt barrier models. However, please note that this cart is not suitable for WeatherMaster outdoor posts.</p>Organised Crowd Control Management<p>Use the <strong>Vertical Belt Barrier Cart</strong> to streamline storage, improve handling, and protect your investment in queue management equipment. As a result, venues can reduce labour time, minimise damage, and maintain a tidy, professional environment. Additionally, its compact form allows you to store barriers neatly while keeping them ready for immediate use.</p><p>Explore our full range of belt barrier carts here.<br>For official pedestrian safety advice, visit the HSE website.</p>",

      "description": "Red Steel Crowd Barricade \u2013 1.8 m Compact ModelThe <strong>Red Steel Crowd Barricade</strong> combines high visibility with a tough welded frame for fast, reliable crowd control. At 1.8\u00a0m long with removable feet, it stores flat, moves easily, and links quickly to form straight runs or gentle angles. Moreover, its compact form allows it to fit comfortably in tight areas where full-sized barriers may be impractical. Because of that, it\u2019s ideal for smaller venues, pop-up markets, and temporary access points that require quick, efficient setup.Key features of this red metal barricade<ul> <li><strong>Compact length (1.8 m):</strong> perfect for restricted spaces and quick layouts.</li> <li><strong>Durable construction:</strong> welded steel frame with a long-lasting purple finish for added visibility.</li> <li><strong>Removable feet:</strong> detach easily for flat stacking and safe transport.</li> <li><strong>Hook-and-loop ends:</strong> connect panels securely with consistent alignment.</li> <li><strong>Smooth top rail:</strong> improves safety for both crowds and staff.</li></ul>Where this Red Steel Crowd Barricade works bestYou can use this <strong>red crowd control barricade</strong> at festivals, stadiums, retail queues, schools, construction sites, and transport hubs. It helps define entrances and exits while clearly marking restricted areas without obstructing walkways. Additionally, its bold red finish stands out in busy environments, guiding foot traffic even from a distance. Because the steel frame resists impact and weather exposure, it performs equally well indoors and outdoors.Setup, linking, and storage tipsSetting up the <strong>Red Steel Crowd Barricade</strong> is quick and straightforward. First, attach the feet, then place the initial panel in position. After that, link additional units together until you reach the required length. Each hook-and-loop connection provides stability and smooth alignment. For longer moves, stack panels flat on a trolley to reduce handling time. When dismantling, the removable feet make disassembly faster and easier. Furthermore, by labelling stacks by colour, teams can deploy specific barrier zones quickly at multi-area events.Safety and planningEffective crowd management always starts with planning. Therefore, assess routes, crowd capacity, and emergency access before each event. In addition, ensure all barricades are placed to maintain safe spacing and clear visibility. Follow official UK guidance on crowd management from the HSEhere. With careful preparation, you\u2019ll create safer and more efficient spaces for both visitors and staff.Related products<ul> <li>All metal barricades</li> <li>Barricade Storage Option</li> <li>Safety Guidance</li></ul>Specifications<ul> <li>Length: 1.8\u00a0m (compact)</li> <li>Frame: welded steel</li> <li>Finish: red, high-visibility</li> <li>Feet: removable, stack-friendly</li> <li>Connections: hook-and-loop ends</li> <li>Use: indoor and outdoor (as conditions allow)</li></ul>SummaryOverall, the <strong>Red Steel Crowd Barricade</strong> provides durable crowd control, fast layouts, and excellent visibility for events and public spaces.

Its heavy-duty steel mounting plate keeps the unit secure, even with frequent use. Because it mounts directly to a wall or post, it keeps aisles and walkways clear of trip hazards. The slow-retracting brake system provides smooth, safe belt retraction, reducing the risk of snapping or injury during operation.</p>Flexible Belt End Options<p>You can choose from three practical belt end fittings: a <strong>locking end</strong> for permanent attachment, an <strong>S-clip end</strong> for standard posts, or a <strong>magnetic end</strong> for fast, tool-free connection to metal surfaces. Each option ensures the belt remains firmly in place until intentionally released. The enclosed cassette design protects the webbing from dirt and wear, extending the product\u2019s life even in harsh conditions.</p>Perfect for Industrial and Commercial Use<p>The <strong>WallPro 750</strong> suits warehouses, factories, airports, and maintenance zones. It\u2019s ideal for temporarily closing aisles, securing restricted areas, or controlling vehicle bays. The extended belt reduces the need for multiple units, saving time and installation effort while maintaining professional site safety. </p><p>Need a fully magnetic version?

Designed for retail environments, event venues, and any space requiring crowd management, this robust cart boasts a generous capacity for 18 stanchions, ensuring you can neatly store and move a significant number of your crowd control barriers. It is available in multiple diameter sizes, specifically accommodating stanchions with a 50mm, 64mm, or 76mm diameter.

These slots are engineered to provide a snug and secure fit, preventing any unwanted movement or slippage during transport. Ordering the incorrect size could lead to stanchions not fitting properly or, worse, potentially sliding out of the rack, compromising safety and organization.

Safety and ease of use are paramount in its design. The cart is equipped with smooth-rolling steering wheels that offer exceptional maneuverability, allowing you to navigate tight corners and crowded spaces with confidence. For added security and stability when the cart is stationary or being loaded and unloaded, it features locking wheels. These wheels can be engaged to prevent any accidental rolling, ensuring a safe and controlled operation. A protective rubber bumper encircles the cart, serving as a vital safeguard against scuffs and marks on walls and other surrounding surfaces. This attention to detail means you can move your stanchions without worry about damaging your facility. It's important to note that this specific horizontal storage cart is optimized for standard post stanchions and is not compatible with dome base or triple belt stanchions, nor is it designed for use with the All WeatherMasters series.

For businesses looking to enhance their brand visibility and create a more cohesive visual environment, custom belt printing is readily available.

At 1.8\u00a0m long with removable feet, it stores flat, moves easily, and links quickly to form straight runs or gentle angles. Moreover, its compact form allows it to fit comfortably in tight areas where full-sized barriers may be impractical. Because of that, it\u2019s ideal for smaller venues, pop-up markets, and temporary access points that require quick, efficient setup.Key features of this Yellow Steel Crowd Barricade<ul> <li><strong>Compact length (1.8 m):</strong> perfect for restricted spaces and quick layouts.</li> <li><strong>Durable construction:</strong> welded steel frame with a long-lasting purple finish for added visibility.</li> <li><strong>Removable feet:</strong> detach easily for flat stacking and safe transport.</li> <li><strong>Hook-and-loop ends:</strong> connect panels securely with consistent alignment.</li> <li><strong>Smooth top rail:</strong> improves safety for both crowds and staff.</li></ul>Where this Yellow Steel Crowd Barricade works bestYou can use this <strong>red crowd control barricade</strong> at festivals, stadiums, retail queues, schools, construction sites, and transport hubs. It helps define entrances and exits while clearly marking restricted areas without obstructing walkways. Additionally, its bold red finish stands out in busy environments, guiding foot traffic even from a distance. Because the steel frame resists impact and weather exposure, it performs equally well indoors and outdoors.Setup, linking, and storage tipsSetting up the <strong>Yellow Steel Crowd Barricade</strong> is quick and straightforward. First, attach the feet, then place the initial panel in position. After that, link additional units together until you reach the required length. Each hook-and-loop connection provides stability and smooth alignment. For longer moves, stack panels flat on a trolley to reduce handling time. When dismantling, the removable feet make disassembly faster and easier. Furthermore, by labelling stacks by colour, teams can deploy specific barrier zones quickly at multi-area events.Safety and planningEffective crowd management always starts with planning. Therefore, assess routes, crowd capacity, and emergency access before each event. In addition, ensure all barricades are placed to maintain safe spacing and clear visibility. Follow official UK guidance on crowd management from the HSEhere. With careful preparation, you\u2019ll create safer and more efficient spaces for both visitors and staff.Related products<ul> <li>All metal barricades</li> <li>Barricade Storage Option</li> <li>Safety Guidance</li></ul>Specifications<ul> <li>Length: 1.8\u00a0m (compact)</li> <li>Frame: welded steel</li> <li>Finish: yellow, high-visibility</li> <li>Feet: removable, stack-friendly</li> <li>Connections: hook-and-loop ends</li> <li>Use: indoor and outdoor (as conditions allow)</li></ul>SummaryOverall, the <strong>Yellow Steel Crowd Barricade</strong> provides durable crowd control, fast layouts, and excellent visibility for events and public spaces.

      "description": "The Ultimate Vertical Heavy Duty Sign Frame for Rope Stanchions Secure Your Message in Style and Durability Introducing the ultimate solution for clear, prominent signage in any environment The Vertical Heavy Duty Sign Frame designed specifically to attach seamlessly to your rope stanchions is engineered for exceptional durability and ease of use. This frame boasts a substantial 19mm border, providing a robust and professional presentation for your important messages, making it perfectly suited for even the busiest high-traffic zones. Its versatile design offers a choice between two convenient sizes ensuring you can find the perfect fit for your specific needs and display space. The clever top-opening mechanism allows for incredibly simple sign insertion and replacement. No more struggling with complicated installations This intuitive design lets you effortlessly slide your signs in and out, saving you valuable time and effort. You have the flexibility to use 6mm thick sign material directly within the frame, or opt for the convenience of our frames supplied with two sheets of clear protective acrylic, perfect for showcasing your signs behind a crystal-clear barrier. Please note that signs are sold separately. To securely attach this heavy-duty frame to your stanchions, tapping is required. This process creates a reliable screw thread in the stanchion top, ensuring a sturdy connection for any sign frame from our extensive range. It is important to note that only stanchions with crown or flat tops can be tapped for this purpose; stanchions with ball tops are not compatible. We understand that compatibility is key, which is why we offer a variety of studs to ensure a perfect fit with all major stanchion brands. Furthermore, for those requiring signage solutions beyond indoor applications, this Heavy Duty Sign Frame can be weatherized to withstand the elements, making it a dependable choice for outdoor use as well, protecting your important information from rain and sun. The product is visually represented by an image showing a sturdy, rectangular sign holder designed to be mounted on top of a post stanchion. The frame itself is black with a significant border, likely the 19mm mentioned, giving it a substantial and professional appearance. The sign area within the frame appears to be vertical, confirming the product's name. The material looks like durable plastic or metal, built to withstand frequent handling and the rigors of a busy environment. The top edge of the frame shows a clear opening, consistent with the description of an easy-slide in feature for sign insertion. The design prioritizes functionality and robustness, aiming to provide a secure and easily updatable display solution.",

They are built with durable 32mm steel tubing and 1cm steel uprights, creating a robust structure. The 12 uprights ensure maximum rigidity, and their secure fit into the frame before welding guarantees exceptional strength. The flat feet of the barricades are designed for smooth surfaces like tarmac, minimizing the risk of pedestrian trips. For permanent installations, the flat feet can be bolted to the ground. The feet are also removable for easy stacking, providing a convenient storage solution. These barricades seamlessly integrate with the industry-standard hook and half-loop fastening system, allowing you to build crowd control barriers of any length. Included with the barricades is a heavy-duty cart made from thick gauge steel, built to withstand heavy use. The cart can transport up to 30 barricades and features extending arms, capable of carrying 15 barricades on each side. The side-loading design eliminates the need for lifting, requiring only a small height adjustment for loading.

Altogether, the <strong>10.6 m Belt Wall Barrier</strong> brings flexibility and order to almost any layout. </p> Installation and compatibility <p> Mount the unit securely to walls, posts, or racking using the proper bracket. Then connect it to belt receivers and endpoints for a clean, professional finish. Because the enclosed cassette protects the webbing from dust and impact, the mechanism lasts longer and performs reliably. Consequently, you enjoy consistent operation and reduced maintenance across multiple locations. </p> Visibility, messages, and branding options <p> Choose bright colours or hazard stripes to attract attention and increase safety. Moreover, you can add printed safety messages for instant recognition. If you prefer a professional, branded appearance, request custom belts printed with your company logo or site instructions. This extra visual touch strengthens your brand identity while promoting clear communication. </p> Safety guidance for 10.6 m Belt Wall Barrier installations <p> Always plan pedestrian routes and crossing points carefully so movement remains safe and efficient.

      "description": "Black A3 Outdoor Floor Sign Stand for Pavement Queues and Entrances 297mm x 420mm Introducing the Black A3 Outdoor Floor Sign Stand, an essential piece of equipment for any retail environment needing clear, durable signage in outdoor settings. This A3 size sign stand measures precisely 297mm x 420mm, perfect for displaying important information such as menus, notices, promotional offers, or wayfinding instructions. The sleek satin-black finish on both the post and the frame lends a premium and modern aesthetic, seamlessly blending with contemporary venue designs. Engineered for durability and stability, this stand features a robust, heavy-duty rubber base. This specially designed base not only resists scuffs and splashes from everyday use but also provides exceptional stability on various outdoor surfaces including paving and concrete, minimising the risk of it tipping over even in busy areas. The low centre of gravity further enhances its stable footprint, making it ideal for high-traffic locations like shop entrances, pavement queues, garden centres, forecourts, stadium concourses, and transport hubs. Designed with practicality in mind, the A3 sign holder is weather-ready, ensuring your displayed content remains protected and visible. A crucial feature is the anti-glare cover, which ensures that inserts remain readable in diverse and changing light conditions, preventing sun glare from obscuring vital information. Furthermore, the quick-change frame mechanism allows for incredibly fast updates, meaning you can swap out menus, notices, or directional signs with ease and speed. For setup, you can either slide printed sheets between the protective covers or use a rigid A3 board to achieve a perfectly flat and professional display. Maintaining the stand is straightforward; clean the frame with a soft cloth and a mild cleaner, and rinse the rubber base as needed, remembering to avoid strong solvents and abrasive pads to preserve its finish. While built to withstand outdoor conditions, for maximum longevity and safety, it is recommended to bring the stand indoors during severe weather or high winds. This Black A3 Outdoor Floor Sign Stand offers a reliable, stylish, and adaptable solution for all your external display needs, ensuring your message is seen and understood.",

      "description": "Discover the Ultimate Invisible Queue Management Solution Mini Floor Socket For Use With Removable Barrier Posts In Satin Stainless Steel Revolutionize your space management with our Mini Floor Socket, an ingenious solution designed for seamless queue management and exceptional aesthetics. This mini floor mounted socket offers a sophisticated alternative to bulky stanchion bases, ensuring your walkways remain unobstructed and your premium spaces maintain their visual appeal. The primary benefit of this innovative design is its incredibly compact body, boasting a significantly smaller footprint than traditional sockets. This discreet size means that when your barrier posts are removed and the included low-profile cap is in place, the socket becomes virtually invisible, offering a clean and unobtrusive finish that sits completely flush to the floor. This flush design not only enhances the overall look of your environment but also significantly lowers the trip risk for pedestrians, creating a safer and more accessible area. Crafted from high-quality satin stainless steel, this mini floor socket is built to withstand the demands of high-traffic environments, making it an ideal choice for a variety of demanding locations. Its robust construction ensures durability and longevity, providing a reliable queue management system for years to come. The socket's ingenious design allows for quick and easy unscrewing of barrier posts, facilitating hassle-free cleaning, efficient event setups, or unobstructed deliveries. This flexibility makes it perfect for dynamic environments where adaptability is key. To ensure compatibility with your existing stanchions, the Mini Floor Socket requires a compatible mini male floor-socket adaptor. We offer adaptors to match various post tube sizes, so it's crucial to select the adaptor that precisely matches your post's specifications. Please confirm your post tube thread or taper before making your purchase to guarantee a perfect fit. This versatile system, when paired with matching receivers, supports the creation of straight runs, corners, and complex returns, allowing you to design a queue layout that perfectly suits your unique needs. Typical applications for this sophisticated queuing system include bustling airports, dynamic stadiums, informative museums, and captivating visitor attractions. It's also an excellent solution for retail entrances, busy ticket halls, and elegant corporate lobbies. Furthermore, its space-saving design makes it invaluable for event venues and back-of-house areas where floor space is at a premium and efficiency is paramount. You can even integrate fixed and removable posts within the same layout by using these mini floor mounted barrier sockets where removal is needed, and standard bases elsewhere, offering unparalleled control over your pedestrian flow. Installation is a straightforward process, though professional installation is highly recommended for optimal results, especially for structural floors. The basic steps involve core-drilling to the required mini depth and diameter, setting the socket perfectly vertical using resin or grout, and allowing it to cure. Once cured, the flush cap is fitted level with the finished floor, and finally, the mini male adaptor is attached to your barrier post, ready for insertion. For wet zones, it is advisable to consult with your installer about appropriate sealing or drainage solutions. What's included with your purchase is the satin stainless mini floor socket itself, the essential low-profile flush cap, and a basic installation guide to assist you. The internal diameter is available in mini sizes, which you will select to match your specific post tube. It features a reduced, compact depth making it ideal for shallow slabs and retrofitting projects. The recommended use is for indoor environments with sealed floors such as tile, stone, or concrete. Experience the elegance of a virtually invisible queue management system that combines functionality, durability, and superior aesthetics.",

Setting up your display is straightforward. Simply slide your printed sheets between the protective covers or if you prefer a perfectly flat display you can insert a rigid A4 board. Cleaning and care are equally hassle free. The frame can be wiped clean with a soft cloth and a mild cleaning solution. The rubber base can be rinsed as needed to remove dirt and debris. For the preservation of the materials please avoid using strong solvents or abrasive pads during cleaning. This versatile Black A4 Outdoor Floor Sign Stand is more than just a sign holder it is an investment in clear effective and stylish communication for your business ensuring your message always reaches your audience with impact and sophistication. Its dimensions of 210mm by 297mm make it perfectly sized for all your A4 display needs.",
