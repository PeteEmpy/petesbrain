      "description": "Patio Grout - Brush In Jointing Compound | GLEAN - Grey | Effortless Application, All-Weather Use, Durable Finish, Multi-Surface Compatibility GLEAN Brush-In Jointing Compound in Grey is a revolutionary ready-to-use, self-setting grout designed for swift and effortless jointing of patios, driveways, and paths. Its remarkable formulation makes it perfect for both seasoned professionals and enthusiastic DIYers. Unlike traditional grouts that demand specialized tools and expertise, GLEAN\u2019s brush-in application allows for simple and efficient use, saving you time and effort. This superior grout boasts a durable, long-lasting finish that stands the test of time and diverse weather conditions. The remarkable all-weather application feature makes it a standout product. You can confidently apply GLEAN even in rainy conditions, eliminating scheduling hassles associated with traditional grouts. Post-application sealing is completely unnecessary, adding to its low-maintenance and long-lasting attributes; ensuring a significant reduction in long-term upkeep. This truly is a hassle free and user-friendly option. GLEAN\u2019s versatility extends to its compatibility with a wide range of paving materials. It works seamlessly with stone, slate, clay, concrete, terracotta, and paving slabs. However, optimal results require a minimum joint depth of 20mm and a width of at least 5mm; it is not suitable for narrow joints. This product is also a multi surface application ideal for patios, block paving, driveways, and pathways, allowing for seamless consistent finishes across multiple exterior spaces. The curing process is straightforward and predictable, although weather conditions impact the timeline. While the initial setting time is approximately 24-48 hours under dry conditions, complete curing may take between 3 and 7 days, depending on temperature and moisture levels. The product is completely walkable after 24 hours in dry conditions offering convenient speed. Cold, damp or wet weather will naturally prolong the curing times. To enhance longevity and ease of use, the formulation of the GLEAN grout is specifically freeze-thaw resistant for guaranteed weather resilience even during severe temperature changes. To ensure long term usability, GLEAN Brush-In Jointing Compound also offers practical storage solutions for any leftover product. It is essential to pour unused compound back into the original tub and cover it thoroughly with at least 50mm (2 inches) of water. This clever storage method keeps the grout usable for months. It's crucial to remember that once exposed to the air, the grout will set permanently hard; creating an attractive and durable finish for all applications. This product, classified as Protective Coatings & Sealants, offers an unparalleled balance of ease of use, long-lasting durability, and all-weather application, making it a top choice for any paving project.",

      "description": "HELPS PREVENT SLIPS & FALLS: Perfect for slippery areas like bathrooms, kitchens, stairways, patios, pathways and more. \n   SUITABLE FOR USE ON: Porcelain, Ceramic, Brick, Concrete, Terrazzo, Quarry, Slate, Travertine and other natural stone; including showers and bathtubs. \n   COATING OR TREATMENT: This product is a stone surface treatment and not a coating. This specially developed formula etches stone and tile surfaces, creating microscopic grooves to increase adhesion in minutes. \n   INDOOR & OUTDOOR: Can be used in many different environments such as kitchens, porcelain and ceramic bathtubs, tiled showers, bathroom floors, wet rooms, garages, pool areas, restaurants, factories, retirement homes, sports clubs and health clubs. \n   NATURAL FINISH: While initially yellowish, the product will become transparent and cause no visual variation to the current surface. \n   SIMPLE APPLICATION: Apply directly to clean surface using a clean cloth, brush or sprayer, wait 3 minutes and test using a shoe (ideally creep should be less than 25mm). Do not let dry and reapply if necessary. Once the required level of slip resistance has been achieved, neutralise the surface with a mixture of baking soda and water. Rinse thoroughly and leave to dry.",

      "description": "GLEAN BRUSH-IN JOINTING COMPOUND: A ready-to-use, self-setting grout designed to make jointing patios, driveways, and paths fast and effortless. Durable, long-lasting finish, makes it the ideal choice for both DIYers and professionals. \n   ALL-WEATHER APPLICATION: This jointing compound can be applied in most weathers, even in the rain. No sealing is required after application, making it a low-maintenance, long-lasting solution for all types of outdoor paving. Requires no specialist tools, for an easy and efficient application. \n   MULTI SURFACE: Ideal for patios, block paving, driveways, and paths, it is suitable for use with stone, slate, clay, concrete, terracotta, and paving slabs. \n   COVERAGE: Requires a minimum joint depth of 25mm (preferably 30mm). Do not use on joints narrower than 3mm. \n   SETTING TIME: Initial Setting Time: 24-48 hours (dry conditions). Full Cure Time: 3-7 days, depending on temperature and moisture levels. Can Be Walked On: After 24 hours in dry conditions. Cold, damp, wet weather can slow curing times. The formula is freeze-thaw resistant. \n   STORAGE: Pour unused compound back into the tub and cover it with at least 50mm (2 inches) of water. This will keep it usable for several months, provided it remains submerged. Once exposed to air, the grout will set hard for a professional, long-lasting finish.",

Durable, long-lasting finish, makes it the ideal choice for both DIYers and professionals. \n   ALL-WEATHER APPLICATION: This jointing compound can be applied in most weathers, even in the rain. No sealing is required after application, making it a low-maintenance, long-lasting solution for all types of outdoor paving. Requires no specialist tools, for an easy and efficient application. \n   MULTI SURFACE: Ideal for patios, block paving, driveways, and paths, it is suitable for use with stone, slate, clay, concrete, terracotta, and paving slabs. \n   COVERAGE: Requires a minimum joint depth of 25mm (preferably 30mm). Do not use on joints narrower than 3mm. \n   SETTING TIME: Initial Setting Time: 24-48 hours (dry conditions). Full Cure Time: 3-7 days, depending on temperature and moisture levels. Can Be Walked On: After 24 hours in dry conditions. Cold, damp, wet weather can slow curing times. The formula is freeze-thaw resistant. \n   STORAGE: Pour unused compound back into the tub and cover it with at least 50mm (2 inches) of water. This will keep it usable for several months, provided it remains submerged. Once exposed to air, the grout will set hard for a professional, long-lasting finish.",

      "description": "GLEAN BRUSH-IN JOINTING COMPOUND: A ready-to-use, self-setting grout designed to make jointing patios, driveways, and paths fast and effortless. Durable, long-lasting finish, makes it the ideal choice for both DIYers and professionals. \n   ALL-WEATHER APPLICATION: This jointing compound can be applied in most weathers, even in the rain. No sealing is required after application, making it a low-maintenance, long-lasting solution for all types of outdoor paving. Requires no specialist tools, for an easy and efficient application. \n   MULTI SURFACE: Ideal for patios, block paving, driveways, and paths, it is suitable for use with stone, slate, clay, concrete, terracotta, and paving slabs. \n   COVERAGE: Requires a minimum joint depth of 25mm (preferably 30mm). Do not use on joints narrower than 3mm. \n   SETTING TIME: Initial Setting Time: 24-48 hours (dry conditions). Full Cure Time: 3-7 days, depending on temperature and moisture levels. Can Be Walked On: After 24 hours in dry conditions. Cold, damp, wet weather can slow curing times. The formula is freeze-thaw resistant. \n   STORAGE: Pour unused compound back into the tub and cover it with at least 50mm (2 inches) of water. This will keep it usable for several months, provided it remains submerged. Once exposed to air, the grout will set hard for a professional, long-lasting finish.",

Do not let dry and reapply if necessary. Once the required level of slip resistance has been achieved, neutralise the surface with a mixture of baking soda and water.
