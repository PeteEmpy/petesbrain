The longitude markings on the base let you arrange the planets in their correct positions on specific days with the help of the chart in the guide booklet.\n\n The Geosafari Solar System and Planetarium is really two astronomy discovery projects in one. Fit the Star Dome over the light to project a starscape on the walls and ceiling, with all the major constellations labelled.\n\n The guide booklet is packed with useful information about our Solar System, together with suggestions for fun activities.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * Central Tower \n * 8 planets \n * 8 metal rods to attach planets to the central tower \n * Sun sphere \n * Northern hemisphere star dome \n * Krypton bulb  Requires 4 AA batteries, supplied separately\n\n Age 8+",

          "Transform your bedroom into a planetarium! This motor-driven planetarium uses lights and motion to bring our Solar System to life as the 8 planets orbit the Sun. The ultra-bright 1000-hour light used in the Sun, together with its black base, produces truly spectacular results in a darkened room.\n\n The planets are marked with symbols for ease of identification and the 4-way switch allows you to turn on the light and the motor together or independently. The longitude markings on the base let you arrange the planets in their correct positions on specific days with the help of the chart in the guide booklet.\n\n The Geosafari Solar System and Planetarium is really two astronomy discovery projects in one. Fit the Star Dome over the light to project a starscape on the walls and ceiling, with all the major constellations labelled.\n\n The guide booklet is packed with useful information about our Solar System, together with suggestions for fun activities.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * Central Tower \n * 8 planets \n * 8 metal rods to attach planets to the central tower \n * Sun sphere \n * Northern hemisphere star dome \n * Krypton bulb  Requires 4 AA batteries, supplied separately\n\n Age 8+",

          "Transform your bedroom into a planetarium! This motor-driven planetarium uses lights and motion to bring our Solar System to life as the 8 planets orbit the Sun. The ultra-bright 1000-hour light used in the Sun, together with its black base, produces truly spectacular results in a darkened room.\n\n The planets are marked with symbols for ease of identification and the 4-way switch allows you to turn on the light and the motor together or independently. The longitude markings on the base let you arrange the planets in their correct positions on specific days with the help of the chart in the guide booklet.\n\n The Geosafari Solar System and Planetarium is really two astronomy discovery projects in one. Fit the Star Dome over the light to project a starscape on the walls and ceiling, with all the major constellations labelled.\n\n The guide booklet is packed with useful information about our Solar System, together with suggestions for fun activities.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * Central Tower \n * 8 planets \n * 8 metal rods to attach planets to the central tower \n * Sun sphere \n * Northern hemisphere star dome \n * Krypton bulb  Requires 4 AA batteries, supplied separately\n\n Age 8+",

          "Transform your bedroom into a planetarium! This motor-driven planetarium uses lights and motion to bring our Solar System to life as the 8 planets orbit the Sun. The ultra-bright 1000-hour light used in the Sun, together with its black base, produces truly spectacular results in a darkened room.\n\n The planets are marked with symbols for ease of identification and the 4-way switch allows you to turn on the light and the motor together or independently. The longitude markings on the base let you arrange the planets in their correct positions on specific days with the help of the chart in the guide booklet.\n\n The Geosafari Solar System and Planetarium is really two astronomy discovery projects in one. Fit the Star Dome over the light to project a starscape on the walls and ceiling, with all the major constellations labelled.\n\n The guide booklet is packed with useful information about our Solar System, together with suggestions for fun activities.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * Central Tower \n * 8 planets \n * 8 metal rods to attach planets to the central tower \n * Sun sphere \n * Northern hemisphere star dome \n * Krypton bulb  Requires 4 AA batteries, supplied separately\n\n Age 8+",

The ultra-bright 1000-hour light used in the Sun, together with its black base, produces truly spectacular results in a darkened room.\n\n The planets are marked with symbols for ease of identification and the 4-way switch allows you to turn on the light and the motor together or independently. The longitude markings on the base let you arrange the planets in their correct positions on specific days with the help of the chart in the guide booklet.\n\n The Geosafari Solar System and Planetarium is really two astronomy discovery projects in one. Fit the Star Dome over the light to project a starscape on the walls and ceiling, with all the major constellations labelled.\n\n The guide booklet is packed with useful information about our Solar System, together with suggestions for fun activities.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * Central Tower \n * 8 planets \n * 8 metal rods to attach planets to the central tower \n * Sun sphere \n * Northern hemisphere star dome \n * Krypton bulb  Requires 4 AA batteries, supplied separately\n\n Age 8+",

          "Transform your bedroom into a planetarium! This motor-driven planetarium uses lights and motion to bring our Solar System to life as the 8 planets orbit the Sun. The ultra-bright 1000-hour light used in the Sun, together with its black base, produces truly spectacular results in a darkened room.\n\n The planets are marked with symbols for ease of identification and the 4-way switch allows you to turn on the light and the motor together or independently. The longitude markings on the base let you arrange the planets in their correct positions on specific days with the help of the chart in the guide booklet.\n\n The Geosafari Solar System and Planetarium is really two astronomy discovery projects in one. Fit the Star Dome over the light to project a starscape on the walls and ceiling, with all the major constellations labelled.\n\n The guide booklet is packed with useful information about our Solar System, together with suggestions for fun activities.\n\n Contents:\n\n  \n * Central Tower \n * 8 planets \n * 8 metal rods to attach planets to the central tower \n * Sun sphere \n * Northern hemisphere star dome \n * Krypton bulb  Requires 4 AA batteries, supplied separately\n\n Age 8+",
