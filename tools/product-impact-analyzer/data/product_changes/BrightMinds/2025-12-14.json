Experiment with push buttons and on-off switches. Assemble circuits that include a spinning motor, two switches, and up to three light bulbs.\n\n Conduct tests to see which materials are magnetic. Learn about the force of magnetism and magnetic poles. Magnetise a metal. Use iron fillings to make invisible magnetic fields visible. Investigate magnetic force and direction with a magnetic pendulum device. Learn how a compass works and about Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Conduct a series of experiments with a sturdy electromagnet.\n\n Finally, put everything you have learned to good use by constructing a loudspeaker, an electromagnetic relay switch, and a morse code telegraph key.\n\n The components are specially designed to make learning fun and accessible. The electrical blocks fit together with simple plug and- socket connectors. Because the blocks are brightly coloured and have unique shapes, it is easy to follow the assembly diagrams to construct functional devices.\n\n The 64-page, full-colour experiment manual guides you through experiments with easy-to follow diagrams.\n\n Age 8+",

          "Djeco Bead Loom Bracelets Craft Kit Create Stunning Beaded Bracelets for Ages 8-14 This delightful Djeco Bead Loom Bracelets kit invites young crafters into a world of vibrant color and intricate design, making it the perfect way to spark creativity and a sense of accomplishment. Get ready for hours of engaging fun as children aged 8 to 14 can dive into the satisfying art of creating beautiful, personalized bracelets. The heart of this kit is the specially designed loom, a user-friendly tool that makes threading tiny glass beads an accessible and enjoyable experience. It\u2019s the ideal platform for weaving together stunning patterns, much like the popular American Bead style, allowing for a sophisticated and stylish final product. Imagine the joy of selecting from eight vibrant tubes of colorful glass beads, each a tiny jewel waiting to be strung. Kids will have a blast experimenting with color combinations, mixing and matching hues to invent their very own unique patterns that truly express their individual style. This isn't just about making pretty accessories; it\u2019s a wonderfully enriching activity that fosters crucial developmental skills. As little hands meticulously thread each bead, they\u2019ll be enhancing their concentration and fine motor skills.

          "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

          "Kidnoculars binoculars for little ones. I cannot begin to say what a difference these 'Kidnocular' binoculars make to young children. The wrap-around soft eye section makes is so easy for little ones to look through the binoculars - it holds their face in the correct position and keeps things steady, plus it blocks out the peripheral vision so that children really can use the binoculars with ease.\n\n The Geosafari kidnoculars are very sturdy but also incredibly comfortable and lightweight to hold. With nice and clear 2x magnification these are the perfect first pair of binoculars for all nature lovers and would-be secret agents.\n\n   \n * Encourages interaction with the natural world \n * Ideal for role-play  Kidnoculars Dimensions: 18 x 14 x 7 cm\n Manufacturers recommended age: 3+ yrs",

          "Kidnoculars binoculars for little ones. I cannot begin to say what a difference these 'Kidnocular' binoculars make to young children. The wrap-around soft eye section makes is so easy for little ones to look through the binoculars - it holds their face in the correct position and keeps things steady, plus it blocks out the peripheral vision so that children really can use the binoculars with ease.\n\n The Geosafari kidnoculars are very sturdy but also incredibly comfortable and lightweight to hold. With nice and clear 2x magnification these are the perfect first pair of binoculars for all nature lovers and would-be secret agents.\n\n   \n * Encourages interaction with the natural world \n * Ideal for role-play  Kidnoculars Dimensions: 18 x 14 x 7 cm\n Manufacturers recommended age: 3+ yrs",

          "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",
          "Djeco presents Zig & Go, a wooden building game of chain reactions requiring careful thinking.

Construction game: children will need to use skill to position the pieces to make a course. Chain reaction game: children get to learn about the ingenuity and magic of chains of movement!

          "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

The wrap-around soft eye section makes is so easy for little ones to look through the binoculars - it holds their face in the correct position and keeps things steady, plus it blocks out the peripheral vision so that children really can use the binoculars with ease.\n\n The Geosafari kidnoculars are very sturdy but also incredibly comfortable and lightweight to hold. With nice and clear 2x magnification these are the perfect first pair of binoculars for all nature lovers and would-be secret agents.\n\n   \n * Encourages interaction with the natural world \n * Ideal for role-play  Kidnoculars Dimensions: 18 x 14 x 7 cm\n Manufacturers recommended age: 3+ yrs",

Investigate magnetic force and direction with a magnetic pendulum device. Learn how a compass works and about Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Conduct a series of experiments with a sturdy electromagnet.\n\n Finally, put everything you have learned to good use by constructing a loudspeaker, an electromagnetic relay switch, and a morse code telegraph key.\n\n The components are specially designed to make learning fun and accessible. The electrical blocks fit together with simple plug and- socket connectors.

          "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

          "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

The wrap-around soft eye section makes is so easy for little ones to look through the binoculars - it holds their face in the correct position and keeps things steady, plus it blocks out the peripheral vision so that children really can use the binoculars with ease.\n\n The Geosafari kidnoculars are very sturdy but also incredibly comfortable and lightweight to hold. With nice and clear 2x magnification these are the perfect first pair of binoculars for all nature lovers and would-be secret agents.\n\n   \n * Encourages interaction with the natural world \n * Ideal for role-play  Kidnoculars Dimensions: 18 x 14 x 7 cm\n Manufacturers recommended age: 3+ yrs",

          "Conduct more than 60 electrifying experiments with circuits and magnetic contraptions to learn about electricity and magnetism, and how these two fundamental properties are closely related. Children eight and up can safely and easily experiment with electric current and magnetic fields using the colourful snap-together blocks and components in this hands-on kit.\n\n Build series and parallel circuits to light up a light bulb. Experiment with push buttons and on-off switches. Assemble circuits that include a spinning motor, two switches, and up to three light bulbs.\n\n Conduct tests to see which materials are magnetic. Learn about the force of magnetism and magnetic poles. Magnetise a metal. Use iron fillings to make invisible magnetic fields visible. Investigate magnetic force and direction with a magnetic pendulum device. Learn how a compass works and about Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Conduct a series of experiments with a sturdy electromagnet.\n\n Finally, put everything you have learned to good use by constructing a loudspeaker, an electromagnetic relay switch, and a morse code telegraph key.\n\n The components are specially designed to make learning fun and accessible. The electrical blocks fit together with simple plug and- socket connectors. Because the blocks are brightly coloured and have unique shapes, it is easy to follow the assembly diagrams to construct functional devices.\n\n The 64-page, full-colour experiment manual guides you through experiments with easy-to follow diagrams.\n\n Age 8+",

But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

Children copy the 3 designs in the instructions booklet to build courses, or make up their own - the possibilities are endless!

          "Kidnoculars binoculars for little ones. I cannot begin to say what a difference these 'Kidnocular' binoculars make to young children. The wrap-around soft eye section makes is so easy for little ones to look through the binoculars - it holds their face in the correct position and keeps things steady, plus it blocks out the peripheral vision so that children really can use the binoculars with ease.\n\n The Geosafari kidnoculars are very sturdy but also incredibly comfortable and lightweight to hold. With nice and clear 2x magnification these are the perfect first pair of binoculars for all nature lovers and would-be secret agents.\n\n   \n * Encourages interaction with the natural world \n * Ideal for role-play  Kidnoculars Dimensions: 18 x 14 x 7 cm\n Manufacturers recommended age: 3+ yrs",

Learn about the force of magnetism and magnetic poles. Magnetise a metal. Use iron fillings to make invisible magnetic fields visible. Investigate magnetic force and direction with a magnetic pendulum device. Learn how a compass works and about Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Conduct a series of experiments with a sturdy electromagnet.\n\n Finally, put everything you have learned to good use by constructing a loudspeaker, an electromagnetic relay switch, and a morse code telegraph key.\n\n The components are specially designed to make learning fun and accessible. The electrical blocks fit together with simple plug and- socket connectors.

          "Zig & Go Wroom 45 Piece Chain Reaction Wooden Building Game for Endless Imaginative Play and STEM LearningGet ready for a wild ride of exciting experiments and amazing inventions with Zig & Go Wroom! This fantastic wooden building game from Djeco is more than just a toy; it's an adventure into the wonderful world of chain reactions and critical thinking, perfect for sparking curiosity in young minds. Imagine your child's delight as they meticulously arrange the 45 sturdy, FSC certified wooden pieces, including smooth metal marbles, to create their very own miniature Rube Goldberg-esque machines. This isn't just about building; it's about understanding cause and effect in a tangible, hands-on way that makes learning feel like pure magic. The Zig & Go Wroom kit comes packed with everything needed to get started. Inside, you'll find 45 durable wooden pieces, each designed for smooth movement and satisfying clicks as they interact, along with 5 gleaming metal marbles that will zip and zoom through the courses you create. To guide your initial explorations, there\u2019s a helpful 24-page instruction booklet showcasing three different designs that demonstrate the core principles of the game. These step-by-step guides are perfect for introducing younger builders to the concepts of spatial reasoning and sequential logic. But the fun truly blossoms when children move beyond the instructions and begin to dream up their own ingenious contraptions. The possibilities are truly endless, limited only by a child's imagination. This game is expertly crafted to encourage a variety of crucial developmental skills. As children plan and assemble their courses, they are naturally engaging in problem-solving and developing their fine motor skills. They\u2019ll learn to think critically about how weight affects speed and how to accurately gauge distances between elements to ensure a perfect cascade of movement. It\u2019s a fantastic way to introduce the foundational principles of STEM in a way that\u2019s incredibly engaging and enjoyable, all while playing. The game is designed for children aged 7 and up, making it a perfect activity for elementary schoolers who are ready for a delightful challenge. Plus, a QR code grants access to a helpful video, offering even more inspiration and guidance for your budding engineer. The beauty of the Zig & Go collection is that all the kits are compatible, meaning that as your child\u2019s passion for chain reactions grows, they can seamlessly combine different sets to build ever more elaborate and spectacular courses, leading to hours upon hours of inventive, solo or group play. The FSC certified wood ensures that you\u2019re making an eco-conscious choice for your family.",

          "Kidnoculars binoculars for little ones. I cannot begin to say what a difference these 'Kidnocular' binoculars make to young children. The wrap-around soft eye section makes is so easy for little ones to look through the binoculars - it holds their face in the correct position and keeps things steady, plus it blocks out the peripheral vision so that children really can use the binoculars with ease.\n\n The Geosafari kidnoculars are very sturdy but also incredibly comfortable and lightweight to hold. With nice and clear 2x magnification these are the perfect first pair of binoculars for all nature lovers and would-be secret agents.\n\n   \n * Encourages interaction with the natural world \n * Ideal for role-play  Kidnoculars Dimensions: 18 x 14 x 7 cm\n Manufacturers recommended age: 3+ yrs",
