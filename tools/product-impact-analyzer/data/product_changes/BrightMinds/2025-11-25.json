          "My First Coding and Robotics Kit: A Fun Journey into Programming and Engineering! Get ready for an exciting adventure into the world of coding and robotics with the My First Coding and Robotics Kit! This fantastic set is designed to introduce young minds, ages 4 to 8, to the fundamentals of programming in a super engaging and hands-on way. Forget about needing screens or complex devices; this kit uses clever physical code cards that your adorable robot pal, Sammy, reads with its special optical identifier sensor on its underside. Simply lay out a sequence of these code cards, and watch as Sammy understands its mission! Once programmed, place Sammy on a grid made of map cards, and get ready to see your creations come to life! Sammy can be programmed to zoom in different directions, activate its integrated output gear for fun moving parts like arms, flash its colorful LED lights, and even play cheerful sounds. The possibilities are endless as your child learns to think like a programmer and an engineer. The built-in output gear is a game-changer, allowing kids to build simple robotic creations that respond to their coded commands, fostering creativity and a sense of accomplishment. This kit is more than just play; it's a brilliant introduction to physical engineering and essential problem-solving skills through a series of progressively challenging building and coding lessons. These 30 illustrated lessons are expertly crafted and aligned with important computer science education standards from organizations like CSTA and ISTE, and even courses from Code.org, ensuring a valuable learning experience. The full-color illustrated manual, which can be accessed online for convenience, provides step-by-step guidance for both coding lessons and model assembly, making it perfect for adult-child collaboration or independent exploration for older kids. The lessons cleverly cover six key coding areas: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables, all presented in a way that feels like fun and discovery. Sammy isn't the only star; the kit includes five other engaging stories with related model-building and coding challenges. Imagine a mouse navigating a maze to find cheese, a penguin exploring a zoo, a soccer player scoring a goal, a fire truck bravely putting out a blaze, or a factory robot efficiently completing its tasks. Each scenario provides a unique context for applying learned coding concepts. To power Sammy's adventures, you'll need 3 AA batteries, which are conveniently supplied separately. This kit truly makes learning about technology an enjoyable and accessible experience for the whole family.",
          "My First Coding and Robotics is a brilliant starter kit to teach coding principles with a cute little robot. You don\u2019t need a tablet, smartphone, or computer to program this robot; programs are created by simply laying down a sequence of physical code cards.\n\n As the robot drives over the code cards, an Optical identifier sensor or optical scanner on the bottom of the robot, reads the code cards one by one and loads the program. Next, place the robot on a grid made of map cards, and the robot runs the program. You can program the robot to move in different directions, activate its output gear, light up its LED, play sounds, and respond to different function cards. The integrated output gear makes it possible to build simple robotic creations with arms or other moving parts that respond according to the program\u2019s instructions.\n\n This robot kit also teaches physical engineering and problem solving skills through a series of building and coding lessons. The 30 lessons are aligned with standards for computer science education developed by the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the International Society for Technology (ISTE) Education, as well as courses from Code.org.\n\n The lessons or activities progress in complexity through the illustrated manual, allowing the kit to be appropriate for a child as young as four years with help from an adult and as old as eight years. The lessons cover these six key areas in coding: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables.\n\n In addition to Sammy (the robot), there are five other stories, each with a series of model-building and coding challenges and lessons related to it: a mouse moves through a maze to find cheese; a penguin wanders around a zoo; a soccer player moves a ball into the goal; a fire truck puts out a fire; and a factory robot performs tasks in a factory scene. A full-colour illustrated manual guides (https://www.thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/567012_Kids-First-Coding&Robotics-Manual.pdf) users through the coding lessons and the assembly of the different models.\n\n Requires 3 AA batteries, supplied separately.\n\n Ages 4 to 8 years."

          "My First Coding and Robotics Kit: A Fun Journey into Programming and Engineering! Get ready for an exciting adventure into the world of coding and robotics with the My First Coding and Robotics Kit! This fantastic set is designed to introduce young minds, ages 4 to 8, to the fundamentals of programming in a super engaging and hands-on way. Forget about needing screens or complex devices; this kit uses clever physical code cards that your adorable robot pal, Sammy, reads with its special optical identifier sensor on its underside. Simply lay out a sequence of these code cards, and watch as Sammy understands its mission! Once programmed, place Sammy on a grid made of map cards, and get ready to see your creations come to life! Sammy can be programmed to zoom in different directions, activate its integrated output gear for fun moving parts like arms, flash its colorful LED lights, and even play cheerful sounds. The possibilities are endless as your child learns to think like a programmer and an engineer. The built-in output gear is a game-changer, allowing kids to build simple robotic creations that respond to their coded commands, fostering creativity and a sense of accomplishment. This kit is more than just play; it's a brilliant introduction to physical engineering and essential problem-solving skills through a series of progressively challenging building and coding lessons. These 30 illustrated lessons are expertly crafted and aligned with important computer science education standards from organizations like CSTA and ISTE, and even courses from Code.org, ensuring a valuable learning experience. The full-color illustrated manual, which can be accessed online for convenience, provides step-by-step guidance for both coding lessons and model assembly, making it perfect for adult-child collaboration or independent exploration for older kids. The lessons cleverly cover six key coding areas: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables, all presented in a way that feels like fun and discovery. Sammy isn't the only star; the kit includes five other engaging stories with related model-building and coding challenges. Imagine a mouse navigating a maze to find cheese, a penguin exploring a zoo, a soccer player scoring a goal, a fire truck bravely putting out a blaze, or a factory robot efficiently completing its tasks. Each scenario provides a unique context for applying learned coding concepts. To power Sammy's adventures, you'll need 3 AA batteries, which are conveniently supplied separately. This kit truly makes learning about technology an enjoyable and accessible experience for the whole family.",
          "My First Coding and Robotics is a brilliant starter kit to teach coding principles with a cute little robot. You don\u2019t need a tablet, smartphone, or computer to program this robot; programs are created by simply laying down a sequence of physical code cards.\n\n As the robot drives over the code cards, an Optical identifier sensor or optical scanner on the bottom of the robot, reads the code cards one by one and loads the program. Next, place the robot on a grid made of map cards, and the robot runs the program. You can program the robot to move in different directions, activate its output gear, light up its LED, play sounds, and respond to different function cards. The integrated output gear makes it possible to build simple robotic creations with arms or other moving parts that respond according to the program\u2019s instructions.\n\n This robot kit also teaches physical engineering and problem solving skills through a series of building and coding lessons. The 30 lessons are aligned with standards for computer science education developed by the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the International Society for Technology (ISTE) Education, as well as courses from Code.org.\n\n The lessons or activities progress in complexity through the illustrated manual, allowing the kit to be appropriate for a child as young as four years with help from an adult and as old as eight years. The lessons cover these six key areas in coding: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables.\n\n In addition to Sammy (the robot), there are five other stories, each with a series of model-building and coding challenges and lessons related to it: a mouse moves through a maze to find cheese; a penguin wanders around a zoo; a soccer player moves a ball into the goal; a fire truck puts out a fire; and a factory robot performs tasks in a factory scene. A full-colour illustrated manual guides (https://www.thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/567012_Kids-First-Coding&Robotics-Manual.pdf) users through the coding lessons and the assembly of the different models.\n\n Requires 3 AA batteries, supplied separately.\n\n Ages 4 to 8 years."

          "My First Coding and Robotics Kit: A Fun Journey into Programming and Engineering! Get ready for an exciting adventure into the world of coding and robotics with the My First Coding and Robotics Kit! This fantastic set is designed to introduce young minds, ages 4 to 8, to the fundamentals of programming in a super engaging and hands-on way. Forget about needing screens or complex devices; this kit uses clever physical code cards that your adorable robot pal, Sammy, reads with its special optical identifier sensor on its underside. Simply lay out a sequence of these code cards, and watch as Sammy understands its mission! Once programmed, place Sammy on a grid made of map cards, and get ready to see your creations come to life! Sammy can be programmed to zoom in different directions, activate its integrated output gear for fun moving parts like arms, flash its colorful LED lights, and even play cheerful sounds. The possibilities are endless as your child learns to think like a programmer and an engineer. The built-in output gear is a game-changer, allowing kids to build simple robotic creations that respond to their coded commands, fostering creativity and a sense of accomplishment. This kit is more than just play; it's a brilliant introduction to physical engineering and essential problem-solving skills through a series of progressively challenging building and coding lessons. These 30 illustrated lessons are expertly crafted and aligned with important computer science education standards from organizations like CSTA and ISTE, and even courses from Code.org, ensuring a valuable learning experience. The full-color illustrated manual, which can be accessed online for convenience, provides step-by-step guidance for both coding lessons and model assembly, making it perfect for adult-child collaboration or independent exploration for older kids. The lessons cleverly cover six key coding areas: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables, all presented in a way that feels like fun and discovery. Sammy isn't the only star; the kit includes five other engaging stories with related model-building and coding challenges. Imagine a mouse navigating a maze to find cheese, a penguin exploring a zoo, a soccer player scoring a goal, a fire truck bravely putting out a blaze, or a factory robot efficiently completing its tasks. Each scenario provides a unique context for applying learned coding concepts. To power Sammy's adventures, you'll need 3 AA batteries, which are conveniently supplied separately. This kit truly makes learning about technology an enjoyable and accessible experience for the whole family.",
          "My First Coding and Robotics is a brilliant starter kit to teach coding principles with a cute little robot. You don\u2019t need a tablet, smartphone, or computer to program this robot; programs are created by simply laying down a sequence of physical code cards.\n\n As the robot drives over the code cards, an Optical identifier sensor or optical scanner on the bottom of the robot, reads the code cards one by one and loads the program. Next, place the robot on a grid made of map cards, and the robot runs the program. You can program the robot to move in different directions, activate its output gear, light up its LED, play sounds, and respond to different function cards. The integrated output gear makes it possible to build simple robotic creations with arms or other moving parts that respond according to the program\u2019s instructions.\n\n This robot kit also teaches physical engineering and problem solving skills through a series of building and coding lessons. The 30 lessons are aligned with standards for computer science education developed by the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the International Society for Technology (ISTE) Education, as well as courses from Code.org.\n\n The lessons or activities progress in complexity through the illustrated manual, allowing the kit to be appropriate for a child as young as four years with help from an adult and as old as eight years. The lessons cover these six key areas in coding: sequencing, loops, events, conditionals, functions, and variables.\n\n In addition to Sammy (the robot), there are five other stories, each with a series of model-building and coding challenges and lessons related to it: a mouse moves through a maze to find cheese; a penguin wanders around a zoo; a soccer player moves a ball into the goal; a fire truck puts out a fire; and a factory robot performs tasks in a factory scene. A full-colour illustrated manual guides (https://www.thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/567012_Kids-First-Coding&Robotics-Manual.pdf) users through the coding lessons and the assembly of the different models.\n\n Requires 3 AA batteries, supplied separately.\n\n Ages 4 to 8 years."
