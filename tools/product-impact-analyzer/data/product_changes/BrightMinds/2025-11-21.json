          "Head-To-Head Codebreaking Challenges... With An Ingenious Twist!\n\n Decypher is a battle of logical deduction as you race to crack your opponent\u2019s code, before they crack your own! Displaying the numbers from 0 to 9 in a digital format uses just seven different vertical and horizontal lines. Discovering which lines appear where in each coded sequence will allow you to narrow down the code\u2019s possibilities. Achieving this more efficiently than your opponent will win you the game! With multiple games and almost endless possible codes, Decypher\u2019s challenges will keep you on the edge of your seat\u2026 and could define you as a master codebreaker!\n\n Box size approx. 28cm x 9cm\n\n Age 8+"
