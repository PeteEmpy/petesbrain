          "Branded Queue Belt Barriers \u2013 20 Pack Product Overview<p>The <strong>Branded Queue Belt Barriers</strong> bundle provides a professional and highly visible solution for queue management and access control. This 10-pack set includes premium stanchions fitted with custom-printed belts, allowing you to display branding, instructions, or safety messaging clearly. As a result, you improve organisation while reinforcing brand presence in busy environments.</p>Professional Queue Control with Custom Branding<p>Through a process called dye sublimation each belt features high-quality digital printing, which ensures logos and messages remain sharp and long-lasting. Moreover, the retractable belt design supports fast layout changes without tools. The 5cm wide, 3.4m belt offers excellent span coverage, while the slow-retract brake system improves safety during use. Consequently, these barriers suit high-traffic locations that demand both control and visual impact.</p>Heavy-Duty Construction for Demanding Environments<p>This Branded Queue Belt Barriers Set uses steel posts combined with a solid cast-iron low-profile base. Therefore, each unit remains stable during constant daily use. Additionally, the full-circumference floor protector helps prevent scuffs and marks on finished flooring. Premium finish options include black, polished stainless steel, and satin stainless steel, allowing easy coordination with your space.</p>Branded Queue Belt Barriers are Ideal for Events, Retail and Public Venues<p>This barrier set works well in retail stores, airports, exhibitions, hospitality venues and corporate spaces. Furthermore, the belt locking mechanism prevents accidental release, which improves safety and reliability. If you require a different belt length or message, customisation options are available on request. Consequently, this bundle delivers flexibility without compromising durability.</p><ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0;\"> <li>\u2611 Custom printed retractable belts</li> <li>\u2611 20-pack bundle for large areas</li> <li>\u2611 3.4m slow-retract safety belt</li> <li>\u2611 Heavy cast-iron base for stability</li> <li>\u2611 Floor-protecting rubber base ring</li> <li>\u2611 Black, polished or satin stainless finishes</li></ul><p>View our full range of retractable belt barriers here.<br>For best-practice crowd guidance, visit the HSE advice here.</p>"
