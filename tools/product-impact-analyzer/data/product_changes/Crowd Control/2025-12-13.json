          "for this Long Range Retractable Barrier<p>The <strong>WallPro 750 Long Range Retractable Barrier</strong> delivers exceptional reach for large or high-traffic areas. Standard barriers often fall short in these environments, but this model spans up to an impressive 23 metres. As a result, it provides strong access control without filling the floor with posts or stands. It is a smart, space-saving choice for warehouses, logistics hubs and industrial sites that need clear visual separation and reliable safety management.</p>Built for Demanding Environments<p>This heavy-duty barrier features a tough ABS housing that resists impacts and daily wear. The robust steel mounting plate keeps the unit secure, even during frequent use. Because it mounts directly to a wall or post, it keeps aisles and walkways free from trip hazards. The slow-retract brake system offers controlled, smooth belt return and reduces the risk of sudden snap-back. As a result, teams can use the unit safely during busy operations.</p>Flexible Belt End Options<p>You can choose from three belt end options to suit different layouts. The <strong>locking end</strong> secures permanently to a receiver clip. The <strong>S-clip end</strong> works by wrapping around posts and fixtures. The <strong>magnetic end</strong> attaches instantly to metal surfaces for fast and tool-free setup. Each option holds the belt firmly in place until intentionally released. In addition, the enclosed cassette design protects the belt from dirt and wear, helping prolong its service life.</p>This Long Range Retractable Barrier is Perfect for Industrial and Commercial Use<p>The <strong>WallPro 750</strong> suits warehouses, factories, airports and maintenance zones that demand clear access control. It works well for closing aisles, marking restricted areas and guiding vehicles or pedestrians. Because the belt extends so far, you need fewer units to cover long spans. This saves time, reduces installation effort and helps maintain a clean, professional environment. Furthermore, the bright belt colours and messages improve visibility and support clear communication.</p><p>Need a fully magnetic version?
