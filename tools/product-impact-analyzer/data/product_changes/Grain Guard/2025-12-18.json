We at GRAIN GUARD are committed to providing only the highest-quality products, and this stain is a testament to that commitment, offering an authentic hardwood finish that lasts.

The application process is simple; just use a clean, dry brush and apply the stain liberally, following the direction of the wood grain. For best results on pine and light hardwoods, refer to the detailed application guide: Antique Stripped Pine, Brown Mahogany, Golden Pine, Light Oak, Light Rosewood, and Medium Oak usually require a single coat, while Dark Pine, Dark Walnut, and Golden Oak typically require one to two coats.

Its quick-drying nature means you can complete your projects faster, saving you valuable time and minimizing disruption. Unlike oil-based stains, cleanup is a breeze, simply washing your brushes with water once finished. This exceptional stain delivers a high-quality finish that brings out the natural beauty of the wood grain, enhancing its character and warmth. We at GRAIN GUARD are committed to providing only the highest-quality products, and this stain is a testament to that commitment, offering an authentic hardwood finish that lasts. This particular Dark Pine shade typically requires one to two coats for optimal color depth, though you can add further coats for a more intense hue. The application process is simple; just use a clean, dry brush and apply the stain liberally, following the direction of the wood grain. For best results on pine and light hardwoods, refer to the detailed application guide: Antique Stripped Pine, Brown Mahogany, Golden Pine, Light Oak, Light Rosewood, and Medium Oak usually require a single coat, while Dark Pine, Dark Walnut, and Golden Oak typically require one to two coats. Black Ebony, English Oak, French Oak, Dark Red Mahogany, and Very Red Mahogany will require two to three coats for optimal coverage. One liter of our stain covers approximately 12 square meters, so this 500ml tin will offer ample coverage for smaller projects. Our comprehensive range also includes a variety of other beautiful colors, allowing you to create a personalized, stylish look for all your wood finishes.
