## Critical Gap: Merchant Center Disapproval Tracking

### Current State
- ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** for any client
- Script exists: `merchant_center_tracker.py`
- Has capability to track product approval/disapproval status via Google Content API
- NOT configured with any merchant account IDs
- NOT scheduled to run automatically

### Impact
- Email to Michael (Clear Prospects) claims: "Merchant Centre disapprovals - the system monitors your product feed every 6 hours and alerts me immediately"
- CONTEXT.md for Clear Prospects claims: "Product Impact Analyzer Merchant Center tracking runs every 6 hours"
- **This functionality does NOT exist**

### Requirements for Implementation
1. Configure merchant account IDs for each client
2. Set up LaunchAgent for 6-hourly runs (6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 12 AM)
3. Integrate with existing snapshot system
4. Implement alert mechanism for disapprovals
5. Add Merchant Center status to daily reports

---

## Action Items

### Priority 1 - CRITICAL
- [ ] Implement Merchant Center disapproval tracking for ALL e-commerce clients
- [ ] Update Clear Prospects CONTEXT.md to reflect actual implementation status
- [ ] Create LaunchAgent for automated Merchant Center monitoring

### Priority 2 - High
- [ ] Create Product Performance spreadsheets for missing e-commerce clients:
  - Bright Minds ⭐
  - Go Glean ⭐
  - Smythson ⭐ (high-value client)
  - Superspace ⭐
  - Uno Lighting ⭐
  - Godshot
  - OTC
  - Print My PDF

### Priority 3 - Medium
- [ ] Enable label tracking for clients with product feeds but no tracking:
  - Bright Minds
  - Go Glean
  - Godshot
  - Just Bin Bags
  - Smythson
  - Superspace
  - Uno Lighting (clean up duplicate folders: uno-lighting vs uno-lights)

### Priority 4 - Low
- [ ] Document which clients are NOT e-commerce and don't need product tracking:
  - Devonshire Hotels (hotel bookings)
  - National Design Academy (lead generation)

## Notes

**Product Feed History vs Label Tracking:**
- Product feed history captures raw Google Ads Shopping data (daily snapshots)
- Label tracking analyzes feeds and assigns Hero/Villain/Sidekick/Zombie classifications
- Some clients have feed history but not label tracking (partial implementation)

**Duplicate Tracking Folders:**
- `uno-lighting/` and `uno-lights/` appear to be duplicates - needs cleanup

**High-Value Clients Missing Tracking:**
- Smythson (luxury brand, high-value client)
- Bright Minds (established e-commerce)
- Superspace (international, AU + UK)
